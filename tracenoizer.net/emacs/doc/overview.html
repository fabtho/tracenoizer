<h2><a name="Abstract">Abstract</a></h2>
<p>
What is <span class="emacro">EMacro</span>? Emacro is a .emacs configuration
system for Emacs. It is:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><b>Easy</b></dt>
<dd>
<span class="emacro">EMacro</span> prompts you once only, and saves your
configuration in an easy to read file.
<br />
You don't need to know elisp, to run Emacs with sane defaults, such as loading
the best available Java mode, when opening *.java files.
<br />
<span class="emacro">EMacro</span> also includes extensive user documentation
<br />
Combine Emacs v21.1 with <span class="emacro">EMacro</span> and cua.el, and new
users can get comfortable immediately! <small>Unfortunately, the XEmacs port of
cua.el is out of date.</small>
</dd>
<dt><b>Extensible</b></dt>
<dd>
<span class="emacro">EMacro</span>'s ease of use does not come at the expense
of advanced users. If you love elisp, you will find <span
class="emacro">EMacro</span>'s code easy to search, with plenty of hints in its
comments.
</dd>
<dt><b>Fast</b></dt>
<dd>
<span class="emacro">EMacro</span> has been optimized for speed. It may double
the number of seconds that Emacs loads, but it will save you minutes, from
searching for, and loading libraries. <span class="emacro">EMacro</span> can be
considered the world's largest .emacs, but still quite manageable in size.
</dd>
<dt><b>Portable</b></dt>
<dd>
It works with Microsoft Windows, Mac OS, and Gnu/Linux compatible systems,
including BSD and Sun Solaris. Others have not been tested, but should
work. <span class="emacro">EMacro</span> works with both Emacs and XEmacs.
</dd>
<dt><b>Complete</b></dt>
<dd>
<span class="emacro">EMacro</span> combines the work of everyone in <a
href="credits.html"> credits.html</a>, in a sense, all the ideas that are good
enough to share.
</dd>
<dt><b>Tested</b></dt>
<dd>
Since <span class="emacro">EMacro</span> is more complete, there is less need
to add code, which will break it. Code for <span class="emacro">EMacro</span>
goes back 10 years. <span class="emacro">EMacro</span> has a team that spends
more time uncovering bugs, under more varieties of conditions, than any other
.emacs.
</dd>
<dt><b>Uniform</b></dt>
<dd>
Stop learning a different editor, every time you switch platforms or
languages. With <span class="emacro">EMacro</span> Libs, you will also find
Emacs more similar to XEmacs. Try the key-themes from the <i>Options</i>
menu, to blend with your favorite Operating System.

<h2><a name="Program">Program Flow</a></h2>
<p>
Emacs first loads ~/.emacs or XEmacs loads ~/.xemacs/init.el.
The <span class="emacro">EMacro</span> tar.gz file calls this file ~/init.el,
to avoid overwriting this file, if you have already created one. If you use a
package, then it is the responsibility of your system to preven file
collisions.
<br />
This init file loads ~/emacs/emacro/e-macro.el, which then loads
emacs/e-path.el. You may need to edit ~/emacs/e-path.el, to find the path to
every Emacs macro library file you expect to use.
<br />
Next, ~/emacs/preferences/e-preload.el is loaded. You can customize this file,
for any user code, before the bulk of <span class="emacro">EMacro</span> is
executed.
<br />
Then comes ~/emacs/emacro/e-configure.el, which generates
preferences/preferences.el as necessary, checking your PATH environment
variable, and elisp libraries in the load-path.
<br />
The remaining files are loaded in no particular order. If tiny-tools are in the
load-path, then they may not load, until the idle timer detects no keyboard
activity for several seconds.
<br />
Lastly, files loaded are from the preferences directory, including the
defcustom files, where preferences from the <code>M-x customize</code> or
associated pulldown menu are saved. The final file loaded is
~/emacs/preferences/e-postload.el, which contains user code.
<br />
Note that e-preload.el and e-postload.el serve a similar purpose, and are
loaded before or after the bulk of <span class="emacro">EMacro</span>,
respectively.
