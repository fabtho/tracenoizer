WHAT'S NEW IN THIS RELEASE (see also Upgrades in Install.html)
<br />
These recent versions have been tested:
</p>
<table border="0">
<tr>
<td>Gnu Emacs</td>
<td>v21.2
 <small>Mac OS X works, but Emacs-on-aqua is not supported.</small></td>
<td>v20.6 or higher recommended</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top">[Gnu] XEmacs</td>
<td>v21.4
<small>Mac OS XEmacs is not supported.
<br /> Beta GTk XEmacs had limited testing.</small></td>
<td valign="top">v21.1.9 or higher recommended</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
Note that XEmacs v21.4 changes ~/.emacs to ~/.xemacs/init.el
<br />
I recommend installing <span class="emacro">EMacro</span> Libs.
<br />
Classic Mac OS v8-9.x may still work, but is no longer being tested.
</p>
<h2>Annoyance Bugs</h2>
<p>
I have seen on a Microsoft Windows 2000 server, where
<span class="emacro">EMacro</span> will lock up, with the first file you try to
save. You can continue, by hitting <code>C-g</code> and future saves work
normally. This also does not affect most Windows systems.
</p><p>
Newer web browsers have been released, since EMacro started supporting them.
I need help from the community, in order to support new browsers, such as the
Mac OS X browsers.
</p><p>
Because browse-url under Emacs and XEmacs behaves differently, as well as a
small bug, launching Netscape compatible browsers displays the message
"Starting Netscape", even though it correctly launches Mozilla, Galeon,
Firebird, or other Mozilla derived browsers.
Nobody has been bothered enough to email me about this, so far.
</p><p>
There is a bug in which.el v0.44; it won't run <i>interactively</i>
under Gnu Emacs. EMacro uses which.el in <i>batch mode</i> (compiled), so
it works. Christoph Conrad, author of which.el, is aware of this problem.
</p><p>
When you start a search, C-s will continue searching, and will <b>not save</b>,
until you escape from the search. This happens even if you use an alternate
key-theme, such as CUA. Since I do not maintain the code for
<code>isearch-forward</code>(), this will not be fixed soon.
</p><p>
If you see <code>
(1) (error/warning) Error in `pre-command-hook' (setting hook to nil):</code>
in XEmacs, this is due to a bug in cua-mode.el
</p>
