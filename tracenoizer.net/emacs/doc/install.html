<h2><a name="Quick">Quick Start</a></h2>
<h3>Package Install</h3>
<p>
The emacro*.exe for Microsoft Windows needs no outside help. The
<span class="emacro">EMacro</span> packages for Linux-compatible systems
install into <code>/etc/skel</code>. Each existing user should run
<code>setuphome.sh</code> to copy <span class="emacro">EMacro</span> from
<code>/etc/skel</code> into their accounts. <code>setuprpm.sh</code> helps
install the rpm package. Cygwin users should be able to use the Slackware
package, but this has had little testing.
</p>
<h3>emacro*.tar.gz Install</h3>
<p>
Just as easy: extract emacro*.tar.gz to your $<i>HOME</i> directory.
MS Windows shell users run <code>%HOME%\emacs\bin\w32\e-install.bat</code>
<br />
Everyone else (including Cygwin) runs
<code>$HOME/emacs/bin/unix/install</code>. If you have Cygwin or similar 
Unix-like shell for MS Windows, this script is preferred to the DOS batch file.
<br />
The above simply rename(s) <code>~/init.el</code> to <code>~/.emacs</code>
<br />
Note the leading <i>dot</i> preceding <code>.emacs</code>
<br />
If you are new to Emacs keybindings, grab cua.el from <a href="emacs.html">
emacs.html</a> and put it in the <code>~/emacs/packages/</code> directory,
before starting Emacs with <span class="emacro">EMacro</span>.
<br />
Still having problems? See the <a href="#Detailed">Detailed Install</a>.
</p>
<hr />
<h2><a name="Upgrade">Upgrade Essentials</a></h2>
<p>
If you are upgrading an existing <b>.emacs</b>, you will move your code into
<code>~/emacs/e-postload.el</code>
<br />
You can also move code into <code>e-preload.el</code>, if it needs to execute
before <span class="emacro">EMacro</span>. Next, follow the <a
href="#Detailed">install directions</a>.
<br />
What follows are directions for upgrading an existing <span
class="emacro">EMacro</span> install. Be sure to backup your files! In
particular, you should save and re-use the following files in your [~/emacs/]
preferences directory. They are very much like user data. Older users may have
to rename files from another directory, which still work the same way.
</p>
<ul>
   <li>e-custom.el</li>
   <li>e-preload.el</li>
   <li>e-prefs.el</li>
   <li>e-postload.el</li>
   <li>e-xcustom.el</li>
</ul>
<p>You may also have changed</p>
<ul>
   <li>e-path.el</li>
</ul>
<p>
In other words, you will <i>likely</i> want to discard any new version of these
files, and overwrite them with your existing version. For preload.el and
postload.el, consider just making a call to your file:
</p><p>
&nbsp; <code>(load-file "/home/emacs/packages/myCode.el")</code>
</p>
<p>
Next, remove all bytecompiled elisp and cache files. This should do the trick:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>cd $HOME/emacs</code></li>
  <li><code>bin/unix/refresh</code></li>
  <li><code>bin/w32/refresh</code></li>
</ul>
<p>
Where <i>w32</i> is for Microsoft Operating Systems; <i>unix</i>, for any
other OS. These scripts simply remove ~/emacs/**/*.elc, and
~/emacs/preferences/e-*cache.el.
</p>
<p>
<span class="emacro">EMacro</span> contains much sample commented code, which
may solve your problems. Rather than simply uncommenting this code, consider
copying it to a file that e-postload.el invokes, which is there for user code,
not to be touched by upgrades. You could put code into e-postload.el directly,
but this prevents your code from accidental overwriting, when you unpack the
next upgrade.
</p>
<p>
Tools-&gt;Compare from the menu, or <code>M-x ediff</code> is a valuable tool,
to see what has changed in any file.
</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="System">System Requirements</a></h2>
<p>
<span class="emacro">EMacro</span> uses less than 2 Meg of disk space, and likely
even less RAM memory, in addition to Emacs or XEmacs's requirements.
</p>
<h3>If you use Microsoft Windows</h3>
<p>I recommend setting <code>%HOME%</code>. Otherwise, Emacs (or XEmacs)
generally considers <code>C:\</code> to be your home directory.</p>
<p>You will need tar &amp; gzip to extract the
<span class="emacro">EMacro</span> files. Cygwin has many useful tools,
including tar and gzip. It is available free from
<a href="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/">
http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/</a>.
After installing it, run the bash shell. Extract the archive with commands
like:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>cd</code></li>
  <li><code>tar -xzf <span class="emacro">EMacro</span>*.tar.gz</code></li>
</ul>
<p>There is also the <i>free</i> (GPL) <a href="http://www.7-zip.com/">7-zip
</a>.
<br />
There are other archive programs at no cost, but do not have <i>free</i>
licenses:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.filzip.com/en/index.html">FilZip</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.ultimatezip.com/">Ultimate Zip</a></li>
</ul>
<p>XEmacs users should also download the latest sumo tarball for
<a href="http://www.xemacs.org">XEmacs</a>.
</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="Detailed">Detailed Install</a></h2>
<p>
If you have a file named .emacs or _emacs in your HOME directory, you might
wish to rename it. If you successfully unpacked EMacro, you should have a file
called <b><code>$HOME/init.el</code></b>. Rename this
<b><code>.emacs</code></b>. Microsoft Windows also accepts the name <b><code>
_emacs</code></b>, if you have problems renaming it. If you had a previous
.emacs, you can move your code into <code>~/emacs/e-postload.el</code>
(preferred) or <code>~/emacs/e-preload.el</code>.
<br />
<i>Note!</i> <span class="emacro">EMacro</span> cannot support the code you add
to e-postload.el nor e-preload.el, nor its impact!
<br />
If you are upgrading, you should make backup copies of the following files in
the preferences directory:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>e-custom.el</li>
   <li>e-prefs.el</li>
   <li>e-xcustom.el</li>
</ul>
<p>You may also need to backup</p>
<ul>
   <li>e-path.el</li>
   <li>e-preload.el</li>
   <li>e-postload.el</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note that older versions of <span class="emacro">EMacro</span> had similar
files in other directories. You should be able to rename your old files to the
new names, and move them into the new directories (preferences), and be on your
way.
<br />
<span class="emacro">EMacro</span> works by searching your <code>PATH</code>
and your <code>load-path</code>, and caching the results. See the section on
<a href="#Configuration">Configuration</a> for details. <span class="emacro">
EMacro</span> also prompts you the first time, for things like your login name,
and saves these results into <code>~/emacs/preferences/e-prefs.el</code>
</p>

<hr />
<h3><a name="Required">Required System Information</a></h3>
<p>Be sure to have the following information available:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Server name for usenet news</li>
   <li>Usenet news login name</li>
   <li>Email address to send email from emacs</li>
   <li>Initial window height (preferred size on graphical screen)</li>
   <li>Printer and print server name</li>
   <li>Pop3 email receiving server name</li>
   <li>Smtp email sending server name</li>
   <li>Database hostname (i.e. SID)</li>
   <li>Database login name</li>
</ul>
<p>
PATH should be set with all <a href="#Supported Third Party Programs">Supported
Third Party Programs</a>, such as Netscape, so that <span class="emacro">
EMacro</span> can find them.
</p><p>
I recommend that you install the latest sumo tarball, if you use XEmacs.
Emacs, as a standard, ships with a complete set of elisp libraries, but this is
an issue with XEmacs, as it does not. <span class="emacro">EMacro</span> has
been tested with XEmacs standard distribution of almost no libraries. Testing
for missing libraries has become a maintenance nightmare, and
<span class="emacro">EMacro</span> may require the sumo tarball in the future.
</p><p>
<span class="emacro">EMacro</span> starts by prompting you for some values. If
you make a mistake, you can delete or edit preferences.el.
</p><p>
Note that there is a bug in the Mac OS port of Emacs <code>append-to-file()
</code>, that it will not create new files. You will have to create empty files
in <span class="emacro">EMacro</span>'s emacs/preferences folder (directory)
called
</p>
<ul>
<li>e-prefs.el</li>
<li>e-gcache.el (Emacs) or e-xcache.el (XEmacs)</li>
</ul>
<p>
Otherwise, remove *.elc and ?cache.el files, which you can do by
</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>cd $HOME/emacs</code></li>
  <li><code>./refresh</code></li>
</ul>
<p>
which simply removes ?cache.el and *.elc.
<br />
Bytecompiling is great for catching errors, but it also can cause problems,
when moving between Gnu Emacs and [Gnu] XEmacs, and different versions of
Emacs / XEmacs.
</p><p>
Be sure to check for any byte-compile messages.
You might also see a list of packages which will enhance emacs.
You can see the log of minibuffer messages with C-h l in XEmacs.
In Gnu Emacs you need to switch to *Messages* buffer.
</p><p>
If you have a good web connection, you can easily update Emacs.
Download and run
<a href="http://www.anc.ed.ac.uk/~stephen/emacs/ell.el">
http://www.anc.ed.ac.uk/~stephen/emacs/ell.el </a>
Restarting <span class="emacro">EMacro</span> will search for some of these
elisp macro libraries.
</p>

<hr />
<h3><a name="Tested">Tested Platforms</a></h3>
<p>
The following platforms have had some testing, with recent Emacs / XEmacs
versions. Be sure to check <a href="release_notes.html">release_notes.html</a>
for up-to-date configurations
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Free BSD (on AMD/Intel PCs)</li>
   <li>Linux (on AMD/Intel PCs)</li>
   <li>Mac OS (Classic) 8.x &amp; 9.x</li>
   <li>Mac OS X (terminal/console app)</li>
   <li>Microsoft Windows 9x/ME, NT v4, 2000</li>
   <li>Sun Solaris</li>
</ul>
<p>
Emacs v21 or higher is strongly recommended for Mac OS X. Mac Emacs and Emacs
On Aqua are not at full production quality, and have not their ports in synch
with recent releases. I recommend against these unsupported (by EMacro)
packages. See the <a href="#Mac">Mac OS</a> section for further caveats.<br />
Expect problems with xemacs-gtk (still beta), but should work adequately.
</p>

<hr />
<h3><a name="Description">Description</a></h3>
<p>
<span class="emacro">EMacro</span> should be the only startup file you will need
for any emacs. It also makes it easy for you to learn how to customize emacs.
You should also be able to tweak XEmacs without breaking GNU Emacs, 
and other combinations, such as a .emacs common to linux/windows dual boot.
<span class="emacro">EMacro</span> has been profiled for speed through caching
and lazy loading.
</p>
<p>
Be sure to back up your .emacs file. If you configure from the menu, emacs
writes to this file, and might cause problems. On MS Windows, the .emacs file
might also be called "_emacs". Windows users may have to use the command
prompt to rename the file to ".emacs". The default location on MS Windows is
"C:\ ", if the %HOME% variable does not point to a path. For MS Windows, or
unix like systems, you can check for the HOME environment variable by typing
<code>set</code> at the command line. For Unix, $HOME should already be set.
</p>
<p>
Put all the *.el files in your load-path (new downloads go into
~emacs/packages).
<br />
Put all third party support programs in your PATH. For example, MS Windows NT,
2000, ME users who want to use Internet Explorer support, should go into
Control Panel -&gt; System; MS Windows 95 and 98 users would edit autoexec.bat
to add <code>C:\Program Files\Plus!\Microsoft Internet</code> to PATH, in order
to launch Internet Explorer from Emacs.
You should change load-path.el to add all the directories where you keep *.el
elisp macro libraries.
On NT, launch the control panel, choose system -> environment.
For other MS Windows, put something like the following in your 
c:\autoexec.bat file:
<br />
<code>set HOME=C:\home</code>
Put .emacs in the directory set by environment variable HOME.
Create a subdirectory (folder) such as "/home/emacs", and put the remaining 
files there.
</p>
<p>
Setting the <code>%HOME%</code> environment variable will make your life
easy. However, if you don't, note that the precompiled binary for XEmacs
v21.1.10 uses <code>c:\users\default</code> for its default directory. We also
tested <span class="emacro">EMacro</span> without <code>%HOME%</code> set, by
putting .emacs there, and the remainder in <code>c:\emacs</code>.
</p>

<hr />
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<h3><a name="How">How <span class="emacro">EMacro</span> Works</a></h3>
<p>
Only the first time you start <span class="emacro">EMacro</span>, it asks you
some questions. See <a href="#Install">Install Questions Explained</a> for more
info. <span class="emacro">EMacro</span> is designed to work out of the box,
requiring no elisp programming. Be sure to run <code>e-refresh</code> to remove
<code>~/emacs/preferences/*cache.el</code> if you've run
<span class="emacro">EMacro</span> before.
</p>
<p>
<span class="emacro">EMacro</span>
tries to be smart, by searching for binaries in your <code>PATH</code>, and for
elisp libraries in your <code>load-path</code>
<br />
Since searching the load-path is slow, <span class="emacro">EMacro</span>
caches the results in either <code>~/emacs/preferences/e-cache.el</code>
(Emacs) or <code>~/emacs/preferences/e-xcache.el</code> (XEmacs). If you change
your elisp libraries, you should remove these files. This is what <code>
~/emacs/bin/unix/e-refresh</code> or <code>~/emacs/bin/w32/e-refresh.bat</code>
do(es).
</p>
<p>
<span class="emacro">EMacro</span> lists elisp libraries in the *cache.el
files, which support "Plug &amp; Play". Just download these into the
<code>load-path </code>, such as the <code>~/emacs/packages/</code> directory,
then remove their listings from the cache file, (such as by running
<code>e-refresh</code>) and restart Emacs/XEmacs.
</p>
<p>
Note that listings in the cache are in no particular order, and may be freely
edited or deleted. If you run into problems, you should run <code>e-refresh
</code> before contacting us for help.
</p>

       </ul>
   </li>
</ul>

<hr />
<h3><a name="load-path">load-path</a></h3>
<p>
The <code>load-path</code> Emacs variable works just like the <code>PATH</code>
environment variable. Emacs cannot find <code>*.el</code> nor
<code>*.elc</code> elisp libraries, unless they are in a directory listed in
the load-path. You can inspect any Emacs variable, by typing
<br />
<code>C-h v</code><br />
<code>load-path</code>
<br />
You can simply put all your downloaded optional elisp libraries in
<code>~/emacs/packages/</code><br />
You might wish to edit <code>~/e-path.el</code> to add additional paths.
However, you can avoid this trivial, but optional elisp editing, by installing
Tiny-Path, part of <a href="http://tiny-tools.sf.net/"> Tiny-Tools</a> to
automatically build your load-path. Again, put this optional library in
<code>~/emacs/packages/</code>
<br />
One last issue: some packages, such as Tiny-Tools &amp; JDEE put their *.el
elisp libraries in a subdirectory named lisp. You should look at the source
code for <code>~/emacs/e-path.el</code>, to see how <span
class="emacro">EMacro</span> deals with these. Typically, <span
class="emacro">EMacro</span> expects you to create a link to these files. For
example, you would do
<br />
<code>ln -s ~/emacs/packages/emacs-tiny-tools-2002.0805/
~/emacs/tiny-tools/</code>
<br />
or
<br />
<code>ln -s ~/emacs/packages/jde-latest/ ~/emacs/jde/</code>
<br />
For Microsoft Windows users, you will have to rename the directories. <span
class="emacro">EMacro</span>'s e-path.el is currently coded to put
~/emacs/tiny-tools/lisp/*.el and ~/emacs/jde/lisp/*.el (as well as
~/emacs/packages/ into your load-path. However, you can change or add
appropriate paths to your load-path, by editing <code>~/emacs/e-path.el</code>
</p>

<hr />
<h3><a name="Configuration">Configuration</a></h3>
<p>
Be sure to set your PATH environment variable.
<span class="emacro">EMacro</span> will search it for support programs, such as
jikes, ghostscript and ispell.
</p>
<p>
"M-x" means Meta-x. The Meta key is usually 'Esc', and sometimes 'Alt' 
Be sure to try both left or right Alt keys.
You may find it easier to customize emacs via the menu
</p>
<table>
   <tr><td>Emacs older than v21</td><td>Help->Customize</td></tr>
   <tr><td>XEmacs and Emacs v21+</td><td>Options->Customize</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Else use the command &nbsp; <code>C-h C</code> or <code>M-x customize</code>
You can find where elisp macro packages are being loaded, by
</p>
<ul>
   <li><code>M-x locate-library RET package RET</code></li>
</ul>
<p>
Get the latest packages from [Gnu] XEmacs's menu: Options->Manage Packages.
Gnu Emacs also supports third party libraries from
<a href="http://www.anc.ed.ac.uk/~stephen/emacs/ell.html">
http://www.anc.ed.ac.uk/~stephen/emacs/ell.html</a>
See also <a href="./emacs.html"> emacs.html </a> in this distribution.
</p>
<p>
There is an optional small unix shell script called <b><code>e-edit</code></b>,
or for XEmacs, <b><code>e-xedit</code></b> which speeds up Emacs, when you run
a second (or more) copy, by attaching to an already running Emacs. You can
place it in your $PATH, as is, or replace the Emacs/XEmacs filesystem link with
this script. Be sure to edit the script, so that it calls the real Emacs, that
is, the file softlink <code>emacs</code> was pointing to.
</p>
<p>
Finally, <span class="emacro">EMacro</span> searches the Emacs variable <code>
load-path</code> for optional libraries. The results are written to
<code>~/emacs/preferences/e-cache.el</code> or <code>e-xcache.el</code>, if you
run XEmacs.
You should look at them to see which libraries you should download, to enhance
Emacs.
<br />
Example: You open <code>e-cache.el</code> in Emacs, and see the line
<br />
<code>(defconst cache-cua nil)	;For CUA key support, get cua.el from
&lt;url:http://www.cua.dk/cua.html&gt;</code>
<br />
You download <code>cua.el</code> into <code>~/emacs/packages/</code> (which is
in the load-path), and delete <code>e-cache.el</code>. <span class="emacro">
EMacro</span> rebuilds this cache when you restart Emacs, and now you can use
<code>C-c, C-x &amp; C-v</code> for copy, cut &amp; paste. (Note: cua.el does
not currently work with XEmacs)
</p>

<hr />
<h3><a name="Other">Other Configuration Files</a></h3>
<p>
Note that <b>~</b> = $<i>HOME</i>, the directory in your HOME environment
variable.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>/etc/hosts</b> [xemacs] - should have at least the following
    <br />
    <code>127.0.0.1 &nbsp; localhost</code>

    <br />
    <code>machine (newsServerName) login (myLoginName) password
    (myPassword)</code>
    <br />
    Then do `chmod 600 ~/.authinfo` to make it difficult to read your password

    </code>
    If you want to set To Do reminders, to fire a few days ahead, you will
    have to embed elisp code in ~/diary (assuming <code>diary-file</code> has
    its default value). Use<br />
    <code>C-h f</code><br />
    <code>diary-remind</code><br />
    for details. The format of the elisp statement to remember a week ahead, to
    get paid on the 15th of each month is<br />
    <code>%%(diary-remind '(diary-date t 15 2001) 7) Pick up check</code><br />

<h3><a name="Mac">Mac OS</a></h3>
<p>
Recent versions of Mac OS X XEmacs should work, but have not been tested.
</p>
<p>
Classic Mac OS (v8-9) users need to read the FAQ documentation, distributed
with the Mac OS port, in order to set environment variables. In particular, you
need to know how to set $HOME. The easiest solution is to put <span
class="emacro">EMacro</span> in the same <tt>mac</tt> folder as the executable
emacs application, itself, then rename init.el to .emacs
</p>
<p>
<span class="emacro">EMacro</span> will load, but not all parts of Mac Emacs
v21 are working. For example, start-process() has not been ported, so
(gnu)server and launching help from the menu will not work. You can, of course,
simply open your browser, yourself. 
</p><p>
Note that some of these features do work on the older Mac Emacs v20.6.
</p><p>Here are the steps to get <span class="emacro">EMacro</span> to load:
</p> 
<ol>
<li>(Re)Move server.el &amp; server.elc out of the lisp folder. These will not
work in the current Mac Emacs v21.1 port.</li>
<li>Create the following empty files in the preferences folder. Alternately,
you can put <b>;</b> comments in them:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>e-cache.el</li>
  <li>e-prefs.el</li>
</ul>
<p>
The first time <span class="emacro">EMacro</span> is run on Classic Mac OS
(v8-9), it will complain that it cannot run <code>ps</code>. This is expected
behavior that goes away, as <span class="emacro">EMacro</span> looks to its
cache on subsequent runs.
</p><p>
Currently, only Netscape is supported for launching <span class="emacro">
EMacro</span>'s html help files, for Classic Mac OS (v8-9). I
welcome contributions of applescript, to support other browsers.
</p>
<p>
Customize does not seem to work in Classic Mac Emacs v21.
</p>

<h3><a name="Install">The Install Questions Explained</a></h3>
<p>
Only the first time you start <span class="emacro">EMacro</span>, it asks you
some questions, and saves the results into <code>
~/emacs/preferences/e-prefs.el</code>. If you make a mistake, you can either
edit this file, delete it, or delete the lines that are wrong. Order of lines
in this file is not important.
</p>
<p>
Here are all the <i>possible</i> questions that you will asked, when starting
<span class="emacro">EMacro</span>. Note that
<span class="emacro">EMacro</span> tries to be smart, so you might <b> not see
all</b> these questions.
</p>
<ul><li>Do you want Emacs to access the internet?</li></ul>
<p>
If you use Emacs (hereafter includes XEmacs) to read email or NNTP news,
<span class="emacro">EMacro</span> will prompt to conveniently save your login,
and server info. You can still access the internet with Emacs, even if you say
<i>n</i>. However, this enables loading e-net.el, which helps automate remote
editing through EFS/Ange-FTP, or TRAMP and SSH connections, browsing html
files, including EMacro help, telnet inside Emacs, and Watson, which lets you
click and net-search on phrases in an Emacs buffer.
</p>
<ul><li>Do you have fast access to the internet?</li></ul>
<p>
If you do have a modem, and you say <b>y</b>, this likely won't be much of an
aggravation. If you say <b>n</b>, the consequences follow.
<br />
<span class="emacro">EMacro</span> includes a function, where you can click on
text it recognizes as an URL, and can launch it. However, if you have a modem,
which goes through a long dialup process to connect to the internet, or you
have no net connection, say <b>n</b>. This also enables parsing of XML
documents, using remote DTDs. You can test this, by loading <code>
~/emacs/contrib/test.xml</code> which loads <code>
http://emacro.sf.net/dtd/test.dtd</code>. This requires additional elisp
libraries in your load-path, (put them in <code>~/emacs/packages/</code>, if
unsure), in particular <code>html-helper-mode.el, w3.el</code> and <code>
advice.el</code>
</p>
<ul><li>What's your login name?</li></ul>
<p>
This is the default to save you typing, when you are asked later, what your
email, NNTP news, and SQL login IDs are.
</p>
<ul><li>What's your full name?</li></ul>
<p>
This is what appears in your email header.
</p>
<ul><li>What's your network domain?</li></ul>
<p>
This is the a default, to save you typing. <span class="emacro">EMacro</span>
is hosted at <code>http://emacro.sourceforge.net</code> so its network domain
is <code>sourceforge.net</code>
</p>
<ul><li>What's your email address?</li></ul>
<p>
My email address (as an example) is <code>
<script type="text/javascript">
<!--
spamBlock("bingalls", "users.sf", "net");
// -->
</script>
</code>
If you still have problems with this one, contact your System Administrator, or
visit the store where you bought your computer from.
</p>
<ul><li>What's your smtp email sending server name?</li></ul>
<p>
You need this, so that Emacs can send email. You may need to contact your
System Administrator, or Internet Service Provider. Example values are <code>
smtp-server.YourDomain.com</code> or <code>mailserver.sourceforge.net</code>.
You might find these values in other email clients, which you might already
have working.
</p>
<ul><li>What's your pop3 email receiving server name?</li></ul>
<p>
Commonly, this is the same server name as for sending email. If you use IMAP
for receiving email, contact the author, so we can test and develop a solution
for you. Proprietary email systems, such as Microsoft Exchange are not
currently supported.
</p>
<ul><li>What's your nntp usenet news server name?</li></ul>
<p>
Not all systems have news servers. You may need to contact your System
Administrator or Internet Service Provider. Example values are <code>
nntp-server.foobar.com</code> or <code>newsserver.sourceforge.net</code>
</p>
<ul><li>What's your nntp usenet news login id?</li></ul>
<p>
Typically, this is the same as your <i>system</i> login ID, which is usually
the same as your email address, up to the <b>@</b> sign. Thus, my email address
is
<script type="text/javascript">
<!--
spamBlock("bingalls", "users.sf", "net");
// -->
</script>
<br />
My login ID would be <code>bingalls</code>
</p>
<ul><li>Print letter or a4 (metric) paper size?</li></ul>
<p>
The size of paper you load into your default printer.
Answer <b>letter</b> if you live in the USA or in the country sometimes known
as Burma. The rest of the world uses the metric <b>a4</b>. Read the
documentation for (ps-)print.el, for other sizes, such as legal or b4
</p>
<ul><li>What's your printer name?</li></ul>
<p>
This is the device name your plain text printer. Example values for unix are
<code>/dev/lp0</code> or <code>/dev/rp1</code>. Windows users can get their
properties from the printer control panel. Examples are <code>PRN</code> or
<code>//server/hplaser</code>
<br />
I recommend that Microsoft Windows users use forward slashes, as using native
backslashes need to be escaped, and become hard to understand.
</p>
<ul><li>What's your postscript printer name?</li></ul>
<p>
Commonly the same as your regular printer name. Just take the default, if you
don't have a postscript printer. If you have ghostscript in your <code>PATH
</code>, use the same name as your regular printer.
</p>
<ul><li>What is your print command?</li></ul>
<p>
Unsure Linux (and compatibles) users, can just accept the default.
Windows users should consider using
<a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a>. They can put <code>
~/emacs/contrib/lpr</code> in their <code>PATH</code>, or take a look at
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/windows/faq6.html#printing-emacs">
http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/windows/faq6.html#printing-emacs</a>
for help.
</p>
<ul><li>How many spaces should tabs indent code?</li></ul>
<p>
This is the default, when you hit <i>tab</i> in programming source code.
</p>
<ul><li>What brand SQL do you use?</li></ul>
<p>
EMacro detected <code>isql</code>(.exe) in your <code>PATH</code> but does not
know whether to provide support for Microsoft, Sybase or Borland's Interbase.
</p>
<ul><li>What is your database login ID?</li></ul>
<p>
Contact your Database Administrator. Typically, this is the same as your system
login ID, as above. Note that <span class="emacro">EMacro</span> currently
supports the following databases:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Oracle</li>
<li>Sybase SQL Server</li>
<li>Microsoft SQL Server</li>
<li>Borland Interbase</li>
<li>Mysql</li>
<li>PostgreSQL</li>
<li>Solid</li>
<li>Informix</li>
<li>Ingres</li>
</ul>

<p>
For your convenience, <span class="emacro">EMacro</span> allows you to store
the password to your database account in clear text. The EMacro team, nor its
affiliates are not responsible for such consequences, including data loss.
</p>
<ul><li>What is your database server host name?</li></ul>
<p>
This is the DNS name for the machine that is running your sql database. An
example is <code>sqlserver.sourceforge.net</code>
</p>
<ul><li>What is your database name on the server?</li></ul>
<p>
A database <i>system</i> might have multiple databases on its server. Example
names include
<br />
<code>accounting</code>
<br />
<code>sales</code>
<br />
<code>rosebud</code>
<br />
Contact your Database Administrator for more help.
</p>

<p>
<span class="emacro">EMacro</span> tries to automatically guess, and use your
full screen height, then saves the result in <code>
~/emacs/preferences/e-prefs.el</code> as <code>(setq use-height <i>24</i>)
</code>, where, instead of <i>24</i>, your actual screen height is used. If you
set this height to <b>0</b> (zero) instead, <span class="emacro">EMacro</span>
will always automatically guess your desktop height. On X Window systems, this
takes can delay startup by about 1 second, while
<span class="emacro">EMacro</span> checks for taskbars which take up desktop
space. Note further, that <span class="emacro">EMacro</span> assumes that
desktop taskbars are at the top or default bottom.
