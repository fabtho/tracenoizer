This doc will likely be removed when the next version of Red Hat becomes
available.

Building Emacs v21.1.x, from source code is much easier, than with previous
versions of Emacs. Likely the fastest and easiest means for RH 7.2, you will
also find the latest versions first in source code format.

Download Emacs from <url: http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html >
Latest betas are at <url: http://savannah.gnu.org/ >
	rpm -e emacs		#Removing old Emacs version may help
	tar -xzf emacs*.tar.gz
	cd emacs*
	./configure --help	#To change options like destination dir
	./configure
	make
	make install

One advantage to RPM packages, is that source code is not easy to uninstall.
Unfortunately, there are Linux users who feel that gcc v3.1 is not as stable as
gcc v2.9. I cannot take responsibility, if replacing glibc and binutils with
newer versions cause erratic behavior.
I personally have not had problems. Note that I upgraded these libraries on a
freshly installed copy of RH 7.2.

To
install the Emacs RPM, download the following packages from
<url: http://www.rpmfind.net/ >
	binutils-2.11.92.0.12-9.i386.rpm
	cpp-3.1-0.17.i386.rpm
	gcc-3.1-0.17.i386.rpm
	gcc-c++-3.1-0.17.i386.rpm
	gdb-5.1-3.i386.rpm
	gettext-0.10.40-4.i386.rpm
	glibc-2.2.90-3.i386.rpm
	glibc-common-2.2.90-3.i386.rpm
	glibc-devel-2.2.90-3.i386.rpm
	libpng-1.2.1-1.i386.rpm
	libgcc-3.1-0.17.i386.rpm
	libstdc++-3.1-0.17.i386.rpm
	libstdc++-devel-3.1-0.17.i386.rpm

	emacs-21.1-4.i386.rpm
	emacs-el-21.1-4.i386.rpm

I recommend removing older versions of these libraries for this complicated
install, as it helps identify clashes, and relieve dependencies. Example:
	rpm -e emacs

In general, you will want to Upgrade libraries:
	rpm -Uvh gettext-0.10.40-4.i386.rpm

However, you will likely need two copies of libpng:
	rpm -ivh libpng-1.2.1-1.i386.rpm
NOTE! This will prevent you from upgrading software that depends on libpng,
which is much. Red Carpet users, this means you! However, you can temporarily
remove Emacs and the new libpng, then reinstall, after an upgrade.


The only tricky step, is that you will have to upgrade all the glibc libraries
in the same command, i.e. simultaneously:
	rpm -Uvh binutils-2.11.92.0.12-9.i386.rpm glibc-2.2.90-3.i386.rpm \
		glibc-common-2.2.90-3.i386.rpm glibc-devel-2.2.90-3.i386.rpm

Emacs is the last library to be installed. The html pages at rpmfind.net help
show the order of dependency.
You can also use the graphical gnorpm program. However, glibc libraries should
be handled more delicately, as most programs and libraries depend on
them. Using the command line should give you better error reporting than
gnorpm.
