EMacro: Easily and portably configures the Emacs and/or XEmacs editing systems
Copyright © 1998-2003 Bruce Ingalls bingalls(at)users.sourceforge.net

If you have a .emacs file (other than EMacro's) in /etc/skel or $HOME, you
should move it before proceeding; it might be overwritten.

This install package will work properly, when installed after all Emacs and
XEmacs editors are installed, as they might also write /etc/skel/.emacs

This also works well, before creating user accounts. If user accounts have
already been created, then you must do
	cp -R /etc/skel/.emacs /etc/skel/emacs ~
to copy the extracted file and subdirectory into your $HOME path.

The script "emacrosetup.sh" does this same copy

I recommend that beginning users install cua.el from <url: http://www.cua.dk/ >
into ~/emacs/packages/ before starting EMacro.

When you restart emacs, EMacro caches your environment into one of the files in
~/emacs/preferences/.

~/emacs/bin/unix/e-refresh will remove the cache, so that you can add new
supported packages to ~/emacs/packages/ for EMacro to recognize. A list of
supported packages are generated in the cache files,
~/emacs/preferences/e-cache.el (emacs) or ~/emacs/preferences/e-cache.el
(xemacs).
