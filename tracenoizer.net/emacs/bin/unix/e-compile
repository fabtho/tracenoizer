# Syntax: compile foo.el bar.el *.el

# I recommend that you do *not* compile EMacro's *.el elisp files. You will not
# gain much speed, and will lose portablility between versions & Emacs/XEmacs.
# You can can easily byte-compile individual files, by opening them in Emacs,
# then choosing menu: Lisp->Compile. Some packages, such as Semantic, used by
# JDE, benefit from compiling multiple files. You can recognize them, because
# they include Makefiles. Assuming that Make is available on your system, you
# may still get errors, because dependent libraries, such as ELib are not in
# your load-path. This script simply adds EMacro's load-path
