#Gnu Emacs replacement front end.  NOT TESTED!
#You need to run Emacs with gnuserv.el (which is enabled in EMacro)
#If this cannot start a faster gnuclient session, then it starts a full Emacs
#session. Note that `C-x c` closes all sessions, so be sure to `C-x #`

#Warning! Calls to `emacs -nw` with xemacs as window in mixed client/server
#will lead to Emacs locking and/or crashing.

#You can also rename emacs, and substitute this script, to work like magic

emacsclient -n $*  >/dev/null 2>&1 || emacs $*
