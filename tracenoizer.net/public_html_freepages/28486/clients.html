<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" Through this market, Computer Development Systems began providing its services to the web development company Highlander Associates. In addition to providing services to Highlander Associates, CDS was able to also build a non-commercial sales base in hardware and software sales, as well as support. With this purchase, CDS began direct marketing to existing clients, creating additional cash flow and client buy-in. This effort attracted more business, and built stronger professional business relationships with our clients. Our web server administration, and website development skills enabled them to profit from a decrease in support issues, increased customer satisfaction, and ultimately additional web hosting contracts.">
