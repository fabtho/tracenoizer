 . We need to know the rules for representing an integer, string, or floating point number in a SOAP message so that we can exchange messages freely between languages and platforms. The serialization of data inside a SOAP message is referred to as encoding. As this section focuses on the payload of the message, the XML in the examples represents only a SOAP message payload and not a complete message. Encoding Style The ability to decide on a set of rules for representing data in a message is very important to the open nature of SOAP.</td>

 Calls BROADCAS, a utility that allows you send a system shutdown warning message to users, so that you can direct them to sign off. For example, if a user is editing a routine when SHUTDOWN is run, the changes may not be written. If the system is forced down, some of the data buffers may not be flushed to disk. If you are using transaction processing, incomplete transactions will automatically roll back during the next system start. By default you shutdown (or restart) immediately running a user a defined shutdown routine and without broadcasting a message.</td>
