 All of the agency web sites are undergoing review and redesign as necessary to ensure that they meet or exceed the requirements of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Furthermore, NRCS continues to work on making all web sites accessible. Thank you very much for your patience through this redesign process. If you have any comments or suggestions for improvement, please contact the webmaster of this page. .</td>

 We discuss the initial collection of system requirements and scheduling of efforts only to the extent to which they impact analysis. Similarly, we discuss situation-dependent implementation matters such as programming in particular languages, porting to different systems, and performing release management only with respect to general design issues. Also, while we devote considerable attention to the process of OO development, we do not often address the management of this or any software development process. In order to describe the behavior of a target system, we have to describe relevant parts of the immediate context forming the boundary of the system. Consequently, one may argue that the apparatus that we present in this book could be used for modeling nonsoftware aspects as well.</td>

 While Part II consists largely of OO Design Patterns, they are not phrased as such, mainly because this was written before now-common ideas about presenting, structuring and documenting patterns arose. While there are many things we'd do differently if we were rewriting this book, there are no current plans for a second edition. However, Dennis and Penlope have written a book on OO Development Process and Metrics, and Doug has written one on Concurrent Programming in Java. No, there are not postscript versions or any other copyable files available. If you want your own copy, you'll have to buy the book.</td>
