 While the book is mostly self-contained, people report that it does not serve as an introductory OO text. It helps to have had some previous exposure to basic OO concepts. However, it does not address many nuts-and-bolts issues surrounding the use of real OO languages, tools, and systems for distribution in part because so few of them (of appropriate production quality) were available at the time of writing. While Part II consists largely of OO Design Patterns, they are not phrased as such, mainly because this was written before now-common ideas about presenting, structuring and documenting patterns arose. While there are many things we'd do differently if we were rewriting this book, there are no current plans for a second edition.</td>
