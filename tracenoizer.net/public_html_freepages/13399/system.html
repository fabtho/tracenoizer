 Once at VNA, the documents were batched and routed for manual data entry into software programs designed for payroll, billing, and patient record keeping. Since data on these paper forms needed to be entered into several systems, it was not uncommon for three different people to handle the same document. The system would capture fields directly from the fax and export them to our billing and payroll databases. We could also use TELEform in scan mode, to include documents like lab reports in electronic clinical records. One is used primarily for payroll-related documents that are faxed into the office and one for non-payroll documents that are scanned onsite.</td>

 The Setup Wizard that accompanies VB is crude, though it usually can get the job done. However, if you're developing complex applications and want to create a good first impression, you need something more powerful and flexible than the built-in wizard. Wise Solutions' Wise Installation System 9 Professional covers all the bases. It creates "traditional" packages you can deploy to any Windows version from CE to 64-bit. Even though it's not an MSI system, it gives you the same features, such as automated repair of installed applications.</td>
