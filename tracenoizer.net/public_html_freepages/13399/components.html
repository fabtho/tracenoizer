 Custom Apps Todays Software Architechture If you are interested in our Custom Application Development Services, you probably want to know, in which Architecture we plan, develop and deploy your applications. That's why we provided the following Architecture Overview page. The Software Development Tools and Environment we use The Microsoft Visual Studio development system offers us developers the tools to succeed in the new world of components. The language of choice for most of our n-Tier development is Visual Basic. Classification of the development project In the past, multi tier architectures seemed to be no appropriate choice for small to mid size applications.</td>

A growing number of sites are dedicated to ASP development.</td>
