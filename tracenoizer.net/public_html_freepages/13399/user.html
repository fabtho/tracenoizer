 .drp file is a small text file that is generated whenever a Droplet application is downloaded onto a client desktop. It sits on the client-side and gives the end-user's Droplets Client essential information about the name of the application, the location of the server-side application logic, the location of skin parameters and the size of the application window. The DRP file is the only thing the Droplets Client needs to present a UI to its end-user. zip name Droplets Email title Droplets Email height 400 width 700 bgrgb 246,200,66 mainpaneloff true icondata 2800000020000000400000000100080000000000000400000 0008080000080808000c0dcc000f0caa600aa3f2a00ff3f2a 5f2a00555f2a00aa5f2a00ff5f2a00007f2a00557f2a00aa7 An example of a Droplets application .</td>

 For Citrix applications, the on-screen display is a bitmap rendition of the target application as generated by the Citrix server, which hosts all of the target application's logic. This precludes the use of software test automation tools that directly interact with a target application by interacting with its' on-screen control objects in runtime memory. CitraTest is a standalone Windows application whose image comparison and user input capabilities are included in the CitraTest function set, accessed from within a Microsoft Visual Basic 6 scripting environment. CitraTest's image verification approach enables a consistent and seamless approach to test scripting and test execution for applications running in the Citrix System's remote computing environment, as well as any Windows based operating system and development environment. CitraTest recognizes and evaluates the targeted Citrix application's response during test script playback by comparing the application's display to images stored in a user-created baseline.</td>
