 Script configuration files should be placed in a directory that isn't accessible from the Internet but is readable by the Web server. If a script needs database access then database passwords and other database information should be kept in the configuration files. Data files are files that CGI scripts use to hold data for presentation or collection. A guest book is an example of a script that collects form data for viewing. The data directories have read permission and write permission if necessary by the Web server, but are not viewable from the Internet.</td>

Dynamically created HTML is where the contents are generated on the fly on the server using a mechanism like CGI, ISAPI, or ASP. ADO is a set of ActiveX controls that provide programmatic access to Microsoft's latest underlying data access technologies. This is a defined set of interfaces that all data sources can implement through special drivers (or providers). The ever-increasing role and importance of the Internet in application development has also driven the design concepts of ADO.</td>

 Routing determination When the expense report (a message) is posted, the script can read message properties, determine where it should go next, and then update the state of the message. State verification If logic were implemented on the client, the workflow logic would travel with the message and would therefore reside only on individuals' computers. Data validation An application may need to control the completeness and correctness of items submitted, such as making sure that required properties are present. This is done best when data-validation logic is consolidated in a server script. Then, no matter what form recipients use to post or edit a workflow item, server logic can validate its data.</td>
