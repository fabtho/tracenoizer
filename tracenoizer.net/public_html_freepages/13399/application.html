 Even though this functionality is available in the ZEN 2 release, Daniel's tool will let you do it using ZEN 1. 1, so you can have this convenience before you are able to upgrade. Here I have two simple but hopefully effective solutions for associating applications delivered via the Application Launcher to workstations. Although ZENworks 2 adds sophisticated features for maintaining this task, there might be some people out there needing this function right now, until they can upgrade to ZEN 2. The script will be part of the Application Object itself.</td>

 In this event, you can simply create a new parameter name and assign it a value based on your DRP-generating script's logic. .drp file is a small text file that is generated whenever a Droplet application is downloaded onto a client desktop. It sits on the client-side and gives the end-user's Droplets Client essential information about the name of the application, the location of the server-side application logic, the location of skin parameters and the size of the application window. The DRP file is the only thing the Droplets Client needs to present a UI to its end-user.</td>
