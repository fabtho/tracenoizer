 But we think the results have been amply justified. What can be done to extricate the designer and ultimately his customer from this dismal predicament. No matter what anyone tells you, the fundamental tradeoffs engendered by this basic behavior of electrical filters cannot be entirely eliminated in any design. Such tradeoffs can be rendered benign, however, and that's where unconventional filter topologies must be sought. The filter topology that we utilize in all of our speaker systems is know as the Kaminsky fourth order series network.</td>
