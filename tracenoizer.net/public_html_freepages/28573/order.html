<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" The principles of theoretical ecologists can not predict and are not falsifiable, and thus, by implication, they are not confirmable and thus are devoid of scientific significance. After all, ecosystems never die; they just fade into other ecosystems. Accordingly, in order to predicate properties of ecosystems, we must have a classification scheme that allows us to determine when the object of study remains the same ecosystem even though its qualities change, and when an ecosystem of another time replaces it. This requirement is an important conceptual condition for doing ecology because otherwise crucial notions, such as resilience or stability, could not have any meaning. Ecology lacks "baselines," -- norms from which to assess deviations.">
