 "When customers take their Web site seriously, they want that brand-name recognition. They don't want the site hosted in someone's garage. But Livia was concerned about usi ng CyberGate for Web hosting. 95 monthly dial-up service and found himself "knocked off" too often for comfort.

 The first basis comes from the suggestion by Lee (1988) that operant psychologists give up their stimulus-response language and instead talk about means-to-reaching-ends-in-context. Instead of saying "The red light was a discriminative stimulus for a braking response, because in the past this response had been negatively reinforced by avoiding an accident (or ticket)," one might say "In the context of street intersection with heavy traffic, the braking action was a means of preventing an adverse consequence (end). " The language Lee proposes makes clear that operant psychology is concerned with human actions (operants) not with specific responses or specific acts. By use of such language, which is still technically correct within operant theory, the possibility of misinterpretation by cognitive psychologists is reduced. A second basis for integration is in the demonstration (contrary to the views of many cognitive psychologists) of how basic concepts and procedures from operant psychology can be shown to produce higher order cognitive processes.</td>
