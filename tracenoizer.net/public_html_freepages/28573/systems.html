 the idea that species live in integrated communities is a myth. Living nature is not equilibrial -- at least not on a scale that is relevant to the persistence of species. Nor do homeostatic systems such as Gaia buffer life on a relevant spaciotemporal scale. Current ecological thinking argues that nature at the level of local biotic assemblages has never been homeostatic. The principle of balance has been replaced with the principle of gradation -- a continuum of degrees of disturbance.</td>
