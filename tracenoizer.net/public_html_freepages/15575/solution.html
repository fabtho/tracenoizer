 . The problems are classified into grade levels from Grade 5 to Grade 12. THIS IS NOT A TEST, but a set of carefully selected problems which can help you improve your problem solving skills -if you try to carefully think about how you would solve each problem, and once you have found the solution, you make sure that you understand all parts of the solution. You can try any problem you like and if the problem is a little difficult you can get helpful hints by following the hints link.

 When you have completed the first layer, you can do nothing without breaking it up. So you break it, do something useful, then restore it. In a good solution you do something useful all the time. This layer is in the way of the solution, not a part of it. .</td>

 Keep track of the time it takes to execute this algorithm. (Computations may be done with a computer or calculator. Now use the Nearest - Neighbor algorithm to find a solution. Keep track of the time it takes to execute this algorithm. Compare the results and effort needed with the two algorithms.</td>
