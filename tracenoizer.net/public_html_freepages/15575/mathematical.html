 Petersburg, and Yuri Matiyasevich's book Hilbert's Tenth Problem. .Mathematical Problems of David Hilbert The Mathematical Problems of David Hilbert About Hilbert's address and his 23 mathematical problems Hilbert's address of 1900 to the International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris is perhaps the most influential speech ever given to mathematicians, given by a mathematician, or given about mathematics. In it, Hilbert outlined 23 major mathematical problems to be studied in the coming century. Some are broad, such as the axiomatization of physics (problem 6) and might never be considered completed.</td>

 The individual mathematician feels free to define his notions and set up his axioms as he pleases. But the question is will he get his fellow mathematician interested in the constructs of his imagination. We cannot help the feeling that certain mathematical structures which have evolved through the combined efforts of the mathematical community bear the stamp of a necessity not affected by the accidents of their historical birth. Everybody who looks at the spectacle of modern algebra will be struck by this complementarity of freedom and necessity. The Collection This page points to a collection of mathematical quotations culled from many sources.</td>
