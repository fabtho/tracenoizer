The concept of locating an ethanol production facility at a feedlot is the kind of South Dakota common sense that can help increase the use of renewable fuels in the United States and solve our nation's energy crunch. This ethanol plant will be powered by methane produced from animal waste in the feedlot and the cattle will be fed the bi-product from the corn used in making ethanol. The increased production of ethanol will help improve the farm economy, will provide a cleaner burning fuel, and will reduce our reliance on costly, foreign oil.</td>

 . Christine Matson Halverson fired a rifle all night to keep a hired gunman at bay after her brother, Matt Matson, was gunned down May 20, 1893. Historical accounts say the incident took place on Matt Matson's ranch 30 miles south of Chamberlain on the west side of the Missouri River. Both the gunman and the cattle rustler who hired him were brought to justice. And Hamilton, whose 34,000 acres of land include a ranch home in the Missouri River breaks not so many miles north of the family's old homestead, approaches economic development in South Dakota with a strong dose of realism that might owe something to family history.</td>
