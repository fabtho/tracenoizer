 The opportunities are arranged alphabetically by science fields. The production of this guide was commissioned by the Yale College Dean's Office and funded by The New England Consortium for Undergraduate Science Education (NECUSE). The Guide was prepared primarily for use by students at the NECUSE schools. A non-comprehensive listing of more recent undergraduate research opportunities may be found on the YSER (Yale Science and Engineering Research) site at at www. HOW TO USE THIS GUIDE Research opportunities are listed in the science sections.</td>
