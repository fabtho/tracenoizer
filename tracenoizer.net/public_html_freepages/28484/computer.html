Users can log on to any computer and have access to their own data and documents, their own preferences, and their own applications, without having to understand why it occurs. IntelliMirror Features This document is based on the common infrastructure that will allow you to learn about and evaluate these new features, and think about the manner in which you will use them in your organization. There are several ways an administrator can make data follow its user.</td>
