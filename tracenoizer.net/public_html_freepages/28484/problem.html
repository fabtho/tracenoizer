 . How To Report System Problems in CS Labs How To Report System Problems in CS Labs Department of Computing Science University of Alberta It is very important that you report problems in the labs when they occur. The labadmin people carry a pager, and leaving a message on the trouble number will page the system administrator on call so he or she can fix the problem. This assumes of course, that the problem doesn't keep you from using e-mail. If it does, you'd better use the trouble phone number above.</td>
