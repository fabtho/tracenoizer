<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" " I wish I could make this book a requirement for all people going into vocational ministry. This book gives more meat than most seminary classes --- that is why Spurgeon is one of my heroes. He gives such marvelous insight, wisdom, and nurture to his students (both students that lived under Spurgeon as well as his students today). If you are a pastor or lay minister, do not delay -- get this masterpiece. Other than his "Treasury of David" commentaries on the Psalms, this is triumphant work.">
