 The next Walkington Weekend will be held in Beverley and the village of Walkington from 27th to 29th April 2001. . The Walkington Society was founded in 1988, by Roderic Walkington, with the purpose of bringing together the relatively small number of people who possess the Walkington family name or who have a Walkington family connection. Roderic located the 150 Walkington households who had their names entered in the UK telephone directories and wrote to them all asking for expressions of interest. There was an enthusiastic response to that initial letter and the fairly informal Walkington Society was formed.</td>

 We were able to pick a date that will work for all of us and hopefully for other Cory members who can come. The Ramada Inn is in east of East Providence in Seekonk, Massachusetts near I-195 and 114. The Cory Family Society has lost a member very dear to our heart. Charlotte had a very active role as the genealogist for the Cory Family Society and as past President. This occupied an important part in her life, and she took great pride in her research and in the assistance she was able to provide to others seeking information on their ancestry.</td>

 net Barger Family History Society 1421 E Street - Suite 3 Lincoln, NE 68505 United States (Click on Village Image to see the Barger Group at Yahoo) . . The overwhelming amount of information provided by Barger Family History Society members and friends has become increasingly hard to manage. For now, all the information is stored on 3" x 5" cards and a shelf full of notebooks and hundreds of floppy disks. We will attempt to make all the information available on line once again.</td>
