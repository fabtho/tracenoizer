 We were able to pick a date that will work for all of us and hopefully for other Cory members who can come. The Ramada Inn is in east of East Providence in Seekonk, Massachusetts near I-195 and 114. The Cory Family Society has lost a member very dear to our heart. Charlotte had a very active role as the genealogist for the Cory Family Society and as past President. This occupied an important part in her life, and she took great pride in her research and in the assistance she was able to provide to others seeking information on their ancestry.</td>
