 This is because a search by last name only is not permitted unless you search within a single batch of records at a time or, at minimum, across the entire country (not even a single county let alone a town). If you have a rare name this might be OK but what if you are looking for Smith or Jones. It is on the former stage-coach road between the towns of Okehampton (about 12 km to the north) and Tavistock (about 9 km to the south). Plus an Index to the 1861 census for the Parish of St Mary Church. You are able to search for families, individuals or places that have been listed.</td>

 It stood on part of a 5,850 acre tract his father, John Rucker, patented in 1745. The church served its congregation until 1817, when the members moved to Ascension Church, in Amherst. Logs from the chapel were later used to construct a corn crib at Sweet Briar College, two miles north. These long (about 50 or 60 feet), double-ended vessels dominated the commercial traffic on the James River and other Southern upland waterways between the 1770s and 1840s. A dispute arose in 1821 when the Rucker brothers' heirs sought to patent the design.</td>
