<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" Tommy Guerrero and Gadget have most definitely done the latter, with Tommy running Real Skateboards and Gadget manning Function 8 Records respectively. They channel their love for their hometown into beautiful, jazzy hip-hop soundscapes full of samples and snippets of life on the edge of the West Coast in these our times. There's the raggamuffin intro from MC Litall Toney and a two part French rap from Selavie. To check it out plop it in your CD-ROM drive and double click on HYA (mac) or HYA.
