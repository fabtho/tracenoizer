com Three Card Poker Poker What It Takes To Win Stepping Up to the Table Poker Hands Poker Dictionary 7-Card Stud Omaha Omaha Hi-Low Hold 'Em Three-Card Poker Back to the beginning Professional poker player Derek Webb, a talented and ingenious Englishman, came up with the idea for this new game in the mid-l990s. In some way, it is a close relation to the ancient British game previously known as Brag. You may play your hand versus the hand of the dealer or you may wager that your hand will be a pair or better. There are two separate betting opportunities to be considered. On the table layout you'll see three betting spots located in front of each player.</td>

 Once the dealer stands, the hands are compared and the hand closest to 21 is paid. The simplest way to get exactly 21 is to hold an ace and either a face card or a ten. There are many ways of playing Blackjack, but our advice to everyone is to study the game, develop your own strategies, play error-free and consequently become a winner. You must always split Aces and 8's, no matter what the dealer's up card is. Always remember that when you play blackjack it's you against the dealer.</td>

 Bookmark us, so you can remember where you saw that Cribbage book. . Points are scored mainly for combinations of cards either occuring during the play or occuring in a player's hand or in the cards discarded before the play, which form the crib. The player cutting the lower card deals and has the first crib. The deal then alternates from hand to hand until the game is over.</td>
