 com) Exhaust Mode by Francois Dellacherie Development version At the moment, a group of people are working to improve the code. There is also a version by Paul Baxter, compiled under Microsoft VC available. Description The program dealer can be used to generate hands for partnerships bidding training or for generating statistics that can be used to design conventions, or win postmortems. The program reads the description from standard input, and writes results on standard output. In general the input specifies a condition and an action, and the program will generate a lot of hands, and if the condition is satisfied execute the action.</td>

 You are then dealt a hand of five cards, all of them dealt face up. The dealer also receives five cards; four dark cards dealt face down and one card face up. The player and the dealer compare hands formed from their five cards. If you wish to challenge the dealer, you must place a bet by pressing the BET button. When you receive a good hand, you naturally place a bet to challenge the dealer.</td>

 If this option is chosen, you cannot modify the other hand of the same side. If the seed is left blank, the generator will be seeded randomly by an outside source and the deals cannot be reproduced. See also my Bidding Practice Dealer for creating just two hands, and my article on Randomization Techniques if you are interested in how these programs work. ..</td>
