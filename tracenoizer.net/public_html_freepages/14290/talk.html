 Derek and Wendell are complete amateurs and fail to install the system properly. That evening the alarm goes off several times waking the family and bringing police to the door. When the alarm is finally disabled, Robert and Jerri talk about what happened and decide they can feel safe without a security device. Zaria is not nearly as taken with Daryl and tells her father she intends to break up with him. He believes that if Zaria spent more time with Daryl she would grow to like him.</td>
