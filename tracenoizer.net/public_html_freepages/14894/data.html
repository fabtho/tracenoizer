 When completed, the site will point users to a toolbox of common resources resident on computers at member organizations, provide assistance on routine use of GIS health maps in selected national disease control programs and provide a forum for development of GIS models to predict the health impacts of water development projects and climate variation. . A work plan was developed for research collaboration and data sharing, recruitment of new contributing researchers, and means of access of other medical scientists and national control program managers to GIS models that may be used for more effective control of snail-borne disease. When completed, the site will point users to a toolbox of common resources resident on computers at member organizations, provide assistance on routine use of GIS health maps in selected national disease control programs and provide a forum for development of GIS models to predict the health impacts of water development projects and climate variation. .</td>

 The Workshop offers an enhanced matrix programming environment that includes IMLPlus, an extension to the IML programming language that supports strongly typed variables, object-oriented programming, and the calling of user-defined functions. . has long developed software for data analysis, econometrics, operations research, and quality improvement. A staff of over 70 statisticians and operations research analysts develop state-of-the-art software that reflects new methodology and practice. Close proximity to major universities and Research Triangle Park promotes the regular interchange of ideas with both academic and industry colleagues.</td>
