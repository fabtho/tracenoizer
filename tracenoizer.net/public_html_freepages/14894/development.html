 This report assesses the experience since the first pilots began to be tracked, and draws out salient implications for the Bank and other actors in the development community. . Country Experience March 1999-July 2000 Comprehensive Development Framework Country Experience March 1999-July 2000 The Comprehensive Development Framework (CDF), piloted in eleven countries and West Bank and Gaza, was introduced by World Bank President Wolfensohn in January, 1999. Building on the lessons of development experience, the CDF seeks to enhance development effectiveness through coordinated support of country ownership of a well-defined development agenda. The CDF proposal stated that results from implementing the CDF in countries that embraced the idea would be assessed in 12-18 months time.</td>

 . A work plan was developed for research collaboration and data sharing, recruitment of new contributing researchers, and means of access of other medical scientists and national control program managers to GIS models that may be used for more effective control of snail-borne disease. When completed, the site will point users to a toolbox of common resources resident on computers at member organizations, provide assistance on routine use of GIS health maps in selected national disease control programs and provide a forum for development of GIS models to predict the health impacts of water development projects and climate variation. ..</td>

 The majority of the Network's research is conducted by Network members. . The network explores how knowledge of brain development can guide us in our understanding of behavioral development and vice versa. It focuses specifically on sensitive periods and neural plasticity, the reciprocal phenomena whereby (a) the brain is negatively affected if certain experiences fail to occur within a certain time period, and (b) the brain is altered by experience at virtually any point in the life span. Here we consider not only how the structure of experience is incorporated into the structure of the brain, but also how this knowledge can influence the decisions we make about intervening in the lives of children.</td>
