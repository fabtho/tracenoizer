 Volunteers are catalysts for change and are continually engaged in defining their role in response to the needs of their overseas community. Some applicants have degrees in social work, social services, counseling, or community development. Other relevant experience may be in adult education and teaching methodology, conducting needs assessments, and handling leadership responsibilities in clubs or organizations. Volunteers assist communities in developing programs to help these young people. Applicants can qualify with an associate's degree with one year full-time work, or with no degree and five years full-time experience.</td>

 . With the emergence of the open source movement, code for a wide range of software systems is now in abundance on the net. Such freely available source code embodies the collective experience of thousands of software developers all over the world from the past three decades. As a result, we now have a golden opportunity to learn from past software development experience through analysis of publicly available code in numerous open source projects. To this end, the CodeWeb project has been started to make this past experience easily accessible to software developers over the Web.</td>

 . The network explores how knowledge of brain development can guide us in our understanding of behavioral development and vice versa. It focuses specifically on sensitive periods and neural plasticity, the reciprocal phenomena whereby (a) the brain is negatively affected if certain experiences fail to occur within a certain time period, and (b) the brain is altered by experience at virtually any point in the life span. Here we consider not only how the structure of experience is incorporated into the structure of the brain, but also how this knowledge can influence the decisions we make about intervening in the lives of children. The majority of the Network's research is conducted by Network members.</td>
