 ) Sean's research efforts are focused on the role of geometric phases in sensing and control and mobile robotics. The ISR-affiliated Human Computer Interaction Laboratory is holding its 19th annual Symposium and Open House on Friday, May 31. The Institute for Systems Research develops, applies and teaches advanced methodologies of design and analysis to solve complex, hierarchical, heterogeneous and dynamic problems of engineering technology and systems for industry and government. ISR is a permanent institute of the University of Maryland, within the A. It is a National Science Foundation Engineering Research Center.</td>

 His research connects urban planning and traditional studies in architecture with the monitoring Internet traffic. As he pointed out, if we ever hope to learn from the wealth of knowledge being shared over the Internet, we need to start developing systems that can analyze traffic and generate meaningful data about to the type of communication taking place. As many of the panelists explained, in order to design systems that can facilitate dynamic understanding of data, our focus as information architects needs to shift from backend coding to an appreciation of digital aesthetics. What does it mean to have interstanding between ideas, instead of understanding of a singular concept. How does the interpretation of data and quality of information change in a digital environment.</td>
