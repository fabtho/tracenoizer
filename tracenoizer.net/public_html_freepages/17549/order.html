 During periods of increased volatility, you might suffer market losses in the price and share volume of a particular stock when systems problems result in an inability to place buy or sell orders. The risk of financial loss in trading online can be substantial; therefore, you should consider whether such trading is suitable for you in light of your circumstances and financial resources. In the event system capacity problems prevent our automated routing systems from sending your order(s) to designated market centers for execution, we encourage you to contact our Trading Desk for manual handling of your orders. We ask for your patience, during those times, because the Trading Desk will be experiencing heavy call volume. Please keep in mind that MB Trading takes significant measures to improve system capacity and reliability; however, you should have an alternate means of trading your securities including a back-up account at another securities brokerage firm.</td>
