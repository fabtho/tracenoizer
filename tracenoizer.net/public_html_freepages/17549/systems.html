 In most instances minor adjustment do not need to be formally controlled and the integrity of the process can be protected against failure by fixing critical standards including safety tollerances within the process. The sorts of processes that impact on product safety are those that require a reappraisal of the safety tollerances because they introduce new risk factors e. Inclusion of inherently risky ingredients Cooking Freezing and thawing Acidification Fermentation Drying Materials movement (cross contamination) Container closure Storage systems HACCP is the de facto standard for assessing food safety hazards and its principles can be applied to process development projects very effectively. Other risk assessment and design tools may also be useful and industry codes of practice provide a distilation of industry knowledge into clear understandable guidelines. For help with process control, equipment installation or process development issues send a message to john.</td>

 Thanks to Bob for kindly loaning us his really nice digital camera. I'm going to really miss it when I bring it back to him tomorrow. We talked for a while, drank coffee, copied some stuff between systems, and generally got our heads together. Angy showed up for breakfast, as she couldn't make it to the rest of the geekfest. Then we headed back to the house and the gaming got started.</td>
