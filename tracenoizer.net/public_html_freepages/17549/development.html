 In most instances minor adjustment do not need to be formally controlled and the integrity of the process can be protected against failure by fixing critical standards including safety tollerances within the process. The sorts of processes that impact on product safety are those that require a reappraisal of the safety tollerances because they introduce new risk factors e. Inclusion of inherently risky ingredients Cooking Freezing and thawing Acidification Fermentation Drying Materials movement (cross contamination) Container closure Storage systems HACCP is the de facto standard for assessing food safety hazards and its principles can be applied to process development projects very effectively. Other risk assessment and design tools may also be useful and industry codes of practice provide a distilation of industry knowledge into clear understandable guidelines. For help with process control, equipment installation or process development issues send a message to john.</td>

 The foundations of the national curricula of 1985 (LOPS 1985; POPS 1985) were already complemented by municipal curricula, although it was not until 1994 that the foundations of the curricula were intentionally based on municipal curricula. In the same way, the regulations on teaching practice have been loosened and the right of decision has been moved from the Ministry of Education down to universities and departments of teacher education. The emphasis on individualism can be said to be a megatrend characterising the expansion and development of the information society. In the domain of communications, the changeover from an industrial society to an information society means a switch from the hegemony of the mass media (monologic communication) to small group and target communication. Network culture is central to the National Strategy for Education (Committee Report 1993, 36).</td>

 Professor Johnson is a Fellow of the IEEE and member of the Acoustical Society of America, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the American Society for Engineering Education. Professor Johnson's present research activities focus on issues in statistical signal processing. Particular areas of interest are non-Gaussian signal processing, development of a theory of information processing (as opposed to signal processing) , and the transmission and extraction of information by neural signals (particularly in the auditory system). A curriculum vitae is available, including a list of recent publications. Such signals can be either be bothersome (noise) or information-bearing (discharges of single neurons).</td>
