When trading online, you should be aware that during periods of high internet traffic, you might experience delays in accessing account data due to systems capacity limitations. You may also experience system outages or delays as a result of, among other things, power failures, programming failures or heavy trading volume. During periods of increased volatility, you might suffer market losses in the price and share volume of a particular stock when systems problems result in an inability to place buy or sell orders. The risk of financial loss in trading online can be substantial; therefore, you should consider whether such trading is suitable for you in light of your circumstances and financial resources.">

 Chapter 3, 'The (almost) All-American Network' looks at the United States' historical influences on the Internet Protocol and on Internet 'culture'. I examine the Internet's development using two theories of contemporary American history, the consensus model and the organisational synthesis. However, I find both lacking in explanatory power because neither deals adequately with the international context of the Internet. In chapter 4, "IP on Everything" I look at the Internet in the 1990s, when it had grown beyond the borders of the United States. The Internet and Internet culture had transcended the 1980s problems of internal backbone politics and external competition, and connected people from almost every nation into a 'global civil society'.</td>

 But he could see that Powers was attempting to make a link, to something more contemporary. Powers, however, would not be rushed to his conclusion. "In the society of man this struggle is expressed through the struggle for power, for power can bring all these things. Power is the ability to control your own destiny, and the destiny of others. Power means never having to take abuse, but being able to dispense it liberally, all without fear of reprisal.</td>

 We have found ways of computing the Fourier and wavelet transforms of symbolic signals. Signal processing theory concerns the structure of the signals (it does not describe what they represent nor how well they represent it) and frames how systems affect signal components (not the how the system's actions affect what it conveys). Understanding power formed the basis of electrical engineering, and is well understood; understanding information representation and processing is far from complete. Shannon's work describes how to efficiently represent signals (whether they represent information or not) and how communication channels can reliably communicate digital signals. Our work considers the information rather than the signal, and we have quantified how well a signal codes information and how systems affect the information conveyed by their inputs.</td>
