 By doing this the already recorded Expression Controller events will be modulated insted of inserting new events. . Composing control change Composing control change Composing control change is way to quickly insert one or more control change events into a part. In Massiva it is possible to insert patterns of control change events, control change events can be faded from one value to another thru a part. Selecting what to compose Select the controller you want to compose from the Controller list.</td>

 This is intended to provide external, NAP, and National Academies' search engines with chapter-searchable text on a chapter-opening page. Do not use for reproduction, copying, pasting, or reading--exclusively for search engines. The evolution of control networks from monumented systems to a framework based on a continuously operated GPS reference system is inevitable. Although monuments are still needed in the near term to fulfill the needs of user groups such as the land surveying community, only a fraction of the existing monuments will be needed when these groups adopt GPS as a viable means for surveying. With fewer monuments to locate or install, CORS will be cost-effective.</td>

 Figure 1 shows a simple MIDI system, consisting of a MIDI keyboard controller and a MIDI sound module. Note that many MIDI keyboard instruments include both the keyboard controller and the MIDI sound module functions within the same unit. In these units, there is an internal link between the keyboard and the sound module which may be enabled or disabled by setting the "local control" function of the instrument to ON or OFF respectively. The single physical MIDI Channel is divided into 16 logical channels by the inclusion of a 4 bit Channel number within many of the MIDI messages. A musical instrument keyboard can generally be set to transmit on any one of the sixteen MIDI channels.</td>
