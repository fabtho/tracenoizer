 For help with process control, equipment installation or process development issues send a message to john. . In most instances minor adjustment do not need to be formally controlled and the integrity of the process can be protected against failure by fixing critical standards including safety tollerances within the process. The sorts of processes that impact on product safety are those that require a reappraisal of the safety tollerances because they introduce new risk factors e. Inclusion of inherently risky ingredients Cooking Freezing and thawing Acidification Fermentation Drying Materials movement (cross contamination) Container closure Storage systems HACCP is the de facto standard for assessing food safety hazards and its principles can be applied to process development projects very effectively.</td>

 Privilege claims should be extremely rare, given the protections already built into the Act and the age of the records. This approach recognizes the legal and practical reality that the Archivist must honor a privilege claim by an incumbent President. The time periods, however, would be modified to ensure compliance with deadlines imposed by subpoenas or other legal process. Also, the bill does not specify an outcome if the incumbent President claimed privilege in response to a congressional or judicial access request. Disputes between the incumbent president and either the Congress or the courts would be left for resolution on a case-by-case-basis.</td>

 3 The Net Metaphor When we discuss the networking learning environment, the metaphor of the net itself and the network is central (Tella 1994a). Its opposite can be seen to be the traditional tree of knowledge, whose trunk is thick and tall, branches dense and reaching towards the crown. The traditional view of knowledge and its development has been analogous to the process of climbing a tree. Everyone has to climb the same trunk, but then professional or disciplinary interest leads people to twigs more slender and farther apart. The tree model illustrates the acquisition of a wide general knowledge that takes years to achieve.</td>
