<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" The MIDI data output from a MIDI controller or sequencer is transmitted via the devices' MIDI OUT connector. The recipient of this MIDI data stream is commonly a MIDI sound generator or sound module, which will receive MIDI messages at its MIDI IN connector, and respond to these messages by playing sounds. Figure 1 shows a simple MIDI system, consisting of a MIDI keyboard controller and a MIDI sound module. Note that many MIDI keyboard instruments include both the keyboard controller and the MIDI sound module functions within the same unit. In these units, there is an internal link between the keyboard and the sound module which may be enabled or disabled by setting the "local control" function of the instrument to ON or OFF respectively.">

 . When trading online, you should be aware that during periods of high internet traffic, you might experience delays in accessing account data due to systems capacity limitations. You may also experience system outages or delays as a result of, among other things, power failures, programming failures or heavy trading volume. During periods of increased volatility, you might suffer market losses in the price and share volume of a particular stock when systems problems result in an inability to place buy or sell orders. The risk of financial loss in trading online can be substantial; therefore, you should consider whether such trading is suitable for you in light of your circumstances and financial resources.</td>

 Professor Johnson is a Fellow of the IEEE and member of the Acoustical Society of America, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the American Society for Engineering Education. Professor Johnson's present research activities focus on issues in statistical signal processing. Particular areas of interest are non-Gaussian signal processing, development of a theory of information processing (as opposed to signal processing) , and the transmission and extraction of information by neural signals (particularly in the auditory system). A curriculum vitae is available, including a list of recent publications. Such signals can be either be bothersome (noise) or information-bearing (discharges of single neurons).</td>
