 "Global Interior Project" Kunst Halle, Bonn, Germany. . fujihata Artist Statement The main goal of this collaborative project is to realize the ideal of the communication and media on the internet, which is developed not on the technology currently in use, as a subject to the revolution of our sense, and to operate the experimental project for realization of those potential ideas. Considering that the beauty formally has been produced by art is the history of each time's detection and is abstraction in terms of changing sense, and that the times now attaches too much importance on a technology, we need searching for the beauty not to re-produce the formal beauty by means of a technology but to point out an ideal method of relation between man and thing, man and man stated by a technology. Who is supporting and what kind of will and what kind of purpose are keeping the internet.</td>

 Learning and play are not contradictory, but rather are fundamentally related to each other. Humankind has created its culture by learning, enjoying, and analysing things in nature during its life in the world of nature. Mitchel Resnick of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Laboratory were invited to introduce their research that uses musical performances. Tod Machover is also a composer of music, and invented a computerized hyperinstrument augmenting musicality, performance techniques, and musical creativity. Renowned performers worldwide, such as Yo-Yo Ma, are using this hyperinstrument.</td>
