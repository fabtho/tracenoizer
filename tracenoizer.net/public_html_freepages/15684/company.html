 Sitting at the awards dinner on Thursday night during a particularly boring speech, we had time to read the track record of these awards, which looks like a corporate graveyard of Hong Kong, with a good measure of walking wounded. Remember names like Siu-Fung Ceramics, Peregrine Capital, Akai Holdings and PCCW. As we endured a particularly boring swansong speech on Thursday night by Mr Po Chung, founder of DHL International, who told us of all the awards that he and his company would have won if they had not been conflicted by sponsoring the awards in the first place, we couldn't help wishing that he had taken the awards anyway rather than give them to some of the budding corporate basket cases who have won in the past. The awards have been going 12 years now and, rather bravely, the organisers saw fit to remind us of the winners of the 1990-2000 awards in the centrefold of the evening's brochure. All the way through Mr Chung's speech, we couldn't stop laughing - we were thinking about how to write this article.</td>
