 In either case, the copyright remains with the original owner. Further exploitation of the work by the copyright holder can therefore take place without reference back to Education-line. Do papers in Education-line help with my Research Assessment Exercise rating. Whatever criteria are used in the next Research Assessment Exercise, it is unlikely that papers that have not been subject to formal peer review will be considered. It may, indeed, start to become one measure of good practice in research dissemination.</td>
