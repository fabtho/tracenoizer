 These increases were primarily due to an increase in the proportion of recipients who reduced their use of essential drugs. Reductions in the use of less essential drugs were not associated with an increase in risk of adverse events or ED visits. Dr Abrahamowitz participated in analysis and interpretation of data, drafting of manuscript, and critical revision of manuscript for important intellectual content, and provided statistical expertise. Ms Scott participated in analysis and interpretation of data and critical revision of manuscript for important intellectual content, and provided statistical expertise.

 Benchmarking provides an opportunity for learning and stimulates the application of new solutions and practices in research policies. It is a key element in the creation of a true European Research Area. The fifteen indicators presented in this document have been selected and defined together by Members States and the Commission whereas the data from national and international databases have been validated and completed by the Member States. Wherever possible, comparative indicators have been provided for the USA and Japan. .</td>
