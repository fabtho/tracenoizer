 Wherever possible, comparative indicators have been provided for the USA and Japan. . Key Figures 2001 - Special edition Indicators for benchmarking of national research policies The enclosed document presents the first set of indicators which have been collected as part of the first phase of the exercise of benchmarking of national research policies. Benchmarking in the context of national research policies is an instrument for increasing national performances through improved policy design and practices. Benchmarking provides an opportunity for learning and stimulates the application of new solutions and practices in research policies.</td>
