Reductions in the use of less essential drugs were not associated with an increase in risk of adverse events or ED visits.

 Service at RISD continues to change and develop in response to community opportunities and needs. The two strongest links flow from the departments that provide service connected to specific disciplines, and from the unique resource of the Museum. About 20 students participated in this experience this year. Furthermore, service-learning takes place at public housing sites and city elementary schools during and after school through the Community Art Program (CAP). CAP evolved from a request, made by the RI Attorney General's Office in 1989, to provide art instruction to at-risk children living in an environment rife with violence and substance abuse.</td>
