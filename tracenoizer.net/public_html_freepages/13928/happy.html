 I have been a fan of yours since 1969, and I have learned most of what I know about playing a guitar from listening to you and your associates. I was sitting in the THIRD ROW (talk about being spoiled forever), and was enthralled the whole time . Happy belated birthday, and I hope to censored that you have many more. Your a national treasure and the best singer songwriter and guitar player there is. (Bluebird, Johnnies Garden) Just an abstract thought, and more than likely a misinterpeted set of lyrics, but I have wondered about this for a long time.</td>
