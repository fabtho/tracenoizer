 I wish that you play a few dates in the western states or better yet come play in big sky. I very much wanted to try to get to one of these upcoming show back east. Open Up is basically the same lyrics, with a different tile and chorus, appearing on the REO 1973 release credited as just by Stephen Stills. The song can be found on Stephen Stills 2 This record was released in 1971. And I've seen you in the cities I've seen you on the road And your face is all a-twisted 'cause your brain is a heavy load And then you turn and ask me Say how will I ever know And you talk of all your searchin' But I think it's all for show Open up my friend Love someone if you can Go on, let her in Open up again.</td>
