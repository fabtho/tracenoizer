 I loved Amazonia, heard it live at Tanglewood in early 90's. then the "Stills Alone" got left in my car when I traded it in. All this talk about Eric Clapton and others being the best, I disagree and put Stills at the top of the bunch. Keep on rocking Steve and thanks for all of the great albums you've done and for all of the great albums that you are left to do. Despite unfair reviews by many 90's publications about CSN and CSNY's 1990's albums, I think those albums are great.</td>
