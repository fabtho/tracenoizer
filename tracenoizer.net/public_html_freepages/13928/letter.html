The rule will require all but the smallest auto companies to sell thousands of "zero emission" vehicles, or else face caps on how many gasoline-powered cars and trucks, including cash-cow SUVs, they are allowed to sell in the state. In 2003 alone, as many as 30,900 NEVs could hit the pavement in the Golden State, according to a state estimate - despite questions about the vehicles' safety and whether they will provide much environmental benefit.">
