 On the one hand you are a gret musician but on the other hand it would be grat to censored on your face and to kick your motherfuckin ass. I bought all your albums and there will never be a better Guitar Player and a Composer. by the way,when are you guys coming down here anyway. A friend took and album from a store 20-something years ago, and I got "good cop-bad copped" Of course it was "illegal Stills" Since y'all arent coming to Loosiana, I'm going to do my best to make it to see you in NYC or Denver.

 With a top speed of 65 mph, the vehicle will be legal for use on highways. . They are "neighborhood electric vehicles," or NEVs, and they are coming by the thousands to California, ground zero for the nation's car culture. The runabouts are basically souped-up golf carts, equipped with enough battery power to go as fast as 25 miles per hour - nearly twice as fast as traditional golf carts - and to cover a 30-mile range. Why is horsepower-happy Detroit so keen on rolling out these low-power contraptions.</td>
