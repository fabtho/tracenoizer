 According to someone familiar with its strategy, GM is negotiating to meet the mandate by buying regulatory credits from one of several start-up NEV makers. A likely candidate, this person says, is Lido Motor Co. , company whose founder is none other than Lee Iacocca, the former Chrysler Corp. NEVs can be recharged overnight with a traditional three-pronged, 110-volt outlet. A charge uses only about half the electricity that a refrigerator uses in a day -hardly enough, proponents say, to constitute an undue burden on California's straining utilities.</td>
