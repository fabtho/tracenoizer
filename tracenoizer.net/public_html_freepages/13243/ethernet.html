 LANs are typically limited to distances of less than 500 meters and provide low-cost, high-bandwidth networking capabilities within a small geographical area. . 10BaseT Ethernet is the most commonly used form of LAN. A piece of hardware called a hub serves as the common wiring point, enabling data to be sent from one machine to another over the network.
