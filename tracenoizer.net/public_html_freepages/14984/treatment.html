Specific areas of interest include regional cerebral blood flow abnormalities as measured by single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) in Alzheimer's disease. These abnormalities are examined for their diagnostic value as well as their responses to drug treatment.

3 million people diagnosed with breast, prostate and other cancers in the U. Clinicians at leading institutions are using a new technique called SmartBeam IMRT, that is showing promise of improving cure rates while reducing harmful side effects. Recent reports on prostate cancer patients show a near 70 percent improvement in treatment response using this method over traditional radiation therapy. IMRT has the potential to improve the treatment and cure rates for head and neck, pancreatic, lung and prostate cancers. In breast cancer cases, the technique makes it easier to deliver more consistent radiation doses and avoid the "hot spots" that can occur with conventional therapy by accounting for varying tissue thickness in the treatment area.</td>

 For full prescribing information on Viread, please call 1-800-GILEAD-5 (1-800-445-3235) or visit www. . Viread, a one-tablet, once-daily antiretroviral agent, received marketing approval in October 2001 for the treatment of HIV infection in the United States and was approved earlier this month in Europe. Study results presented this morning show that treatment with Viread was associated with a significant reduction in serum HBV DNA levels compared to placebo through 24 weeks of treatment and through 12 weeks in a second open-label study, both in patients co-infected with HIV and HBV. "Approximately 10 percent of HIV patients are co-infected with HBV, and treatment options that combat the hepatitis B virus are currently limited, with up to 50 percent of co-infected patients developing HBV resistance to lamivudine after two years," commented Dr.</td>
