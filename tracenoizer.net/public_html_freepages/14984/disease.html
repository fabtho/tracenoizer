 Furthermore, having genes known to confer susceptibility to celiac disease tripled the risk of developing the condition in the unaffected twin. . They suggest that more than one gene may be involved in the disease, with a series of genetic factors combining to produce gluten intolerance, rather than a single missing or faulty gene. In the largest study of its kind, Italian researchers studied 47 twin pairs, with one of each pair registered with the Italian Celiac Disease Association. The twins' zygosity was determined by DNA fingerprinting, and they were profiled for HLA class II DRB1 and DQB1 molecules.</td>

 Laudanum was sold as a patent medicine, and morphine was widely used by physicians to treat a number of ailments. It was logical, then, to think of abuse of these drugs a problem that physicians should solve (Berridge and Edwards, 1981). This change in perception of drug abuse from sin to disease led to the adoption of a new terminology. Toward the end of the 19th century, the temperance and antiopium social movements started using the term addiction to refer exclusively to the excessive use of drugs, and it replaced terms like intemperance and inebriety (Alexander and Schweighofer, 1988). The medical profession also adopted the term addiction and started using it as a diagnosis and an explanation of excessive drug use, thereby giving it the implication of a disease.</td>

 A 6-month investigation of this cluster of cases concluded with the recognition of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), which is caused by a hitherto unknown virus, subsequently isolated and named Sin Nombre Virus (SNV). HPS is now recognized as a pan-American zoonosis, with an expanding clinical spectrum, caused by many novel New World hantaviruses with distinct rodent hosts. Hantavirus Subject Menu HPS Case Definition Clinical Disease Manifestations of HPS Discusses the symptoms and development of the HPS syndrome and how clinicians may diagnose the disease. Presentation and First Evaluation Clinical Assessment Disease Development Differential Diagnosis Atypical Presentations Late Disease Development Radiologic findings Treatment Discusses treatment of HPS and outlines the rationale for suggested treatment options. Histopathology Explains the characteristic anatomical changes seen in HPS patients at the microscopic level.</td>
