 The Lao Women's Union was to have a vital role in implementing all three projects. The Thailand participants recognized the need to promote the role of women at the local level through training and through strategies such as increasing women's empowerment. They recommended that a national workshop be held to discuss a national policy on the involvement of women in the water resources sector since no concrete role for women had been proposed so far in developing a national policy and no clear mechanisms to link women's participation with the national water resources programme had been developed. They further recommended that the National Commission on Women's Affairs should hold a workshop to promote the role of women in water resources, and should undertake a pilot project in selected provinces to encourage women's participation in WSS. Since Phase I has been deemed a success, the report proposes the implementation of Phase II of the project in order to consolidate the findings and recommendations of Phase I for better strategies to promote the role and participation of women in the WSS sector throughout the region.</td>
