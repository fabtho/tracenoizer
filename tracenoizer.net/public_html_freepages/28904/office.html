 In no time, reports of bears roving through upstate New York began trickling in. And while a bear that wandered into downtown Albany, and was eventually killed June 15 by police, has made the biggest headlines, Central New York had its own recent bear scare. DEC's Region 8 office in Avon got the call and Officer Dieter Kramer was dispatched to the scene to confirm the sighting. "I got to within a 100 yards of it," Kramer replied when asked how he was sure it was a bear. It was a male that stood about 5-and-a-half feet tall and weighed about 250 pounds.</td>
