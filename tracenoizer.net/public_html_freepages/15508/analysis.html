 IGS -- International GPS Service Welcome to the International GPS Service Important IGS Format News Click here for the latest on new IGS site log, data, and data product formats The U. Global Positioning System (GPS) constellation of satellites plays a major role in regional and global studies of Earth. In the face of continued growth and diversification of GPS applications, the worldwide scientific community has made an effort to promote international standards for GPS data acquisition and analysis, and to deploy and operate a common, comprehensive global tracking system. The Global Data Centers archive and provide on-line access to tracking data and data products. The online data are employed by the Analysis Centers to create a range of products, which are then transmitted to the Global Data Centers for public use.</td>

 Our research has led to novel self-tuning components being included in Microsoft SQL Server. Developing rich modes of information access from data stores is the other central focus of our group. Traditional approaches to data reduction and analysis break down with massive data sets. Therefore, we aim at exploiting data mining techniques, i. , applying statistical and machine learning techniques to detect patterns in databases.</td>
