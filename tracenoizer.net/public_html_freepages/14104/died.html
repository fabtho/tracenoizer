 My grandparents Fred Baxter Arnold and Elzadie Crum (fathers side) and Murray James Glisson and Virgie Viola Smith ( mothers side) were also born in Alcorn County. My ancestors have been in this area for many years and I am trying to find as much information as possble about them. Wife name was Belle Blakely and she was born June 30,1860 and died January30,1931. They had eight children, their name is Roy Lee Davis Sr. If any information on any of these names, it would really be appreciated alot if I could get information on these people.</td>
