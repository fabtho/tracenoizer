 Checking a list of messages is typically a preliminary step to reading, deleting or other actions. Type a message sequence after the headers command to specify what messages you want to see. To remember what message sequences there are, type headers, a space, and a question mark. MM's message sequences make that less essential (although you can certainly keep multiple mail files and assign keywords if you find it helps you organize). USING THE RESULTS OF THE HEADERS COMMAND When the headers result matches what you want, use the message sequence previous-sequence, abbreviated p in the next command.</td>
