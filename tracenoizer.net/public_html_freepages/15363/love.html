 . Advertiser Subscriber Question I bought a painting recently at an antique store and on the back it had the title "Happiness Children" and numbers that appeared on the brown paper backing as if it had been through an auction. I know nothing about it but bought the piece because I fell in love with it. ..</td>

 But I'm pretty sure it's not a nice thing to see anyone be paired with 4 or 5 different men one after the other and none of the pairing is true or ligit. Unless the media is taking her fans for a ride or there is something I still don't understand about artistic creative career promoting. Does Pops handlers approve of all that media crap about love affairs she's not having. The things she stands for and represents to her good fans. But all this talk about something not there can undermine the things that are.</td>
