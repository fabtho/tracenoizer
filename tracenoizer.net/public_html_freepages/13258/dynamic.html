 85 Sorry--Windows Version is SOLD OUT To link to Consider a Spherical Cow by John Harte, click here. . The Dynamic Environment, Computer Models to Accompany Consider a Spherical Cow, Leonard Soltzberg The Dynamic Environment Computer Models to Accompany Consider a Spherical Cow Leonard J. Certainly this material could add some life and interest to high school or college chemistry courses. These computer models bring to life the environmental problems and case studies of John Harte's popular book, Consider a Spherical Cow.</td>

 Since 1993 he has been a postgraduate student in the LIFL, the subject of his PhD being a Generic Object-Oriented Dynamic Environment (GOODE) for cooperative applications using CORBA. . The Generic Object-Oriented Dynamic Environment project (GOODE) The Generic Object-Oriented Dynamic Environment project (GOODE) This work is part of the OSACA project of the computer science laboratory of the University of Lille. The name stands for "Open Software Architecture for Cooperative Applications". This project aims at building an open support environment for cooperative applications.</td>
