 Peter is looking into applications of virtual technology to help physically disabled persons. .au Reality envelops our most unconscious thoughts and conscious actions, it drives our most basic desires and needs. As we pursue our desires and needs, we socially construct our individual realities and the social reality. All other realities are finite and limited compared to the reality of everyday life.</td>

 These pages contain my own personal views based upon a lifetime of study that extends far beyond the realm of "vampires" alone. I can only present what I think, believe, and sometimes, know to be true. If you are offended by models of reality that differ from your own, please do not enter. If you are deeply invested in certain beliefs about what "vampires" are, or are not, and feel challenged or provoked when these beliefs are contradicted, you will probably be uncomfortable here. If all of that hasn't scared you off, and you have an open mind.</td>

 . These models are complex dynamic fields, which produce an exchange between virtual agents, poetic machines and interactive visitors. Knowbotic Research outlines technoid events parallel in real and virtual spaces to investigate the experience of the multiple layers of reality. The organization is based in Cologne at the Academy for Media Arts. With the partners of Westbank Industries and Tactile Technology Knowbotic Research has founded mem_brane, a laboratory for media strategies.</td>
