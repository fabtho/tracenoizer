 85 Sorry--Windows Version is SOLD OUT To link to Consider a Spherical Cow by John Harte, click here. . The Dynamic Environment, Computer Models to Accompany Consider a Spherical Cow, Leonard Soltzberg The Dynamic Environment Computer Models to Accompany Consider a Spherical Cow Leonard J. Certainly this material could add some life and interest to high school or college chemistry courses. These computer models bring to life the environmental problems and case studies of John Harte's popular book, Consider a Spherical Cow.</td>

 These models are complex dynamic fields which produce an exchange between virtual agents, poetic machines and interactive visitors. They enable an observer the physical exploration and construction of networked rules and strategies of the new public spheres. These extensions of the cultural environment provoke new cultural and aesthetical parameters in order to prevent an ideological closed circuit in an information based society. (Prix Ars Electronica 93, Golden Nica for Interactive Art; German Media Art Award, ZKM Karlsruhe 95). The installation Dialogue With The Knowbotic South will be on show at V2_Organisation during the Next 5 Minutes and can be visited daily between 12.</td>
