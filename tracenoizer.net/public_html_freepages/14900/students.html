 . Introduction For Faculty The REU Program supports REU Sites in all appropriate institutions (academic, non-profit, and private sector) and REU supplements in conjunction with existing NSF grants, as described in the Program Announcement. For Students The National Science Foundation makes possible a number of opportunities for undergraduates to join research projects each summer. This allows students to experience first-hand how basic research is carried out, and to contribute consequentially. The principal support by NSF of such activities is through the Research Experiences for Undergraduates Program.</td>

 ICE Week concludes with a celebratory lunch and party. . It offers students an excellent opportunity to develop group learning, time management, and presentation skills - essential qualities for effective job performance. Students work in pre-assigned teams to prepare a written analysis and summary of a series of case studies that draw on the collective knowledge they've gained from their first semester. Each team is selected to present one of these case studies before a review panel of Olin faculty and community business leaders.</td>
