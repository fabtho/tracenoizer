 . Introduction For Faculty The REU Program supports REU Sites in all appropriate institutions (academic, non-profit, and private sector) and REU supplements in conjunction with existing NSF grants, as described in the Program Announcement. For Students The National Science Foundation makes possible a number of opportunities for undergraduates to join research projects each summer. This allows students to experience first-hand how basic research is carried out, and to contribute consequentially. The principal support by NSF of such activities is through the Research Experiences for Undergraduates Program.</td>
