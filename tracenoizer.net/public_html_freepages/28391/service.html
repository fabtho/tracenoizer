 What have you got to lose, except maybe that paperclip. . By keeping our company small you can be assured of personal service by employees carefully recruited for trustworthiness, reliability, and attention to detail. That's why we pay special attention to details otherwise overlooked, such as baseboards, dirty light fixtures, dusty chair arms and bases. This is just a small example of the little things that make a big difference in the appearence of your building.</td>
