 This group of fourteen faculty and staff - including the chairs of the Staff and Faculty Senates and faculty specializing in organizational psychology - has met regularly for almost a year. While much of that time has been spent reviewing the university's current policies, members of the task force also developed and analyzed two surveys that were distributed to all university employees in April 2000. A second survey (PDF), soliciting general input through three open-ended questions, was sent to all other employees. These surveys were developed in an effort to gather the broadest possible input from the members of our community and to make sure that the task force's recommendations are consistent with what the community needs. While the information elicited from the surveys is important, it is not as important as the community-wide discussion that the task force hopes this research will prompt.</td>
