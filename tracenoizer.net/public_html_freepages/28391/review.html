 A telephone call to the adjuster may result in payment in this regard. However, on too many occasions, despite the fact that their insured had paid premiums for PIP coverage, insurance companies have recently begun to unilaterally decide to deny payment of further PIP benefits. The two other prominent excuses include (1) an examination by their doctor determined that further care would not be reasonable, related or necessary, and (2) reductions of charges after submission of bills to "medical review" companies who determine that the charges are not reasonable or necessary. Their failure to do so will result in interest penalties. There is no excuse for late payment by the insurance company.</td>
