 With the partners of Westbank Industries and Tactile Technology Knowbotic Research has founded mem_brane, a laboratory for media strategies. . These models are complex dynamic fields, which produce an exchange between virtual agents, poetic machines and interactive visitors. Knowbotic Research outlines technoid events parallel in real and virtual spaces to investigate the experience of the multiple layers of reality. The organization is based in Cologne at the Academy for Media Arts.</td>
