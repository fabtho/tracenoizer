 The data representations of the research subjects, data sets, models and simuations forming the -fictitious modifyable- objects of the knowbot, will only become visible within the architectural structure. . Antarctica Project DWTKS Dialogue With The Knowbotic South- strategies on a changing view of nature A dynamic map of a data-land-scape providing a form of interaction with multilocal and multipresent information-fields. These elements incorporate data sets of current antarctic research, which symbolize direct real-time links to the reference subjects occurring in scientific research and the underlying reference nature -in this case, natural events at the South Pole-. A spatial-interactive feature allows the user to 'immerse' himself into each knowbot.</td>
