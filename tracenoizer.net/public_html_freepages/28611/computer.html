 To fulfill this mission the library acquires, preserves and facilitates access to social science data resources, provides reference and technical services to researchers, and assists in the archiving of locally produced data. Surveys from the Roper Center for April are now available. ICPSR users can now download data directly on any computer that uses a UW-Madison IP address. The study also includes a sneak preview of DPLS' new look. Formerly only available in hard copy, this working paper supplements the datasets Roll of Emigrants to Liberia, 1820-1843 and Liberian Census Data, 1843 and is now online as a PDF document.</td>
