 A four-time Gold Glove winner, he's a big-time leader behind the dish and is excellent at blocking balls in the dirt. Charles has a quick release and an accurate arm which baserunners have come to respect over the years. A South Florida native, he returned to his original team when he signed with the Marlins after the 2000 season.

Charles began 2000 with the Baltimore Orioles before being traded to the Chicago White Sox on July 29.</td>
