 319 PT-MZD on short finals to runway 17R at Congonhas with the sprawl of only part of the city of Sao Paulo in the background. Previous 'Slides of the Week' SEARCH THE SITE WHAT THIS SITE IS ABOUT Aviation is the theme here, based mainly on the enthusiast side of what is obviously a huge genre - I have been an Aeroplane Spotter for 25 years, and have travelled all over the world to see and photograph aeroplanes. You can find all about Air NORTH within this site, indeed the society has had a web presence through my site, since the Autumn of 1995 - probably the first aviation enthusiast's society in the world to have a web site . My main task within the Air NORTH magazine is to compile and record the aviation movements at Newcastle Airport, and nearly all of my records in this respect are published within this site. These include the monthly visitors and airliners sections that appear in the Air NORTH magazine, as well as a daily diary of news for the enthusiast.</td>
