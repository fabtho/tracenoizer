We modify the idle, midrange, and full power circuits to maximize the performance at all throttle settings. Finally, we use top-of-the-line Creative Cycle Products adjustable idle mixture screws and brass fuel inlets. The greatest improvement per dollar can be found within the carburetor and air cleaner assembly. Maintaining velocity is critical when cylinder fill times are in the 100th of a second.">
