 Custom machining of stock Keihin CV carburetor optimizes fill-times and improves mixture velocity. We bore the throat of the CV to achieve the highest C. We modify the idle, midrange, and full power circuits to maximize the performance at all throttle settings. Finally, we use top-of-the-line Creative Cycle Products adjustable idle mixture screws and brass fuel inlets. The greatest improvement per dollar can be found within the carburetor and air cleaner assembly.</td>
