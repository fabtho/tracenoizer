 Managing change is itself a term that has at least two meanings. One meaning of managing change refers to the making of changes in a planned and managed or systematic fashion. The aim is to more effectively implement new methods and systems in an ongoing organization. The changes to be managed lie within and are controlled by the organization. Researchers and practitioners alike typically distinguish between a knee-jerk or reactive response and an anticipative or proactive response.</td>
