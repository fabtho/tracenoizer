 The paper then identifies certain institutional values that flow naturally from the mission statement and which, in turn, lead to the identification of certain core operational capacities essential to any future organizational structures or service delivery configurations. The goal is not to define the outcome in terms of specific organizational identities, relative responsibilities, and resource allocations, but instead to define a philosophical and values driven superstructure around which the operational decisions must be made. MISSION A statewide legal services delivery system must be designed to promote an articulated mission and corresponding vision of equal justice. The mission must be client focused and expansive, recognizing that equal justice contemplates more than simply providing a lawyer in every family law or unlawful detainer case. The mission must contemplate lawyering in its broadest sense, acknowledging that the interests of low income clients can only be served if the delivery system is dedicated to providing full and complete access to the civil justice system in a way that empowers this segment of the population to define, promote and defend its legitimate interests.</td>
