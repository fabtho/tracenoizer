 The purpose of this paper is to provide a framework against which this planning process might proceed. It articulates a mission that is driven by a vision of equal justice that empowers low income individuals and groups to define, promote and defend their legitimate interests through the civil justice system. The paper then identifies certain institutional values that flow naturally from the mission statement and which, in turn, lead to the identification of certain core operational capacities essential to any future organizational structures or service delivery configurations. The goal is not to define the outcome in terms of specific organizational identities, relative responsibilities, and resource allocations, but instead to define a philosophical and values driven superstructure around which the operational decisions must be made. MISSION A statewide legal services delivery system must be designed to promote an articulated mission and corresponding vision of equal justice.</td>
