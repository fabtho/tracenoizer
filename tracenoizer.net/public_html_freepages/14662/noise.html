 The broadcast networks are lunging in every copycat direction, too -- trying all the techniques that have worked on cable to combat audience erosion. The Web may intensify and accelerate this syndrome. By letting start-up and brand-extension marketers leapfrog traditional channels to get higher margins, the Web is expanding competition and increasing the noise level. The flaw beneath the surface of many site-based marketing attempts is the site's inability to identify and serve the core needs of consumers -- a company's brand differentiation gives way to standard site structure and price discounting. com can only set themselves apart and above by engineering a superior consumer experience at its site -- something neither company has done yet.</td>

 There are currently sections on VHF and above radio wave propagation, including educational material and a real-time aurora monitoring page; technical and operating information for VHF and above bands; some information about my past and present activities, and various other stuff. Much greater distances and other frequencies are possible in some cases. Noise figure, attenuators, VSWR calculations, and more. Download EME SNR Spreadsheet by AL7EB (based on original by DF9CY). Excel spreadsheet calculates system noise figurre, system sensitivity, and EME path signal to noise ratio.</td>
