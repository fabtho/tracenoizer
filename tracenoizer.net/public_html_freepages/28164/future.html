 " Doctors who treat adolescents deal with drug abuse almost as often as other pediatricians encounter ear infections; but Steve's LSD use was particularly troubling because, like many physicians, I had little experience recognizing or treating the problems that can result from it. As a matter of fact, LSD is again emerging as a serious concern to pediatricians and parents alike. According to the Monitoring the Future Study conducted by the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research, the rates of lifetime, annual and current use of LSD among 8th, 10th and 12th graders have gradually increased since 1990. Although LSD use reached its peak in 1996, during 1999, about 12 percent of American high school seniors used LSD at least once and more than 8 percent of them used it at least annually. More alarming, about 3 percent of these young adults tripped monthly.</td>
