 Each pair of adjoining rooms is decorated in the same patterns but in complementary color schemes. Interior Designer Fritz Kailer has been a member of the American Society of Interior Designers throughout his career. He has been the Executive Director of Eldorado Hotel's Design Department for the past two and a half years, but has worked with the hotel on and off since it opened in 1986.

His design experience prior to his relationship with Eldorado Hotel was primarily residential with some large commercial projects such as country clubs, model units for condominium complexes and hotels.</td>
