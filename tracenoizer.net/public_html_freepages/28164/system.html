 . The audit will produce a series of volumes, each examining a different aspect of Canadian democracy. This examination of the rules and processes that underpin the electoral system focuses on the arguments that have favoured or opposed changes in the electoral system; how the arguments and focus of the debate have changed over time and the extent to which they draw on concerns about inclusiveness, participation and responsiveness; and, the impact of the increased regionalisation of our party system on these debates. Does federalism enhance the prospect that governments will be more responsive to citizens than they would be in the absence of federalism. This study considers how much attention Canadians pay to politics, how involved they are in political life, how much they know about politics, and how committed they are to basic rights and freedoms both in principle and in practice.</td>
