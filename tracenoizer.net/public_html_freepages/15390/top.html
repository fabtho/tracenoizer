 Twin Discharge Classification System Latest innovation in air classification design. Twin rotor discharge allows higher RPM for a given feed rate or CFM requirement. Twin discharge allows smaller diameter rotor, there by increasing efficiency and top size cut. Easily replaces existing whizzer or cone separator. Premium Efficiency Cyclones Maximum particulate collection.</td>
