This included the establishment of the NERC Executive Board (NEB) and revision of the terms of reference of the Science and Technology Board (STB), which will be renamed the Science and Innovation Strategy Board (SISB). The role of the Resources and Strategy Group (RSG) will be absorbed into this new structure and so Council has approved the standing down of RSG. Council thanked RSG for its hardwork and the good advice it has provided over the years.</td>
