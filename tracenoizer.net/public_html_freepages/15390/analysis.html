 . The data provided by the Research Services Group is based on the bibliographic and citation information that ISI collects from its multidisciplinary database of thousands of influential, peer-reviewed journals. The Research Services Group maintains a file of publication and citation data spanning 1981 to 2001 that is specially structured in a relational database format for bibliometric analysis. It is multidisciplinary in scope and exhaustive in coverage of bibliographic information and citation counts (essential measures of research influence and impact). This database is an invaluable resource for science studies worldwide.</td>
