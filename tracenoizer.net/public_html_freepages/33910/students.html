 The UdK Berlin has established official relations with more than 100 partner schools abroad. Some partnerships are founded on bilateral agreements. The Office is also responsible for placing international students, artists and scholars with scholarships from the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD), the Fulbright Commission and the Office Franco-Allemand. The UdK is founding member of the European League of Institutes of the Arts (ELIA). German-language courses for students whose mother tongue is not German are given at no extra charge.</td>

 Existing permits can be extended four weeks before the expiry date. It takes approximately four to six weeks to obtain the extension. Note that students are not exempt from needing work permits, as they are in many countries, even if they want to work only part-time. EEA nationals and their spouses do not need a work permit to work in Austria, but should obtain an identity card called the Lichtbildausweis fuer Fremde. The card acts as a residence permit and it states on the card that you may work without a work permit.</td>

 What does the scene in which Shevek encounters the statue of Odo convey. What does Shevek's meeting with Rulag tell us about Odonian family life and gender roles. Chapter 5 What are the good and bad points of Shevek's students. How do they react to his decision not to give grades. It may seem bizarre that students are not allowed to marry, but this was a common rule in colleges on our planet not so long ago.</td>
