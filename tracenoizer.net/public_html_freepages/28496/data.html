 .1 Know the concepts of mean, median, and mode; compute and compare simple examples to show that they may differ. Using charts and other data, students will compute the mean, median, and mode. Students will compute mean, median, and mode on individual worksheets printed from Accelerated Math. Students will complete a variety of worksheets to practice these skills.</td>

 A brief overview of this is located on the student projects page. Students work through a series of steps to develop an experimental design, conduct an experiment and finally present their findings in a scientific presentation to the rest of their class. While undertaking this process, students are exposed to concepts such as symbiotic relationships and photosynthesis as well as scientific research skills such as data analysis and use of spreadsheets. The unit approaches the teaching of these concepts and skills from a constructivist standpoint. Students learn the objectives of the unit through self-directed investigations in pursuit of a successful experiment.</td>
