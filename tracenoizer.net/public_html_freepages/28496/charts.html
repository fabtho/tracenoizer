 .1 Know the concepts of mean, median, and mode; compute and compare simple examples to show that they may differ. Using charts and other data, students will compute the mean, median, and mode. Students will compute mean, median, and mode on individual worksheets printed from Accelerated Math. Students will complete a variety of worksheets to practice these skills.</td>
