 The RHESSI data center also contains a variety of active region and flare-related data. Annular solar eclipse of 2002 June 10 Fred Espenak's excellent eclipse site has new pages with information on the annular solar eclipse of 2002 June 10.

 A model based on n-ary relations, a normal form for data base relations, and the concept of a universal data sublanguage are introduced. In Section 2, certain operations on relations (other than logical inference) are discussed and applied to the problems of redundancy and consistency in the user's model. That's the abstract to "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks", a paper Codd wrote while working at IBM's San Jose research lab. It was published in the Communications of the ACM in June, 1970. Codd's paper is reprinted in Readings in Database Systems (Stonebraker and Hellerstein 1998; Morgan Kaufmann).</td>

 The projects and publications links below lead to fuller information about this and other work in the group. . Systems is the largest research area in the Computer Laboratory covering hardware, communications hardware and software, operating systems and distributed systems. Past systems developed here include Edsac, the Titan operating system, the Cambridge Ring and the Cambridge Distributed Computing System. The thrust is open distributed processing with an object orientated approach.</td>
