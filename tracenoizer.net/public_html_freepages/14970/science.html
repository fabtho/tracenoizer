 The plan includes goals for further improving sequencing technology; studying human genome sequence variation; developing technology for functional genomics; completing the Caenorhabditis elegans (now finished) and Drosophila melanogaster sequences and starting the mouse genome; studying the ELSI of genome research; studying bioinformatics and computation; and training genome scientists. The DOE Human Genome Program supports research projects at universities, the DOE Joint Genome Institute, DOE-owned national laboratories, and other research organizations. As part of the international Human Genome Project, vital and very active genome research also is being pursued by researchers and science funding agencies outside the United States. Information obtained as part of the HGP will dramatically change almost all biological and medical research and dwarf the catalog of current genetic knowledge. Both the methods and data developed through the project are likely to benefit investigations of many other genomes, including a large number of commercially important plants and animals.</td>
