<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" Lives and works in New York Cremaster 2 is part of a five-film series that has occupied Barney as writer, director, and actor since 1994. Although not one continuous narrative, the series revolves around issues of masculine prowess and transcendence. In each of the films, ritualized athletic endeavors and sexual transformations are emphasized. Episodes in the film present Harry Houdini (played by Mailer), reputed by family legend to be the illegitimate grandfather of Gilmore, as a perfect athlete capable of transcending physical limitations and escaping from any space. Barney exploits extraordinary and eccentric landscapes in Canada and Utah to advance plot and character.">

 This intermingling of sports and art informs his work as a sculptor and filmmaker. After graduating from Yale in 1991, Barney entered the art world to almost instant controversy and success. The title of the films refers to the muscle that raises and lowers the male reproductive system according to temperature, external stimulation, or fear. The films themselves are a grand mixture of history, autobiography, and mythology, an intensely private universe in which symbols and images are densely layered and interconnected. The resulting cosmology is both beautiful and complex.</td>
