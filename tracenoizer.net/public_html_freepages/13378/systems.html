 Data Flow Manager (DFM) is a tool to easily transform and move data from one data format to another. DFM can run stand-alone, as an Access database that manages the flow of data from one application format to another, or as an add-in to any Access database application. Almost every MS Access based desktop application that you develop has a requirement to communicate with other systems, big and small. Systems communicate through a cyclic process of data transfers. Yet, there is no tool available today that helps you do this in an efficient and elegant way, without having to build your own interface framework every time.</td>
