 . Both classical methods and more computationally expensive state-of-the-art predictive methods are included. The software kit has programs for (a) data preparation (b) data reduction or sampling and (c) prediction. Of special note are the advanced sampling techniques that can yield near-optimal predictive results for data mining. The potential business advantages of data mining are well documented in publications for executives and managers.</td>
