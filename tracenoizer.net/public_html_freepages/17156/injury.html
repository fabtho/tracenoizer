 Emyr Lewis returns to action after his neck injury against Edinburgh and captains the team, Cardiff's website reports. . His last full game was for the British Lions in Australia, where he picked up a knee injury. Jenkins made his comeback as a replacement for Cardiff on April 17 and also appeared briefly against Glasgow last week. He is one of eight changes in personnel, plus two positional changes, from the side that started against Swansea last Saturday.</td>

 Think of Jenkins and the image that springs to mind is that of a goalkicking colossus, a player on the verge of making his own piece of history. It is a virtual certainty that, during the World Cup, he will become the most prolific points scorer in international rugby union history. Barring injury or a calamitous collapse of national fortunes, he will also overtake Ieuan Evans as the most capped Welshman of all time. Currently he has 69 caps, three behind the great wing. All in all, not bad for a man who has had to deal with the slings and arrows aimed at him throughout his career.</td>
