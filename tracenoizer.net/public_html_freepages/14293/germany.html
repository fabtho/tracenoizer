Our intention is to provide an open forum in which three groups of geoscientists (field geologists, experimental rock analysts and numerical modelers), who traditionally have had only limited interaction, can disseminate their knowledge of fault zones and discuss how best to model them. We therefore encourage submission of talks and posters that will initiate such debate and knowledge transfer.">
