 Our intention is to provide an open forum in which three groups of geoscientists (field geologists, experimental rock analysts and numerical modelers), who traditionally have had only limited interaction, can disseminate their knowledge of fault zones and discuss how best to model them. We therefore encourage submission of talks and posters that will initiate such debate and knowledge transfer. For further information, please go to Workshop Homepage Contact Dr. Peter Connolly Geophysical Institute, Karlsruhe University Hertzstrasse 16, 76187 Karlsruhe Germany Fax. Birgit Mueller World Stress Map Project, Heidelberg Academy of Sciences and Humanities, Karlsruhe University Hertzstrasse 16, 76187 Karlsruhe Germany Fax.</td>

 Her lids fluttered open finally, just as he was beginning to worry anew. Without preamble, he snuffed the lantern, reached out, and pulled her to him as he reclined on the cot. Instead, she reached around him with the edges of the blanket, increasing the contact between them. "Nothing either of us are in any shape for at the moment. " He was thankful she couldn't see his face when he swore he heard her murmur, "Too bad.</td>

 Numerical calculations for the rotational symmetric Euler equations are presented. The results show a significant reduction in computational time. , finite volume schemes, are based on upwind techniques in order to handle shocks and contact discontinuities. In general, schemes of this type are very expensive. In 1993, Harten derived a concept to reduce the computational costs.</td>
