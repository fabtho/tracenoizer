 This set of images features comics from France to Italy and from Indonesia to Germany. For the future I plan to add more comics as they become available. As a fan of Japan, I am sad that there is no real translation of Carl Barks comics into Japanese. The only thing that exists is a Manga version of a few of his comics that have also be printed in other countries, including Denmark or Germany. It is time for Japanese children as well as adults to see the real Barks.</td>

Genesis Helix - Part 2 Alexbob9 Hey there, here's part two of Genesis Helix, hope you all enjoy. Genesis Helix - Part 3 AlexBob9 Hey there everyone, I've got part three up and ready for ya'll.</td>
