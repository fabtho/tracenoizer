 Although this site was intended for family and friends we welcome all and hope that you enjoy your visit. . This site was created for many purposes such as being able to share with and communicate easier with family members near and far. It was also a tool for helping my immediate family members to have a place on the net they could call their own giving them a chance to design and create their own pages. Tomorrow is coming fast and those who have the ability to function fully in an interlinked world will leave far behind those that do not.</td>
