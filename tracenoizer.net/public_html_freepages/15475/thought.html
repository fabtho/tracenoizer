<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" It had a huge serrated beak which it used to tear chunks out of its prey, according to Dr Steve Wroe, a mammalogist at the Australian Museum. The duck ruled the roost after the dinosaurs died out 15 million years ago and bit the dust itself 50,000 years ago, the New Scientist magazine says. Until recently it was thought the bird, weighing about 300kg - the same as a medium-sized bear - was a herbivore, using its giant beak to rip through branches and shells of nuts. But a specimen found in the Northern Territory, Australia, two years ago has provoked a rethink amongst academics. "I think there is little doubt now it was eating flesh," said Dr Wroe.">

 My ancestors James Hopkins and Philip Smell both served in the American Revolutionary War. Philip Smell was with Washington's Army at Valley Forge as a teamster. My Kyle line is thought to be from County Donegal in Ireland having migrated to Canada circa 1840. My McFarlane ties are from Scotland having migrated to Quebec in the 1830's and later Michigan around 1850.

 " Can you imagine having to go through things like this. Or the time when I felt so close to nature, and was full of such unbelievable emotion, and just when I finally broke down in tears, the skies opened and poured down an incredible hailstorm. Or the time when I had the most amazingly beautiful thought and suddenly the building was surrounded with crying seagulls. I was told in no uncertain terms by the Cosmos that the big bang was caused by emotion. And I was told that there is something that travels faster than light - it is thought.</td>

 Hired Gun Goblin Ive got a little Fallout story id like to send to you people, so here it is. Here is the Prologue, and chapters 1-4 of the full-length novelI'm writing. Originally I had thought that I would get it published, but ithas taken a bit more time than I'd like, and right now, I'm working onchapter 8. Anyway, I wanted to get this much up at least to get some feedback and see what people think of it. It is basically following about 20 years or so after the defeat of the Enclave, continuing the storyline forFallout 3.</td>
