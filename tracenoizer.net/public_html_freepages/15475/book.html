As an artist and book designer, Ellen Raskin supervised every aspect of the book's production, working very closely with the art director, Riki Levinson. Raskin took special care to make her novels readable and inviting to children by assuring there was a lot of white space on each page and by making certain that her books never got to be more than 200 pages long. The original first printing was completely shredded and the book was reprinted at the binder's expense.</td>

 Bell's encyclopedic work provides the rules and methods of play for 182 different games. Bells original two volumes published in 1960 and 1969 by Oxford University Press. Bell (1983) The Board Game Book ISBN 0-671-06030-9 Beautifully illustrated, coffee table sized book of board games. Most of the games are taken from Bell's earlier book but full color, page size examples of all the boards are given, as well. The Klutz Press book does a much better job of providing boards that you can actually use to play the games but this book covers many more obscure board games.</td>
