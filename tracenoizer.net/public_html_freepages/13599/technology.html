Her work often comments on the complicated responses our bodies undergo while interacting with technology, including the hazards of long-time exposure to electro-magnetic fields and the anxiety we experience when playing video games. Lucas's recent exhibitions include "Toys n' Noise," O. This interactive work presents virtual "waiting spaces" such as airport lounges, laundry rooms, and gas stations that replicate some of the frustrations and opportunities associated with using the web.</td>
