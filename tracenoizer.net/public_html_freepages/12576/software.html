<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" The GNU Project has spent the past 15 years developing a Unix-like operating system whose name is GNU. Over the years, various GNU programs have been ported to MS-DOS and MS-Windows. Now we have published a collection of these ports, and some other free software, with convenient installation facilities, on a CD-ROM that comes in a book. The GNU packages on the CD-ROM range from the versatile GNU shell Bash to a powerful text editor and programming environment (GNU Emacs) and a widely-used file-compression utility (Gzip). The second edition now includes GIMP, the GNU Image Manipulation Program.">

 . The operating system defines our computing experience. It's the first software we see when we turn on the computer, and the last software we see when the computer is turned off. It's the software that enables all the programs we use. The operating system organizes and controls the hardware on our desks and in our hands, yet most users can't say with any certainty precisely what it is that the operating system does.</td>
