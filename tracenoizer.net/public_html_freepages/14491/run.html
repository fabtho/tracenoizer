 Does not seem to extend himself if he sees that there is nothing there for him. Runs much better to the outside than to the inside. Will run a little tall and narrow-based on occasion. Does not have the great finishing speed to take it to the house and can be run down from behind. Has a good chance to start in the NFL and could start as a rookie if he improves his running between the tackles.</td>

 The same basic financial fundamentals that apply in 90 percent of businesses simply do not exist in sports. That's because sports owners, for the most part, are fans first and businessmen second. They built their fortunes one way but run their teams another way. They cling to certain players the same way Joe Six-Pack does. " That's why my favorite organization in sports is the Seattle Mariners.</td>

 Our philosophy is to work with the integrity of natural stone to enhance its spiritaul nature using sound craft practice. Shaun and Peter met four years ago and work as a team on major commissions, both public and private, through out England and Scotland. It is hoped to bring many commissions to the workshops, to run courses in stone carving, extablish training and work with people with disabilities. A particular interest by both artists in Celtic, Anglo-Saxon and Viking designs and styles of carving could lead, it is hoped to courses in carving these styles. Shaun, who has been appointed official sculpture to the Clan Sinclair, Caithness, explained that stone carving is presently greatly appreciated north of the border.</td>
