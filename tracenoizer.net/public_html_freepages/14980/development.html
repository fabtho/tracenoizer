 We are in the process of characterizing the efficacy of various formulations of a ragweed-CpG conjugate to prevent or reverse allergic asthma in a canine model of asthma. . Barrett's research is to understand the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms which mediate the genetic and environmental factors that contribute to the development and exacerbation of asthma. Three areas of research that are directed toward these goals include the contribution of ultrafine particles (air pollutants) in the development and exacerbation of asthma, maternal influence in asthma, and development of an asthma vaccine. Effects of Inhaled Ultrafine Particles on Asthma Epidemiological studies show that hospital admissions for asthma are positively associated with the concentrations of particulate matter (PM) in the air.</td>
