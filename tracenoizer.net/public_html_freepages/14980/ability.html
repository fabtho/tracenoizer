 The competition was judged by representatives from both universities and the event's sponsors Shell and Ford Australia. "The winning team has done a wonderful job," said Joanne Tyler, Manager of RMIT University Career Development and Employment. "It is a real reflection of RMIT University's goal to produce graduates with a real-world understanding of their areas and the ability to apply problem solving to a competition such as this. It is great for all the students from both universities to be involved in this junior think tank that will benefit not only the students but external parties as well in the future. " "Staff at RMIT University's Career Development and Employment unit and the University of Melbourne's Careers and Employer Liaison Unit must also be thanked for their tireless efforts over the past six weeks to ensure the success of the event," Ms Tyler said.</td>
