 In recent years, HRAP has expanded its work to include the encouragement of the rule of law and respect for basic standards of human rights by the Palestinian National Authority. This includes following the case of every student and staff member detained by the PNA. HRAP relies on the support and work of friends of the university all over the world. HRAP periodically launches international campaigns or issues special requests for action. We are always eager to have the involvement of the widest community possible.</td>

The Project was funded principally by the Academy of Finland and the University of Helsinki from 1986 to 1996. From January 1, 1997 to December 31, 2001, the Project was a Centre of Excellence of the University of Helsinki. Since January 1, 2002, the Project has had no source of funding.</td>
