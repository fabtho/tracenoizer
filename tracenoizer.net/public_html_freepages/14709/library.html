 For starters, this link takes you to a very basic Book History Timetable, part of the Book Information Website now maintained by Cor Knops; another site looks specifically at renaissance printing history. General introductory information about Your Old Books comes from a text originally written by the late Peter M. VanWingen (The Library of Congress) for people who (unexpectedly and without preparation) find themselves in possession of what appear to be old and unusual books and related materials. This is the current schedule for Penn's Workshop on the History of the Book (also called the Workshop on the History of Material Texts). Here is the website for the Washington Area Group for Print Culture Studies.</td>
