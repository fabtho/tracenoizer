 Deputy Director Kramer responded by saying the Division has a memo of understanding with the Forest Fire Service and the State Police, specifically regarding Incident Management. All three agencies are accepting each other's program because they are the same. There are 33,500 people in the certification system. In the Incident Management program, approximately 1500 have been certified at level 1, 71 at level 2, and 11 at level 3. The committee reviewing the Firefighter 1 certification program met.</td>

 In my view, the Kinetic is a gimmick, both technologically and from a marketing point of view. It is basically a quartz watch, whose timekeeping mechanism is identical to any present-day quartz watch. Its only innovation is the fact that it replaces the aspirin-sized (or smaller) battery with a much more bulky generating system and a very high grade capacitor for energy storage. The capacitor does hold a good bit of charge when fully charged (I think I heard 100 hours' worth of running time) but if you go away for a few days and leave the watch in a drawer, it is pretty sure it will no longer be running when you return. I suspect this is not a 60Hz circuit but something like a tape head demagnetizer that inductively charges the capacitor through a built-in rectifier circuit, by induction, the way some electric toothbrushes get their batteries charged without actual contact.</td>
