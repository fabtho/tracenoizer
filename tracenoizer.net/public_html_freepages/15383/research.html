 Married couples simultaneously choose the labor supply of the husband and wife and whether to participate in the Food Stamp Program. Using data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation, the author estimates a nested multinomial logit model. Simulations indicate smaller labor supply effects to changes in the food stamp benefit than the previous research which focused on single parents. Married-couple program participation is found to be relatively responsive to changes in food stamp benefits. The author is an assistant professor of economics at Hamilton College, New York.</td>

"Market research can establish beyond the shadow of a doubt that the egg is a sad and sorry product and that it obviously will not continue to sell. "A principle is not a principle until it costs you something. "Publicity is the life of this culture - in so far as without publicity capitalism could not survive - and at the same time publicity is its dream.</td>
