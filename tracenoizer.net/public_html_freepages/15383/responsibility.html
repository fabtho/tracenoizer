Wanting to make a strong entry in the United States, Seiko very cleverly supplied the initial shipments of parts free of charge to the company I worked for on the condition that we take the responsibility for keeping a required stock of spare parts for watchmakers. It was an awesome task just to sift through those unloaded huge craters of assorted watch parts marked with Japanese characters and part numbers. I was asked by my bosses to sort everything by calibers and assign parts envelopes with their corresponding part numbers prominently displayed so that any given part could be located at all times without waste of time.">
