 My personal involvement and connections with Seiko Time Corporation began in the late 1960's when, as a very young man, I watched Seiko establish itself in the United States first on the West Coast and then at Rockefeller Center in New York City. At the time, I worked for the leading watch parts distributor in the Northeast and one of my assignments was to organize and set up a parts inventory of Seiko watch parts. residents had no way of obtaining service for these watches as parts were simply not available. Wanting to make a strong entry in the United States, Seiko very cleverly supplied the initial shipments of parts free of charge to the company I worked for on the condition that we take the responsibility for keeping a required stock of spare parts for watchmakers. It was an awesome task just to sift through those unloaded huge craters of assorted watch parts marked with Japanese characters and part numbers.</td>
