 Its only innovation is the fact that it replaces the aspirin-sized (or smaller) battery with a much more bulky generating system and a very high grade capacitor for energy storage. The capacitor does hold a good bit of charge when fully charged (I think I heard 100 hours' worth of running time) but if you go away for a few days and leave the watch in a drawer, it is pretty sure it will no longer be running when you return. I suspect this is not a 60Hz circuit but something like a tape head demagnetizer that inductively charges the capacitor through a built-in rectifier circuit, by induction, the way some electric toothbrushes get their batteries charged without actual contact. So, is that a big advantage over the much slower mechanical winder. A manual winding watch can be given 24 or more hours' worth of running time in about 15 seconds.</td>

 Commissioner Schilling distributed copies of the survey. Commissioner Naylis asked if any work had been done on identifying potential cost. Commissioner Schilling asked if Commissioner Szczepaniak would be able to contact sprinkler installation and come back with some approximate cost. Commissioner Blohm said he thought the Division was going to hire consultants to take a sampling of high rise costs. Director Cane said Commissioner Blohm was correct but the first step was to complete the survey.</td>
