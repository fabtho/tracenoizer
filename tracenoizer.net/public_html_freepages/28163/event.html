 As young Jews try to piece their lives back together, many are dating more seriously and more frequently than before. Risemberg founded five years ago, had its best-attended Jewish singles night ever, he said. While last month's event drew 80 lonely hearts to the 92nd Street Y, a comprable event last year drew only 51, Mr. Date Bait, originally formed as a gay singles event, is a mixer divided into three parts. In the first part, everyone in the room spend a minute introducing themselves to the group.</td>

 Among the top women's riders will be Ina Teutenberg, No. 3 on the Pro Cycling Tour points standings this year. Not only is this a PCT points event, but the race is also one of four BMC Software Grand Prix races nationwide. Known for her finishing speed, Teutenberg represented Germany at the 2000 Olympics and has won the Tour de France Feminine championship twice. Earlier this season, she won the Sea Otter Classic in Monterey.</td>
