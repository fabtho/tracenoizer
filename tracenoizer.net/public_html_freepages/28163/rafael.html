 .Marin cycling fans can experience the Summer Games right in their backyard on Saturday, Sept. 8, when the San Rafael Women's Criterium rolls into town. This year's cycling extravaganza represents a dramatic increase in competition as part of the Pro Cycling Tour circuit. The race is also scheduled one day ahead of the San Francisco Grand Prix, featuring an appearance by three-time Tour de France champ Lance Armstrong.</td>

 Aberdeen Acres owner and DDADE founder Russ Ebersol said drug and explosive sniffing dogs are going to stay busy through the holidays. We were just going to be celebrating a little bit and sitting at home, so we rearranged our schedule and made time for it. The team left the area Wednesday and headed to San Rafael from Baltimore-Washington International Airport early this morning. Josie and Dublin are more interested in finding drugs and explosives and getting fed than they are with rubbing elbows or noses with celebrities. Each of a half dozen tents has a capacity of 5,000 to 6,000 people with lots of space here and there for more people.</td>
