 The team left the area Wednesday and headed to San Rafael from Baltimore-Washington International Airport early this morning. Josie and Dublin are more interested in finding drugs and explosives and getting fed than they are with rubbing elbows or noses with celebrities. Each of a half dozen tents has a capacity of 5,000 to 6,000 people with lots of space here and there for more people. A crowd of 40,000 to 65,000 is expected at the event, which runs until 4 a.
