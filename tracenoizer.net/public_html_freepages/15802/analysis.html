 . Consequently, this flexible and versatile platform is well suited for many types of proteins and has been used to develop a variety of assays in microarray format. Low inherent fluorescence of the substrate supports a variety of detection strategies compatible with multiplexed analysis and high throughput screening. For the full application note, please see the PDF version. .</td>
