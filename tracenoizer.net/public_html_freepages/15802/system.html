 Full Paper Click here for full paper (2602196 bytes, compressed using gzip). . Abstract The University of Massachusetts Ascender system relies on a single reconstruction strategy that is tuned to extract only one class of buildings by detecting single-level, flat, rectangular rooftops. The present paper describes initial work on a more general 3D reconstruction system that deos not rely on a single type of data, and is not restricted to a small predefined class of buildings. The approach involves multiple alternative detection and reconstruction strategies, invoked by clear contextual cues, that combine a wider set of algorithms and features for generating and fusing 3D and 3D information.</td>

 Boston Herald Runs Letter from TECO in Boston's Information Director Boston Herald Runs Letter from TECO in Boston's Information Director The Boston Herald ran a letter from TECO in Boston's Information Director Frank Wang on Friday, February 8th, 2002. Wang's letter expanded on an issue raised by Herald columnist Don Feder in a previous issue. Feder's column pointed out the many connections between Mainland China's military industrial system and the militaries of many countries that the U. Wang pointed out that it is Taiwan that faces the most immediate threat from the mainland, and cautioned that Mainland China may one-day use tactics similar to those that guide its relations with Taiwan in order to intimidate or coerce western democracies. .</td>
