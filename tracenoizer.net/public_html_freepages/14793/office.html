 This will give you an opportunity to quickly benchmark your own practice and future strategies in a quick and confidential manner. Benefits of Serviced Offices Serviced offices are now even more cost-effective for longer periods; for larger numbers of people and over a wider geographic spread, compared with five years ago, according to new CIPS research. In a new CIPS report entitled The True Cost of the Flexible Office, total occupancy cost savings achieved by using serviced offices have improved vastly since CIPS carried out a similar survey in 1996. The report, which compares the costs of serviced office space against the total occupancy costs of taking the same quality office space on a conventional lease, highlights that serviced space can provide worthwhile savings across a range of scenarios, even in high cost areas such as the City of London. "Our research clearly demonstrates that serviced office space has now become a truly cost effective option in all scenarios," comments Carolyn Munton, Director of Marketing and Communications, CIPS.</td>
