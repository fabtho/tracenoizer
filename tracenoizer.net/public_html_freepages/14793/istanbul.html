 There is a keen awareness of the ethical challenges facing domestic and multinational business in Turkey. The primary recommendation of the ERC report was to establish an independent nongovernmental organization to provide multinational corporations and local businesses in Turkey a range of services on business integrity issues. The first public step to raise awareness and garner support for the development of such an ethics center was a conference entitled Ethics Summit 2000, which was held in Istanbul on 17 October 2000. The conference brought international business integrity issues to the attention of Turkish business leaders, government officials and media. It addressed the benefits of fair worldwide business practices, the international conventions that support countries and businesses in the implementation of higher ethical standards and the importance of developing corporate ethics programs.</td>
