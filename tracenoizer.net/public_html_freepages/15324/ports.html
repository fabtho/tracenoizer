 This has prompted me to look even more closely at my firewalling. Although virtually every single service is commented out in inetd. conf, I still want to block and log any connect attempts to 'special' ports. By the way, the following are the high numbered ports that he tried to scan, have any ideas what they are used for. 5190 5191 5192 5193 5631 5632 5800 5900 8000 8010 8080 9100 25867 31787 33333 And finally, are there any other high numbered ports that you think could be potentially damaging (eg webmin - which port is that on).</td>
