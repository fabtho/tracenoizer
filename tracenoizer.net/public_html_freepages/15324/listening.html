 Is it generally considered safe to open up most high numbered ports. One last question - I keep on coming around to this one every so often. I am assuming that ICQ doesn't have a daemon or anything listening on every possible port, so how does it know when another ICQ user is trying to connect. How is this handled (how does the computer know whether ICQ should handle the connect attempt or whether it should be handled by some other process). .</td>
