Even if I'm not running that service, I would still like to know which ones pose a security threat so that I can block them anyway (in case I'm playing and start webmin, for example, without realilsing it). Is it generally considered safe to open up most high numbered ports. One last question - I keep on coming around to this one every so often. I am assuming that ICQ doesn't have a daemon or anything listening on every possible port, so how does it know when another ICQ user is trying to connect.</td>
