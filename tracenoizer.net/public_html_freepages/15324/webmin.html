 On what the system itself connects from shouldn't matter so much. . webmin is not listening on a port defined in some rfc, the port is specified during the installation process. I usually use port 900 (cause Samba is on port 901 by default. if there's no one to connect to your machine on the high ports it's safe to close them.</td>
