 webmin is not listening on a port defined in some rfc, the port is specified during the installation process. I usually use port 900 (cause Samba is on port 901 by default. if there's no one to connect to your machine on the high ports it's safe to close them. If the system is only serving mail and perhaps dns, you need only two or three ports. DNS might need a unpriviliged port for querying a dns root server.</td>

 1 We have access to our SAMBA server through WorkStations NT (NT 4. 0 with SP 5), and these stations must have WINS Primary Server address specified (NT stations connected on several sub-networks). With this mode, LOTUS failed to connect if a WINS Primary Server Address is specified. How can I configurate my SAMBA server to by-pass this problem . dat was always 3 hours in the future when saved by client B, when viewed from Network Neighborhood.</td>
