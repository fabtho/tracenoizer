 Reynolds is working on a book on the history and development of college composition. His project's name is "Implementing and Evaluating the Use of Computer Peripheral Equipment in the Entry Level Human Anatomy and Physiology Laboratory. " Briefly, students will use computer peripheral sensors, such as heart rate monitors, to collect and analyze data from their own bodies. An example is to measure their heart rates while lying prone, sitting up, and after doing a simple exercise. Data will be uploaded to the GC Web site via Apple's AirPort hardware and software, where it will be accessible anywhere students have Internet access.</td>
