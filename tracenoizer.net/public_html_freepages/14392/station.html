 . I'll tell you, after an eight-and-half-minute ride on a big rocket you feel really relieved to be in outer space. Luther Burbank School in Burbank, Illinois was the first to take part in the Amateur Radio International Space Station (ARISS) program. Rita Wright, Burbank's organizer Burbank teacher Rita Wright got word in August 2000 that the school had been accepted for a December radio contact with the crew aboard the Station. ARISS is sponsored by the American Radio Relay League (ARRL), NASA, and the Radio Amateur Satellite Corporation (AMSAT).</td>

 Although it was a relatively laid-back event, the team managed to log a fair amount of contacts. ARRL International Earth-Moon-Earth Competition On Saturday and Sunday, Nov. 10 and 11, we will be operating a 144 MHz moonbounce station from the club shack at Site 530. This is our second chance to test the abilities of the large 2 meter az-el array that members have knocked themselves out to get operational over the past two years. Gary Lauterbach has constructed a new huge 2 meter amplifier that should allow us to work more stations (last time there were a number of stations heard that could not quite copy us).</td>
