 . I'll tell you, after an eight-and-half-minute ride on a big rocket you feel really relieved to be in outer space. Luther Burbank School in Burbank, Illinois was the first to take part in the Amateur Radio International Space Station (ARISS) program. Rita Wright, Burbank's organizer Burbank teacher Rita Wright got word in August 2000 that the school had been accepted for a December radio contact with the crew aboard the Station. ARISS is sponsored by the American Radio Relay League (ARRL), NASA, and the Radio Amateur Satellite Corporation (AMSAT).</td>
