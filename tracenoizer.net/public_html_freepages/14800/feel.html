 And it's another way to tie The New Jazz Thing web site with The New Jazz Thing Live show. .can't you just feel the love in blog-land when Dave "Tell her she's irresistable" Winer and Doc ". business is love" Searls both emote that it's all you need. One of my favorite weekends of all was a trip to Santa Barbara that unbeknownst to us fell on parade weekend.</td>

 The video that is apparently catching people's attention shows a man killing a kitten, butchering it, and then cooking it. I haven't seen the video that's catching people's attention, and I don't plan to. To be honest, the idea of the video is making me feel very uneasy right now. I have seven cats of my own, and while I joke about them being sandwiches for a month (some of them are pretty fat) after a nuclear war, the idea of eating Lefty brings up the beginnings of a gag reflex. I refuse to be part of any lynch mob that goes after him.</td>
