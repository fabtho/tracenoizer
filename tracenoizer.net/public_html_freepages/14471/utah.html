 " - Artforum New York-based artist Matthew Barney's Cremaster 2 is the newly released fourth work in his series of operatic films and installations. Loosely based on the final events in the life of Gary Gilmore (played by Barney), Cremaster 2 pivots on Gilmore's link with his alleged grandfather Harry Houdini (played by Norman Mailer, who chronicled Gilmore's life in The Executioner's Song). Shot on location in the Columbia Icefield of Canada and the Utah Salt Flats, Cremaster 2 interweaves genealogical ties and geographic terrain to invoke Gilmore's doomed misunderstanding of what it means to be an escape artist. Zimmerman Film Series is made possible by a gift from The LINC Group, Inc. Additional support is provided by a grant from the Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund to the Stir It Up program and by a gift from Brad Smith and Don Davis.</td>
