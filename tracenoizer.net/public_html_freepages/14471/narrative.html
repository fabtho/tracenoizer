 The Spring Film Program features the latest installment of his epic project, Cremaster 5, which will be the final film in the completed series. Through a montage of imagery and symbolically related events, Barney constructs a sinuous and erotic form of cinema. The Cremaster series is an ambitious hybrid of video and film through which inventive forms of cinematic narrative are explored and epiphany is expressed. The films, while mysterious and often hermetic, are not arbitrary. Barney's attention to transformation as a subject links the processes of the athlete, the artist, and the alchemist to endurance spectacles of opera or sports--or to conflicts and differentiation of gender--with other sexual subjects revealing his creative obsessions.</td>
