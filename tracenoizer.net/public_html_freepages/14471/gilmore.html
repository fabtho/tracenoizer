 . The story unfolds in a series of stunning and surreal scenes that are narratively obscure and visually persuasive. The scene immediately preceding when Gilmore murders the gas station attendant and thus begins his infamous killing spree, has him parked in a shiny Mustang that is seamlessly connected to another Mustang by a tunnel linking the two cars. The tightly-corseted grandmother of Gilmore conducts a seance with her son and his fiance in which Gilmore is conceived to the buzzing of thousands of bees. That Gilmore was the first person to be executed in the United Sates after the reinstitution of the death penalty also contributes to the complex martyrdom (political and moral) with which both Barney and Mailer surround his death.</td>

 Deep inside the hive's heart, the six-sided shape of the honeycomb is echoed throughout the surfaces and architecture of the scene. Fay seems not to care that she is outside the laws of the hive, which mandate that only the queen may mate. Using her ectoplasmic phallus to assist, Fay facilitates Betty's fertilization so that she might bring forth a son, famed Utah murderer Gary Gilmore. The hive breaks open to reveal the explicit, clinical coupling of Frank and Betty Gilmore, surrounded by watchful drones and workers. In climax, Frank withdraws to show us his monster member, with its long shaft and beehive head.</td>
