 In 1989, he graduated from Yale University, New Haven. His singular vision foregrounds the physical rigors of sport and its erotic undercurrents to explore the limits of the body and sexuality. Broadcast on Dutch television and screened at several film festivals, Cremaster 4 (1994) and Cremaster 1 (1995) are the first two videos produced in a projected series of five that allegorize the stages in the sexual differentiation of an embryo. The Museum Boymans-van Beuningen, Rotterdam, organized a solo exhibition of his work that toured Europe throughout 1995 and 1996. Barney lives in New York and is currently at work on Cremaster 5, the third installment of his video cycle to be produced.</td>

 . Barney's allegory-making mindset will always have a jump on us. " - Artforum New York-based artist Matthew Barney's Cremaster 2 is the newly released fourth work in his series of operatic films and installations. Loosely based on the final events in the life of Gary Gilmore (played by Barney), Cremaster 2 pivots on Gilmore's link with his alleged grandfather Harry Houdini (played by Norman Mailer, who chronicled Gilmore's life in The Executioner's Song). Shot on location in the Columbia Icefield of Canada and the Utah Salt Flats, Cremaster 2 interweaves genealogical ties and geographic terrain to invoke Gilmore's doomed misunderstanding of what it means to be an escape artist.</td>
