Vlad grew up to be kind of warped, because when he was very young, his father gave him and his older brother Radu to the Turks as ransom. So, young Vlad was tortured quite often, and his childhood understandably made him quite bitter and he also hated the Turks more than anyone thought humanly possible.</td>

 . Contrary to popular belief he did not have pointy ears or unusually sharp teeth. Vlad Dracula is considered the base character in Bram Stoker's epic story Dracula. He was born in Schassburg (also Sighisoara), a town in Transylvania. His life was completely surrounded by war, barbarism, and extreme savagry.</td>
