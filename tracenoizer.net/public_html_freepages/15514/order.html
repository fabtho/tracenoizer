 Vlad routinely ordered a banquet table set up in front of his vidtims and would enjoy a leisurely supper amid the pitiful sights and sounds of dying. In addition to being known as an impaler, he was also known as Dracula which means "son of the dragon". Originally this title came about because his father (also named Vlad) belonged to the Order of the Dragon, an order formed by the Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund for the purpose of defeating the Turks. As his love for terror became more widely known, he was known as Dracul which meant "devil". He was regarded highly for his strong leading abilities and even though he had great ambition for politics, he was overthrown twice on account of his terrorism of the people.</td>

 He resided in Sighisoara, where toward the end of the year his second son, Vlad (later called Vlad the Impaler), was born. Shortly after the child's birth, it became known that Sigismund had select Vlad as his candidate to rule Wallachia. Vlad was invited to Nueremberg to be invested by the Order of the Dragon.

 The house in which he was born, still stands intact in Sighisoara. It was no castle, but just a simple three-storied house. He was named after his father Vlad Dracul, who belonged to the Order of the Dragon. This was an order formed by the Holy Roman Emperor for the purpose of defeating the Turks, who tried to conquer Europe at the time. His father ruled over the area of Southern Romania known as Wallachia, and to keep his power, he had to be allied with powerful people.</td>
