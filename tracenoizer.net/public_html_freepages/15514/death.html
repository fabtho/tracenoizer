 The first thing he did, was to build a stronghold for safety. With the help of several hundred noble families captured in his realm, who had to work as simple slaves, he got his stronghold build high up in the mountains, close to the northern Wallachian town of Tirgoviste. First he revenged his fathers death, then he got rid of all his enemies in a boundless carnage. Several thousand people was killed in Wallachia and the neighboring countries. But prince Dracula didn't just kill people, he liked to see them suffer.</td>

 For some war reasons, Vlad II sons had to spend time in Turkish prisons. Dracula was in prison between the ages of thirteen and seventeen. When he was realeased at his fathers death in 1448, he decided to make his father proud and continue with the war traditions. As prince and ruler of the country, he was in charge. He became known as Vlad the Impaler for his ways of inflicting agony and death.</td>

 His prisoners laboured under very difficult conditions for many months. Those who survived the gruelling ordeal were impaled. Impalement was an especially sadistic means of execution, as victims would suffer excruciating pain for hours, even days, until death came. It appears that Vlad was determined at times to administer it in ways that would ensure the longest possible period of suffering for the victim. While impalement was his punishment of choice, Vlad apparently employed other equally tortuous ways of dispensing with opponents.</td>
