 He finally claimed the throne after Hunyadi's death and a war with Vladislav II, during which Vlad killed the puppet-prince. He ruled for only 6 years, but victims of his vengeance are conservatively placed around 40,000. A prime example is the story of the building of his castle overlooking the Arges river. Vlad Dracul blamed the local nobles or boyars for the deaths of his father and brother. One Easter he invited all boyars and their families to dine with him at the palace.</td>

The author was a stage director, member in the Golden Down parapsychology association in London and a passionate researcher of Irish and Hindu vampirism. Royal Palace -Targoviste Bran Castle- Dracula's lair or was it . Too much is often made of this feudal fortress'association with Prince Vlad Tepes and hence with the imaginary vampire of Bram Stoker's Victorian model. In fact the castle's own towering strength, its narrow stone stairways, the relative smallness of its Lord's rooms and the cleverly authentic way it is furnished give an absorbing picture of how a noble family ruled this district in the 15th and 16th centuries.</td>
