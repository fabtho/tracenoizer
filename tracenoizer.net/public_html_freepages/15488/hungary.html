Dracula can literally be translated as "son of the devil. " (2) Wallachia was an independent province of Romania which was the subject of a constant power struggle between its powerful neighbors, Hungary and Turkey. Late 1436 Vlad II kills the seated prince and seizes the throne of Wallachia. Dracula begins his formal apprenticeship training for knighthood.</td>

 He regained it in 1443 with the help of the Turks, with whom he had signed a new alliance. The sultan doubted Dracul's loyalty, though, and demanded he leave two of his sons, Vlad and Radu in the sultan's court. Then, in 1444, Hungary led an attack against the Turks. Caught between his new alliance and Christian loyalties, Dracul only sent a small force to help the Hungarians who were soundly defeated. Following the defeat John Hunyadi, the governor of Hungary led an attack against Dracul and another of his sons, Mircea at Tirgoviste.</td>

 Vlad Dracul was the father of Vlad The Impaler Vlad Dracul was the father of Vlad The Impaler (1430 - 1477), the person who has been identified as the historical Dracula. He was the illegitimate son of Prince Mircea, the ruler of Wallachia, the area of present-day Romania south of the Carpathian Mountains. His Mother might have been Princess Mara of the Tomaj family of Hungary. He possibly spent a period of his youth at the court of Sigismund I of Luxembourg, the king of Hungary, as a token of faithfulness of Mircea's alliance with Sigismund. Thus, Vlad might have grown up in Buda and in locations in Germany.</td>
