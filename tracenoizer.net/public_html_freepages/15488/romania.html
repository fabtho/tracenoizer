 Tourism Minister Matei Dan told journalists the park - Dracula Land - would open in the summer of 2002, at an as yet undisclosed location, widely assumed to be in Transylvania. Many thrillers portray the bloodcurdling life of the Romanian hero Count Dracula is a Romanian national hero better known outside the country for the association with legends of bloodsucking vampires - as described by 19th century author Bram Stoker. Mr Dan dismissed criticism that the park would harm Romania's image. He said the proposal included plans for a Dracula Institute, consisting of several conference rooms and a library. Mr Dan said the institute would enable contact with about 4,000 Dracula clubs around the world, which would supply visitors to the park.</td>

 Wandering shepards in Transylvania ; The beautiful Carpathians This has always been a land of great controversy. To the Romanians, this was the heartland of ancient Dacia, whose fierce tribesmen first fought the Romans, and then intermarried with them after the Roman conquest to form what is today the Romanian race. Since the award of this land to Romania in 1920 under the terms of the Trianon Treaty, the treatment of minority Hungarians here has always been the constant source of tension between Hungary and Romania. With the downfall of communism, this tension has become more apparent, with nationalistic leaders on both sides demanding for extreme solutions to the problem. For a traveller from afar like me, the problems are apparent on the train to Romania - even before crossing the border.</td>
