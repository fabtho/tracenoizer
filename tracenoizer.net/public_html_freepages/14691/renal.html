 An international meeting on the podocyte, coordinated by Dr. Holzman, was held at the University of Michigan in September 2000. Frank Brosius has made significant strides in diabetic renal research, an area that intersects with the work being done by the podocyte group. Joel Weinberg has made major progress in the area of renal tubular injury. The caliber of basic science research, meetings, journal clubs, and training opportunities improves each year.</td>
