 . There have been no documented cases of such transmission in humans. Hopefully, with the research going on in these areas this will change.

 , published this study in the March 22 issue of the journal Science. . Research With Mice May Lead New Alzheimer's Disease Blood Test Research With Mice May Lead To New Alzheimer's Disease Blood Test Mice that were genetically altered to produce beta amyloid plaques, which are one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease, were injected with an antibody that caused a significant increase in blood levels of beta amyloid. The amount of the beta amyloid concentrations found in the blood where found to be highly correlated to the concentrations found in the brains of the mice. Although there are no guarantees that this technique will work in humans, researchers are optimistic, and further scientific inquiry will help answer this question.</td>
