 Achieving a Master's qualification may involve taking a final dissertation after completing a PGDip course. Some Master's courses are modularised, allowing greater flexibility by offering a wide choice of options which complement the prescribed field. Master of Business Administration (MBA) This qualification focuses on the principles of management and the development of management skills, and is by nature a broad course for students over the age of 25 who have at least two years of management experience. Professional Qualifications We offer a range of professional qualifications and courses which combine academic with professional awards, for example the Common Professional Examination in Law. Details of all our taught courses may be found by searching under the appropriate Faculty.</td>

 And it provides us with an opportunity to see how the student operates within the environment. If it is with another company it is still worthwhile as well, because by questioning the graduates on how they saw their work experience and how they viewed the hands-on experience, that is very useful information in the recruitment process. We have somebody here for eight weeks in her summer holiday who is actually getting paid and is looking at a possible career in retail management and is utilising her holidays to have an insight into that. But we interviewed her the same as we would a graduate, exactly the same, to make sure that she still had the skills required to operate in the system. My colleagues tell me the trick is to get into the higher education, get links into the departments, into the staff who are in there, and then you start to identify the better students.</td>
