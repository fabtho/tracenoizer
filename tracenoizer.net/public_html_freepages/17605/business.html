 By developing and conducting cross-generational surveys, children will integrate peoples' attitudes and practices regarding trash and recycling to see if they have (or have not) changed over time. Children will discover that new isn't always better if one truly wishes to conserve natural resources. Children will develop research questions for business managers in the community and use a variety of ways to collect information (correspondence by letter or telecommunications, field trips, interviews). Children will examine efforts by businesses to care for the Earth. Through reading and discussion, students will examine stories about children around the world to compare their feelings about the Earth and its environment.</td>
