 As part of this project we are implementing a small memory footprint JVM. . Lund CS Dept; SDE Research; Dynamic Distributed Software Go up. However, in two specific and important applications, cellular phones and industrial robots, severe demands on memory usage and real-time properties pose special problems. A number of trade-offs have to be investigated and verified by prototype implementations.</td>

 With the partners of Westbank Industries and Tactile Technology Knowbotic Research has founded mem_brane, a laboratory for media strategies. . These models are complex dynamic fields, which produce an exchange between virtual agents, poetic machines and interactive visitors. Knowbotic Research outlines technoid events parallel in real and virtual spaces to investigate the experience of the multiple layers of reality. The organization is based in Cologne at the Academy for Media Arts.</td>

 For remarks about the installation Dialogue with the Knowbotic South, cf also the text by Andreas Broeckmann. . These models are complex dynamic fields which produce an exchange between virtual agents, poetic machines and interactive visitors. They enable an observer the physical exploration and construction of networked rules and strategies of the new public spheres. These extensions of the cultural environment provoke new cultural and aesthetical parameters in order to prevent an ideological closed circuit in an information based society.</td>
