After the introductions (this takes about an hour) comes the mingling part. For the next 45 minutes to an hour, you move around the room checking out (and being checked out by) potential dates. As you stop and chat with various men, you may add some numbers to your list, or you may take some off. The aim is to find out what you have in common, and the well-lit room avoids a meat-rack atmosphere.">

 A Hot Spot is an area, when left unattended will gradually take over. My favorite analogy is of a hot spot in a forest fire, if left alone it will eventually get out of hand and burn up the whole forest. If left unattended, the hot spot will grow and take over the whole room as well as making the house look awful. When you walk into a room, the hot spot is the first thing you see. We put the unopened mail there, as well as any thing that needs to go to the basement.</td>
