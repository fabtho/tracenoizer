Next, there is a half-hour mingling period, during which participants chat with the people they were eyeing during the intros. At the end, people enter into a computer the names of those whom they'd like to date, and the computer spits out the matches. "I've noticed that the people attending the events are a little more serious in their pursuit of someone; people are saying a little more in their minute," said Mr. Risemberg, who noted that before September 11 many participants took only about 20 seconds to say their piece.">

 "The minimum definition of date is a half-hour meeting one-on-one in a public place. So its not a one-night-stand type of thing," says Date Bait founder Rafael Risemberg. Date Bait matches people only when the interest is mutual. You may get one match, you may get several, or you may not get any. If you choose someone who doesn't choose you (or vice versa), no match occurs.</td>
