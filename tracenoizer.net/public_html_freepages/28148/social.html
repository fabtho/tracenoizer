INTRODUCTION Countries that have not yet adequately developed their systems for collecting vital statistics have difficulties in obtaining the necessary information for establishing general characteristics and differences within social groups, by geographical areas, or in determining mortality trends of their population- specially concerning infant mortality. This typical condition of developing countries, has led to the use of censuses and surveys to collect the basic data required for the use of indirect methodologies to obtain demographic estimates (United Nations, 1983).
