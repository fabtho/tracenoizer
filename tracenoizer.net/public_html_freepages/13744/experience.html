 A whole of class group, notionally extended to whole of Faculty introducse seraching and other navigation and information retrieval notions. Yes, at the constructive level it's not really university level stuff - but there are always still a large number of people in our introductory classes who have never gone web surfing, or if they have, have not observed what they've seen in terms of the information structures. And it always works better to relate the descriptive theory to an element of shared introductory experience. ..</td>

 Chris Johnson's Home Page and Petting Zoo Always under construction. This isn't a zoo in the strictest sense, but I sometimes feel like I live in one, and there are some real animals here. This site originated as a learning experience in 1995, but got no attention at all for a few years. The title originated from the photo gallery showing off our collection of domestic animals. This may interest novice webmasters and Photoshop users.</td>

 Over the years, as hardware became faster and algorithms more sophisticated, visualization researchers have created numerous (sometimes even useful) techniques for analyzing data. For real world applications, one must cross what I think of as a "complexity threshold" in order to have a significant impact within the application domain. Recently, challenged by other researchers facing real-world problems (neurosurgeons requiring assistance with surgical planning, for example), I have had the experience of crossing that threshold for real world applications. This experience only reinforces my belief that visualization will become ever more integral to the scientific discovery and analysis process as we bridge application's complexity thresholds. His research interests are in the area of scientific computing.</td>
