 I live in northwest Tucson with my wife, Ingrid Novodvorsky, and our six cats (more about them in a minute). N to her students, taught at Mountain View High School in the Marana District for 11 years. In 2000, she joined the faculty in the College of Science (specifically the Physics Department) to begin development of a science teacher preparation program. She works with two other new faculty on developing one component of the program (she will be preparing future Physics teachers) and to do science education research. Ingrid and I do not have kids (a conscious choice) although we do share looking after three fine children of our friends, the Maddens.</td>
