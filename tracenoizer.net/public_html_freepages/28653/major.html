Based on WABCO's years of experience with developing braking and safety systems for commercial vehicles, all the components of the IVTM system have been especially designed to combat the tough conditions faced daily by trucks. The longer wheelbase, larger number of wheels and axles, more metallic components in the vehicle structure and severe and changing loading conditions are the major differences in comparison with cars. Also, commercial vehicle architecture is more critical regarding the quality of the data radio transmission. The IVTM system was designed to take account of all these criteria, for instance the location of the wheel module outside the wheel.">
