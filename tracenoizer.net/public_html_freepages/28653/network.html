<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" The authors present a set of distributed recovery techniques called CPR (Complete Process Recovery) that utilize vector time to handle failures and address both consistent-state restoration and the associated message-handling issues. The latter is important, because some recovery techniques delegate the handling of lost or duplicate messages to the message-transport mechanism. This requires the ability to checkpoint the network layer (a serious restriction), because the network is generally unaware of the anomalous messages induced by process failure and recovery. CPR requires nonfailed processes to roll back at most once in response to a single failure, and has low message complexity. Processes required to roll back after a failure do so concurrently, which substantially decreases recovery delay after a failure has occurred.">
