 A red lamp indicates a critical pressure loss; the driver should stop the vehicle immediately. The position of the concerned tire and its current inflation pressure can be called up at the push of a button. In order to avoid distracting the driver with unnecessary information, the tire inflation pressures are displayed only at the push of a button. Under normal circumstances there is no pressure display. Based on WABCO's years of experience with developing braking and safety systems for commercial vehicles, all the components of the IVTM system have been especially designed to combat the tough conditions faced daily by trucks.</td>
