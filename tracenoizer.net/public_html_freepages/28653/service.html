<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" IVTM Reduces Costs As manual tire pressure checks are tiresome and dirty, they are neglected all too frequently. This results in increased rolling resistance leading to higher fuel consumption. In addition, even when the tire pressure is only slightly incorrect, the consequences include increased flexing energy which results in a significantly reduced tire service life. IVTM helps you to keep tire pressures at optimum levels, thereby cutting fuel and tire costs in the long-term. Furthermore, IVTM avoids the need for costly, manual tire pressure checks.">
