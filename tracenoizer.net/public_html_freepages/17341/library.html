 . First off I would like to thank you for such a wonderful resource (the Feature Book Reviews section of ERCB) it made life as a student much easier, more rewarding and most importantly more enjoyable. I hate the fact I buy one book for an introductory course another for an advanced course and still another for my own personal library only to find the third could have served all three requirements. Please help out starving students (future subscribers), out-to-lunch instructors and those wishing to learn on their own and create such a section. Thanks and keep up the good work, David Thompson A great idea, but it needs the participation of domain experts.</td>
