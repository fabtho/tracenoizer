 The teacher learns what part of the school curriculum best supports the needs of a student preparing for a career in scientific research and engineering. In the one and on-half years that the program has been developing, there have been several instances that exemplify how teachers are willing to change in order to help the students more quickly function in a real world situation. Keeping up with current trends in computer languages in one area where YES students have brought knowledge from their independent study experience to their classrooms. The teacher is now studying ways in which this new knowledge can be incorporated into her computer science classes. Drafting is another area where computer technology has recently made a major impact, where the interaction between the YES program and teacher education has resulted in cross fertilization.</td>
