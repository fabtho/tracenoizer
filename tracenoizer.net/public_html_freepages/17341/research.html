 . Paper on YES Young Engineers and Scientists A Mentorship Program Using Information Technology The Goals of YES The Educational Benifits TeacherParticipation Acknowledgements Reference The Goals of YES The Primary goal of YES is to encourage talented students to pursue science and engineering majors in high school and college; first, by expanding career awareness including information on "hot" career areas an increased presence of working scientists and engineers in local high schools , secondly, by allowing students to interact on a continuing basis with role models at SwRI. SwRI staff members, including females and minorities, recruit YES participants from local high schools by presenting talks and slide shows about their ongoing research projects. These presentations are given on a volunteer basis. During the academic school year, displays and presentations of the participants' work in the local schools increase the benefits of the YES program by spreading career awareness to other students and teachers.</td>

 Young Engineers and Scientists Program 1997 Version Web Page Welcome to the YES program Web page. The YES program was designed to open students' minds to the world of engineering and science in order to delineate and clarify different career fields and to offer them the opportunity to explore their interests. This is an enriching summer program for high school juniors and seniors held at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas. Participating students are interested in taking ISM (Independent Study Mentorship). YES helps these students find a mentor and get a head start on their project.</td>
