 But a services environment is only one of a number of issues that must be resolved if engineers and software developers are to be assured their designs will work correctly in a net-centric world, according to several contributors to this week's Focus section on programming the Web. According to Kelvin Nilsen, CTO and founder of Newmonics Inc. ), a single Java implementation may not be suitable in the diverse telecom, datacom and networking environment. However, Object Technology's Erickson believes the newest Java specification-the result of a significantly expanded community process-could well deal with many of those requirements as well. Though the Web-services framework idea promises to simplify life for developers, the variety of new connectivity options, protocols and environments is making it more confusing.</td>
