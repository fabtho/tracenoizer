 . Individual Major Overview Individual Major Overview Along with College Honors and the Departmental Scholar programs, Honors Programs also houses the Individual Major Program. This option is available to those outstanding students who have well-defined, interdisciplinary interests for which no suitable major is offered in the traditional academic disciplines. Please refer to the Individual Major Requirements page for guidelines and to see if you qualify for this program. For additional information on Individual Majors, please call 825-1553 or come by the Honors office (A-311 Murphy) and make an appointment with Honors Counselor, Toi Turner.</td>

 The major is designed by the student and is subject to approval by faculty advisers and appropriate college committees. The Individual Major for many students is a creative approach to their education, and even the process of committee approval (which requires students to justify their goals and interests) becomes an educational experience. The major proposal must clearly and specifically state the student's educational goals and provide, where appropriate, a basis for the applicant's career objectives, as well as meet University and College academic standards. MULTIPLE MAJORS AND OTHER CREATIVE ALTERNATIVES Other approaches to individualized academic planning that allow a student to combine two or more interests are the minor programs offered by the College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences and the College of Letters and Science. Minors are optional and chosen by those students who want to pursue a comprehensive plan of study in an area (or areas) outside their major.</td>

 ) The courses at Sussex provided me with useful background knowledge of the country - its history, literature, etc. Do you feel you took full advantage of the intellectual possibilities available to you at Sussex or could you have done more. How did you prepare yourself for the academic aspect of your Year Abroad programme. But information sent to me from RLUS via the Secretary of our Russian Department was what really helped me choose where to go in Russia. How much help do you feel you received from Sussex in preparing you for your academic programme abroad.</td>
