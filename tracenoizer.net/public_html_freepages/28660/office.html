 Prior to graduation, both advisors are required to certify that the student has fulfilled all requirements for the major as outlined in her approved plan of study. Once the plan has been discussed and approved, the proposal form should be completed by the student, signed by both advisors, and submitted to the Class Dean or Dean of Continuing Education. After the Dean's signature has been obtained, please return to Jennifer Lewis (Registrar's office) for presentation to the CCI for final approval. The Committee on Curriculum and Instruction will not ordinarily accept individual major proposals in the senior year. After an individual major has been approved, the student must complete the courses planned for the major as described in her proposal.</td>
