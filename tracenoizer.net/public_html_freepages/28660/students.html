 Each college has its own philosophy and procedures related to the Individual Major Program, but essentially the major is an integrated program composed of courses from two or more specialization areas. The major is designed by the student and is subject to approval by faculty advisers and appropriate college committees. The Individual Major for many students is a creative approach to their education, and even the process of committee approval (which requires students to justify their goals and interests) becomes an educational experience. The major proposal must clearly and specifically state the student's educational goals and provide, where appropriate, a basis for the applicant's career objectives, as well as meet University and College academic standards. MULTIPLE MAJORS AND OTHER CREATIVE ALTERNATIVES Other approaches to individualized academic planning that allow a student to combine two or more interests are the minor programs offered by the College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences and the College of Letters and Science.</td>
