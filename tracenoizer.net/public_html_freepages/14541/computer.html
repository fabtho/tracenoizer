<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" Is there a principled way of "analyzing away" the environmental and logistic differences between Devon Island and Mars, to produce data that will be valid on Mars. I review the motivation for working in the arctic, plus the activities and results of the past three field seasons of the Haughton-Mars Project. I emphasize the interests of computer scientists, focusing on representational tools (such as data-logging devices), the communications and computing infrastructure (especially between remote sites and base camp), and prototype telescience devices (such as "robot geologists"). Extensive photographs, video, and time-lapse photography illustrate my ethnographic approach to studying a modern field expedition. Based on this experience, I provide a framework for characterizing similarities and differences between Devon and Mars and a strategy for defining experimental protocols using FMARS.">
