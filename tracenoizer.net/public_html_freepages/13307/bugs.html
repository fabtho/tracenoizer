Prints of each film were black-and-white, and it was not until 1969, when television stations across the United States demanded color, that Warner Brothers manufactured color prints of those early films that were originally produced in black and white. In 1960, Warner Brothers added post-1948, color Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies to its package for syndication (direct sale to individual television stations), while the ABC network aired select post-1948 classics on The Bugs Bunny Show.
