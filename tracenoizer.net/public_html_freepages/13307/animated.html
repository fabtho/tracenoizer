 I'd like to pay special tribute to Swannee Nardandrea for accepting the challenge and completing this outstanding collection of children's wildlife drawings that has become Florida's Animated Alphabet. . Florida's Animated Alphabet is designed to introduce young children to Florida's wide variety of native wildlife and the interesting natural history and behavior of its wild creatures. Learning can be creative and fun and Florida's Animated Alphabet is one way to have fun with young children while teaching the building blocks of our language and the fundamentals of wildlife appreciation. Positive attitudes toward conservation and constructive conservation actions begin with creating awareness and fostering deep-rooted values and attitudes toward all our natural resources.</td>
