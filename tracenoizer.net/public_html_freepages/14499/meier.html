<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" "In the case of cyclosporine, it appears the answer is yes all around. " The study looked back at the experiences of 29,786 people who received kidney transplants between 1994 and 1997, and whose medical histories were recorded anonymously by the United States Renal Data System. Kaplan worked with co-author Herwig-Ulf Meier-Kriesche, M. , an assistant professor of nephrology at UMMS, to sort out which had been treated with the older and newer forms of cyclosporine, and how they fared during the first four years after their transplant. Since the new form of cyclosporine has already been shown to reduce acute rejection, the researchers were most interested in the issue of long term kidney, or allograft, survival; patients who lost their new kidneys within 6 months of transplant were excluded.">
