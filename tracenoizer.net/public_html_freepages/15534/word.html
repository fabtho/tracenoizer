 0 for most of college, and reading the text today means that I have to use a conversion program. In the process, I may lose formatting or some of my writing. If I used specific Word features, I may not get a clean conversion. For the most part, my Word files are still easily readable, since Word was widely used and is still being sold. But WriteNow, the word processor that replaced Word on my hard drive in 1994, was not so fortunate.</td>

 All measurements indicate the dimensions of a book when closed unless otherwise indicated. . Coupled with text, pictures enhance the power of the written word. This exhibition showcases illustrated books in modern foreign languages from the fifteenth through the twentieth centuries selected from the rich and varied special collections of the Libraries of The Claremont Colleges. Here are artists as assorted as an anonymous 15th century painter who decorated a Dutch manuscript to a 20th century American book artist whose pulp painting ignites a French poem.</td>
