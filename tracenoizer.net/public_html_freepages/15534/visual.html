 INTERACTION began as an online forum concerning practices that employ networking technologies as a means of critically reflecting on contemporary societies. The participants illustrate how the Internet can help forge new kinds of communities, dialogues, and intimate connections. The essays and visual projects address the kinds of cultural identifications facilitated and altered by the Internet; the relationship between art and activism; the poetics of online communication; the relevance of the museum in a digital world; and the complex relationships between bodies, information systems and urban realities. Excerpts from INTERACTION and a special study guide are available on the Eyebeam website at www. The free study guide, written by Lisa Safier, is a learning tool for teachers and students seeking to explore this book in depth.</td>
