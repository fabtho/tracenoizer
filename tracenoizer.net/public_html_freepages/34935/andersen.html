 The firm has always remained a family business and is now run by members of the fourth generation, Uni and Jon David-Andersen. . Andersen (1843-1901) was a gold and silversmith with a keen sense of quality and the high standards of his workmanship brought early success. By 1888, Andersen was able to expand his workshop into a steam powered plant and a second retail location was opened in Oslo in 1892. David Andersen died in 1901 and his son, Arthur Andersen, took the reins of the firm.</td>
