David Anderson is being honored for his work in the fields of neurobiology, developmental biology, and genetics, where he has been able to make advances in stem-cell research that he hopes will eventually help fight brain diseases and spinal-cord injuries. Anderson has also made important discoveries in the field of angiogenesis, the study of blood vessel formation. Alden Spencer Award in Developmental Neurobiology from Columbia University.</td>
