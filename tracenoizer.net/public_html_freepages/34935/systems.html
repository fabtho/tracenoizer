<meta name="Description" lang=" "content=" . This talk will explore why---access network failures, inter-provider and wide-area routing anomalies, domain name system faults, and server-side failures all have a role to play---and discuss how to improve the situation. I will describe two systems that can take advantage of the path redundancy available in the Internet and improve end-to-end availability by one or two orders of magnitude compared to the current state. The key idea is to deploy an overlay network of nodes in different organizations and networks, have them carefully measure and monitor the status of available paths, and rely on them to cooperatively route packets by way of each other to bypass faults. This talk will describe two systems---RON (resilient overlay networks) and RAN (resilient access networks)---which use this core idea for different applications.">

 . In this position, he is responsible for developing strategies for next generation optical network products. Andersen has been with Agilent, which was an arm of Hewlett-Packard until November 1999, for more than 18 years in a variety of engineering and management positions involving telecommunication systems. He has successfully developed a wide range of solutions and has played key roles in creating strategic partnerships within the industry. Prior to joining Agilent, Andersen spent 10 years as a senior research associate at the University of Missouri School of Medicine, where he developed imaging systems for biomedical research.</td>
