 This talk presents an analysis of three years of data collected on the 31-site RON testbed, and studies the results from a six-site deployment of a RAN proxy that's been in active use for 9 months. The experimental evidence suggests that RON can reduce failures by a factor of six, and that with physical path redundancy, RAN eliminates almost all network-based failures. student in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at MIT. degrees in Computer Science and Biology from the University of Utah.
