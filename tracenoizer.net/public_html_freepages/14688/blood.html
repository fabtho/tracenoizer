The NDA includes data from the OCTAVE study and its review by the FDA is ongoing. The study was designed to allow physicians to electively increase dosage of study drug (Vanlevor enalapril) or add other antihypertensive therapies as needed to control blood pressure. This design allowed for the possibility that both treatment groups would yield equivalent blood pressure results at the end of the trial. At the end of the study, more patients treated with enalapril required an increase in dosage or the addition of other antihypertensive therapies in order to reach target blood pressure.">

 . Fluid therapy in this situation is not related to dehydration vets only recognize this Hydration procedure only. The fluids are used for a way to flush and maintain a good blood circulation so the body tissues are well nourished, it also helps remove body toxins by increasing blood flow to the kidneys and by increasing the excreted excess creatinine(toxins) in the urine, which the pet's kidneys are unable to do very well. This therapy is rather easy to do, takes 4 to 5 minutes a day, and it works best if the guardian learns how to do this at home so it can be done easily and regularly . Ask your Vet to show you how to do this and supply the bag of fluids and small needles.</td>

 . Valvular Disease Congestive Heart Failure What affects one side of the heart eventually will effect both sides as the heart and lungs are interconnected systems. Left side failure occurs when left ventricular output is less than the volume of blood received from the right side of the heart via the pulmonary circulation. Congestion in the pulmonary circuit ensues and the systemic blood pressure falls. Myocardial infarction is the most common cause of left heart failure but it can also be caused by hypertension, aortic insufficiency or cardiomyopathy.</td>

 As defined by the Frank-Starling mechanism, the ability of the heart to alter the force of contraction is dependent on changes in preload. As the myocardial fibers are stretched, the force of contraction is increased. Because the length of the fiber is determined primarily by the volume of blood in the ventricle, LVEDV is the primary determinant of preload. 7 This graph depicts the Frank-Starling mechanism of compensation in CHF. The curves represent ventricular function in a normal subject and one with left ventricular dysfunction.</td>
