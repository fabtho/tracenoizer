 The purpose of this work is to better understand the nature of the interpersonal style characteristics of ADHD children, and to apply this information to designing procedures to enhance treatment maintenance and generalization. Carlson's lab are gender differences, peer relationships, and attentional style in ADHD children. Cohen's research examines infant perceptual and cognitive development during the first 18 months. By using a simple procedure that involves the infant looking at a slide-projected or computer-generated picture and by recording the infants' visual fixation time, he is investigating how infants organize the visual information they see and how well they remember that information. His research has found consistent developmental differences in infants' organization of simple visual information into complex patterns, objects, and events.</td>
