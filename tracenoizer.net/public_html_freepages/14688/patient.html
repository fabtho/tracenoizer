 . REGISTER HERE LOGIN Patients emit an aura of data Patients under intensive care who twist and turn in their sleep may find themselves caught in a mass of wires and tubes. This might even loosen the pulse sensor, making the alarm go off on the monitoring system, waking the patient. Wireless sensors transmitting data on blood pressure, pulse rate or body temperature would eliminate such inconvenience and may allow the awake patient to enjoy complete freedom of movement. However, the existing radio transmission standards are problematic or are not authorized for use in hospitals.</td>

 TPD will continue to provide information helpful to patients, the public and the transplant community. . Transplant Living - UNOS Patient Services Home Page Welcome to Transplant Living. We invite patients and their families to browse this website for transplant information. Explanations of proposed model for end stage liver disease (MELD) The MELD system is expected to save lives on the waiting list by more accurately determining who is in greatest need of a liver transplant.</td>

 Empysema is a progressive, destructive lung disease, usually caused by smoking. The disease destroys air sacs in the lungs which enable oxygen to enter the bloodstream and let carbon dioxide leave the body. Eventually, the damaged air sacs inhibit the patient's ability to breathe properly. As the disease continues, there is progressive inflation of the lungs, resulting in further impairment. The usual treatment involved oxygen, immunization and bronchodialators.</td>
