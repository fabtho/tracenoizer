 The US captive, CWO Michael Durant, was released by Aideed Thu along with a Nigerian UN soldier who had been held since September 5. Armored personnel carriers and tanks were arriving in Mogadishu within days of the attack, and President Clinton announced steps to send additional troops, complete the mission and withdraw by March 31, 1994.
