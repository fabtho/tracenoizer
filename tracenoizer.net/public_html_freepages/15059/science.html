History The Fund was established by a group of concerned black technical professionals who realized that it is essential to provide financial assistance to talented black students who choose to pursue scientific or technical careers. Additionally, these students are supported at historically black institutions of higher learning, where it has been demonstrated that they will experience the highest rates of retention and graduation.</td>
