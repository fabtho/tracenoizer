 . The thesis is a study of the change of Element Order in early English and the causes of such changes. Early English is a valuable source of evidence for the ways in which language change can occur, for (as is well known) it underwent a change from a highly inflected language with relatively free element order to one in which grammatical function is expressed to a great degree by element order - which is comparitively fixed. It is hoped that by studying data from the period of greatest flux in the language - late OE to early ME - that some light will be thrown on the details of and reasons for such language drift. This period saw several important changes, both in Element Order and in syntax generally as well as in other features such as lexis and pronunciation, and many of these changes are related.</td>
