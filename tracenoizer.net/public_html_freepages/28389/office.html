 (1) Follow-up on the discussion of the Report of the Director-General to the 85th Session of the International Labour Conference The Governing Body examined follow-up measures on the two parts of the Director-General's report to the 85th Session of the Conference (1997) on the future of ILO standard-setting activities. With respect to the first part, concerning the universal guarantee of fundamental rights as a prerequisite for workers to be able to share the benefits of globalization, the Governing Body decided in November 1997 to include an item on the agenda of the present session of the Conference relating to the consideration of a possible Declaration of principles concerning fundamental rights and its appropriate follow-up. A series of consultations within and outside the Governing Body have taken place since that decision was taken, and the Office has accordingly prepared the draft text now submitted to the Conference under the seventh item on its agenda. The second part of the report of the Director-General proposed possible improvements to the ILO's standard-setting activities to ensure that standards have a greater impact and better meet constituents' needs. After a preliminary discussion in November 1997, the Governing Body decided to examine the various proposals at its session in November 1998.</td>
