wav The famous first skit of rabbit-or-duck-hunting-season episode, in its entirety. wav Elmer thinks he's run out of bullets as he hunts after Daffy in the rabbit-or-duck-hunting-season episode. wav Daffy "can take a hint" and leaves a sleepless Porky Pig. wav The moustache graffitin' Daffy Duck admires his handiwork. wav A loudmouth Daffy assaults an overtired Porky with the details of a party he went to.</td>
