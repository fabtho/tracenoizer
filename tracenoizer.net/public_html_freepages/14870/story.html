 . A week later he was commissioned to take over the illustration of Diana Ross's Little Red Engine books from Jan Lewitt and George Him who, much as they had loved illustrating the first book in the series, The Little Red Engine gets a Name, were under much pressure to do other war-related work and therefore declined to continue with the subsequent stories in the series. At about the same time as Wood was commissioned to illustrate The Story of the Little Red Engine, he was also commissioned to illustrate Whoo Whoo the Wind blew. Neither of these stories could be published until after the end of the war because of the shortages of paper and coloured printing inks. He went on to illustrate numerous other children's books.</td>

 In the upcoming months I will be greatly expanding the Tick content to include page art, sketches, alternate covers and character designs, as well as more covers and Circus Maximus portraits. The Runners section is devoted to the space adventure series I am currently working on. Currently the section consists of the entire 7-page short story I originally did for the Small Press Expo Anthology 2000. Also please feel free to e-mail me with any comments and suggestions. .</td>
