 The fourth and final edition is the one reprinted here. The two published lecture series of 1806 are of particular interest, since Fichte did not publish any of the more technical versions of his philosophy after arriving in Berlin in 1800. Instead he announced his new standpoint in his popular works, Characteristics of the Present Age and The Way Towards the Blessed Life, the former of which is explicitly concerned with the philosophy of history, and the latter of which is explicitly concerned with the philosophy of religion. In addition to these translated texts, The Popular Works also includes a lengthy and valuable intellectual biography of Fichte by Smith. .</td>
