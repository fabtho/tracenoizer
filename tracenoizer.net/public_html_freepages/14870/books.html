 He went on to illustrate numerous other children's books. . A week later he was commissioned to take over the illustration of Diana Ross's Little Red Engine books from Jan Lewitt and George Him who, much as they had loved illustrating the first book in the series, The Little Red Engine gets a Name, were under much pressure to do other war-related work and therefore declined to continue with the subsequent stories in the series. At about the same time as Wood was commissioned to illustrate The Story of the Little Red Engine, he was also commissioned to illustrate Whoo Whoo the Wind blew. Neither of these stories could be published until after the end of the war because of the shortages of paper and coloured printing inks.</td>

For a while it seemed as if every time I admired the watercolor illustrations in a children's book, they turned out to be by Jerry Pinkney. Among my favorites are his illustrations for Aesop's Fables, Hans Christian Andersen's The Ugly Duckling, Valerie Flournoy's The Patchwork Quilt, and Patricia McKissack's Goin' Someplace Special.</td>

 Now 29, Sarah graduated from Anglia Poly in 1996 then moved on to do an MA in Brighton before returning here to work freelance. The difficult thing has been getting myself to the standard I considered good enough to progress. During my MA I had written and illustrated four books (Little Fella) for my portfolio so I had some ready-made material to give to publishers. Orchard really liked the character Little Fella and commissioned two books, which is quite unusual. Research is very important, finding the right publishers who will be interested in your type of work.</td>
