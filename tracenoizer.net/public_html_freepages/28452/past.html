 Take care, Paul Bradley Dean of Residence Life Northwestern College 3003 Snelling Ave. . During this past year, we have seen an increasing number of our students experience personal financial troubles. In most cases, the students involved are simply not able to handle their money in a responsible manner. It seems that more and more students do not have a sense of how to budget or how to plan for future expenses.</td>

 The City Commission received good news from its City Hall expansion project now under way. The last asbestos removal is expected to be completed by April 1. Uneven floors due to past renovations created changes of more than an inch in the floors. Filling gouges and leveling the floor would make the overall renovations better, said Patrick Schaub, a representative of Brent Bowman and Associates, the architectural firm overseeing the construction. In other business, the commission also discussed the proposed annexation of the Sargent Addition north of Manhattan.</td>
