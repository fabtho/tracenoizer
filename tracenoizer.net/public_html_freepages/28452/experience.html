 Thousands of information systems professionals from over 100 separate organizations have benefited from the training provided through the NC State Information Systems Education (ISE) series over the past 20 years. Through practical, real-world content and instruction, our schedule of management, technical and programming short courses will provide participants with new skills and knowledge that they can use to increase their productivity and their value to the company.
