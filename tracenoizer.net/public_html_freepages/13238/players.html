 com) - January 17, 2001 Only someone completely distrustful of all government would be opposed to what we are doing with surveillance cameras. An audience forced to watch performances through the very device that has become the symbol of their daily oppression. Activist groups such as the Surveillance Camera Players draw upon humor and ambiguity as subversive political themes (thereby defeating appropriation of their iconography and methods by the mainstream), walking the razor-thin line between opportunism and self-depracating irony. As a reaction against the draconian policies advocated by New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, the Surveillance Camera Players are slowly building a state-wide anti-surveillance camera movement. Whether their fame lasts for fifteen seconds or fifteen years, the Surveillance Camera Players will be remembered as the agitprop theater troupe that made seizing the power and fighting back hip again.</td>
