 Students need to know and understand the current climate regarding legal use of information in order to avoid the pitfalls of plagiarism, copyright infringement, and violation of fair use guidelines. Plagiarism If you do not acknowledge the source, you are, in effect, stealing material from another writer. This is a serious offense within the academic world. Proper citation of sources is the best safeguard against plagiarism. Under certain conditions specified in the Law, libraries and archives are authorized to furnish a photocopy or other reproduction.</td>
