 If you usually have to buy an age group larger or smaller for your child, then allow for this in the sizing. Likewise, if the age falls in between that offered as a guide above ( ie an 8 and a half year old ) the general rule is to go UP A SIZE rather than down. If in any doubt at all, don't hesitate to contact us, and we'll use our 30 years expertise in the fashion arena to advise you accordingly. The dollar equivalent is for guidance only and will fluctuate depending on the prevailing rate of exchange. Therefore, simply make a note of the style number and size you need, and e-mail it to us here.</td>
