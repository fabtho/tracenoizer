 We watched our videos and had a look at the feedback from Norbert. After that we watched four videos about different communication styles in meetings and outlined the characteristics of each styles. I'm sorry but I'm not present there, because I'm in America. In my next meeting I will verify that all participants are present. the participants were a little bit patronised Christian Good organisation .</td>

 Norbert gave us today also a very interesting overview about decision meetings. He gave us a homework to prepare us for the next time to make a decision meeting with our colleagues. I'm sorry but I'm not present there, because I'm in America. In my next meeting I will verify that all participants are present. the participants were a little bit patronised Christian Good organisation .</td>
