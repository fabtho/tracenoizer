 . Shepherd came to the Council in the fall of 1973 and has been the Council's chief executive for 29 of its 36 year history. He had previously served on the staff of the Economic Development Council of Northeastern Pennsylvania and has been an Economist with the Economic Research Service in Washington, DC and served in the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) while an Army officer. Shepherd noted that most of his 40 year career since graduation from NC State University had been in his current position, unexpected when he moved to the region in 1973. I have enjoyed working with a creative staff of public servants and a board of locally elected leaders to advance this region.</td>

 First, instead of selling your past, try to get companies interested in things you want to do in the future. They may not get the ideal candidate pool, and this creates an opportunity to get them to rethink what they are looking for. For example, an electrical engineer may want to do business development or strategic marketing, rather than programming or project management. Companies simply need to hear the relevancy of your value to their business needs. Pretend you are hiring someone to be your next boss, or that you are essentially working for yourself.</td>
