 . Spam consumes computing resources, email administrator and helpdesk personnel time, and reduces workers' productivity. Despite the increasing deployment of anti-spam services and technology, the number of spam messages, and their size, is continuing to increase rapidly. The service provides recommendations on how to solve spam-related problems through a combination of anti-spam software, user education, and more effective email policies. Consumers, too, feel pain because hosted services (such as AOL and Hotmail) are inundated with spam.</td>

 Anyone interested in participating in ISL Tennis can contact HFw Walter Scheiber at AFNORTH ext. . After several messages via CRONOS and Public LAN we were able to collect a total of 36 person willing to join the ISL Tennis. This gave us the opportunity to build a singles competition with 28 players, divided in four groups and additional 14 double teams playing a "knock out" system. The above-mentioned constellation gave us a total of 70 singles matches and 13 double matches.</td>

 HAN provides each of us with an opportunity to continue our involvement with the Haas School. Please consider increasing your level of involvement today. Yet, these sections become more useful as increasing numbers of alumni update their profile and post job opportunities or messages for classmates and other alumni. Also, California State Law requires that graduates must give consent for their contact information to be revealed to other Haas graduates. Many Haas graduates have not yet given that consent.</td>
