 . Shepherd came to the Council in the fall of 1973 and has been the Council's chief executive for 29 of its 36 year history. He had previously served on the staff of the Economic Development Council of Northeastern Pennsylvania and has been an Economist with the Economic Research Service in Washington, DC and served in the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) while an Army officer. Shepherd noted that most of his 40 year career since graduation from NC State University had been in his current position, unexpected when he moved to the region in 1973. I have enjoyed working with a creative staff of public servants and a board of locally elected leaders to advance this region.</td>
