 But if it's a BITR, then golly-gee, let's get back to watching Monday Night football before the chip dip gets cold. . I think for the first couple of days, systems will be a little crazy, and we'll just have to wait for them to get back to normal. For anyone who has doen remediation of any kind on a system that is not working you know damn well they don't just "get back to normal". It's hard work, and it's probalby something that will get overlooked by the Doomers.</td>

 This condition is caused by trapping gas under the glaze during the process and, if present, within 30 to 90 days after refinishing. Your 48 month guarantee affords you ample protection against this unlikely possibility. The new finish will continue to cure (harden) for several months; however, this poses no problems or restrictions to normal usage of the bathtub. It's synthetic, which when applied, hardens to a beautiful high gloss porcelain like luster. The Bathtub King formula is a unique process developed specifically for bathtubs and laboratory tested to meet the highest standards of product performance and quality.</td>
