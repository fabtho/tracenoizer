 Synapomorphies of Discoglossanura include a bicondylar sacrococcygeal articulation and the presence of an episternum. Discoglossanura has two subgroups, Discoglossidae and Pipanura. However, her sampling of taxa is not sufficient to provide strong support for this clade, especially in light of the synapomorphies supporting other arrangements. The subordinal name Ranoidei was coined for this clade by Sokol (1977), but that name was re-assigned to a less inclusive taxon by Dubois (1983, 1984). Sokol's (1977) use of this name was unfortunate because the informal name, ranoid, is homonymous with the widely used name Ranoidea.</td>
