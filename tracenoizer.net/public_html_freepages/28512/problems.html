 Also consult the page on remote access to Library products and services. Equally, there may be a current problem with a particular electronic product or service. The Library is usually aware of local problems, but we have Internet links to hundreds of electronic products from around the world, any one of which may experience downtime that the Library does not hear about. ..</td>

 . MWRtools Home Publications Download Contact Info Version 2 Overview Version 1. 3 Overview Functions Applications Algorithms Version 1 Documentation MWRtools Home Page MWRtools is a set of Matlab-5 based functions developed for solving boundary-value problems using globally defined trial function expansions and weighted residual methods (MWR). The numerical techniques form a computational toolbox consisting of a common set of numerical tools for implementing the different MWR techniques used in the numerical solution and analysis of systems described by ordinary and partial differential equation models. This library represents the results of our initial efforts to create computational modules that have a one-to-one correspondence with each step of implementing eigenfunction expansion, Galerkin projection, collocation, and other weighted residual methods.</td>

 It was the sixties and I had recently been promoted to Assistant to the Director of Research at Philco Corporation. I worked with Senior Scientists and Researchers with whom I had developed a respectful, interested and inquisitive approach that permitted me to have entree into their world. Better me than the Director The Research Division was going through a rapid expansion and relocation and the Director needed someone to interface with the scientists on day to day routine problems. These problems were of little interest to the research staff and I had to be careful in pressing for the information needed. It was a case of better me than the Director as the person to annoy them for the answers.</td>
