 The 18 selected papers present an overview of the state-of-the-art in knowledge intensive engineering, discussing theoretical aspects and also practical systems and experiences gained in this area. An invited speaker paper is also included, discussing the role of knowledge in product and process innovation and technology for processing semantic knowledge. The volume is essential reading for researchers, graduate and postgraduate students, systems developers of advanced computer-aided design and manufacturing systems, and engineers involved in industrial applications. Hardbound, ISBN 0-7923-7619-6 November 2001, 264 pp. 2 has organized a series of workshops aimed at presenting and discussing current issues and future perspectives of Geometric Modeling in the CAD environment.</td>
