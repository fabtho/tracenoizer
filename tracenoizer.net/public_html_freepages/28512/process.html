 Institutions can more efficiently develop academic programs, handle customized course scheduling and catalogs, formulate and enforce academic policy, and manage faculty responsibilities. This module enables students to register for courses over the telephone without the need for human operators. This can save the institution time, labor, and money while making the registration process faster and more convenient for students. ..</td>

 This workshop looked at the evolution of knowledge intensive design for the product life cycle moving towards knowledge intensive engineering. The 18 selected papers present an overview of the state-of-the-art in knowledge intensive engineering, discussing theoretical aspects and also practical systems and experiences gained in this area. An invited speaker paper is also included, discussing the role of knowledge in product and process innovation and technology for processing semantic knowledge. The volume is essential reading for researchers, graduate and postgraduate students, systems developers of advanced computer-aided design and manufacturing systems, and engineers involved in industrial applications. Hardbound, ISBN 0-7923-7619-6 November 2001, 264 pp.</td>
