 Systems design engineering is a rational response to an increasingly complex technological society. As a systems design engineer, you'll use a multidisciplinary approach to analyse and define problems that lie at the interface of society, technology, and the environment. In our program, we've built a broad, interdisciplinary foundation around a core of systems analysis and design courses. A key element is the Systems Design Workshop, where you'll explore and apply design principles and methods in a series of project-oriented courses beginning in first year. In your upper years, you'll pursue technical electives in your own interest area and work on related real-world design projects.</td>

 MWRtools Home Publications Download Contact Info Version 2 Overview Version 1. 3 Overview Functions Applications Algorithms Version 1 Documentation MWRtools Home Page MWRtools is a set of Matlab-5 based functions developed for solving boundary-value problems using globally defined trial function expansions and weighted residual methods (MWR). The numerical techniques form a computational toolbox consisting of a common set of numerical tools for implementing the different MWR techniques used in the numerical solution and analysis of systems described by ordinary and partial differential equation models. This library represents the results of our initial efforts to create computational modules that have a one-to-one correspondence with each step of implementing eigenfunction expansion, Galerkin projection, collocation, and other weighted residual methods. Examples illustrating the use of the library of subprograms can be found at this website, including discussions of the development and application of more advanced MWR numerical techniques.</td>
