 WINCH grew from a small working model in the third-year SDE workshop to a large prototype with an innovative system for sensing and damping load swings. By incorporating fuzzy logic, the team developed a crane that could respond intuitively to unwanted motion. WINCH was a major winner in the 1998 Ontario and Canadian Engineering Competitions. Systems design engineering is a rational response to an increasingly complex technological society. As a systems design engineer, you'll use a multidisciplinary approach to analyse and define problems that lie at the interface of society, technology, and the environment.</td>

 The concept advocates that intensive life-cycle knowledge regarding products and design processes must be incorporated in the center of the CAD architecture. It focuses on the systematization and sharing of knowledge across the life-cycle stages and organizational boundaries. From Knowledge Intensive CAD to Knowledge Intensive Engineering comprises the Proceedings of the Fourth Workshop on Knowledge Intensive CAD, which was sponsored by the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) and held in Parma, Italy in May 2000. This workshop looked at the evolution of knowledge intensive design for the product life cycle moving towards knowledge intensive engineering. The 18 selected papers present an overview of the state-of-the-art in knowledge intensive engineering, discussing theoretical aspects and also practical systems and experiences gained in this area.</td>
