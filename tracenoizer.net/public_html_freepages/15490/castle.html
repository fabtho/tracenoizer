 This is no storybook land, but a region roamed by the real 15th century Count Vlad Tepes Dracula upon whom Bram Stoker based his famous novel, "Dracula. I had just descended from the Transylvanian Alps, where lay the roots of the maternal side of my heritage. Beyond Transylvania now, I was about to ascend to the castle set on a rocky Carpathian ridge, 120 miles northwest of Bucharest. It was a last minute impulse on the final day of the World Dracula Congress. Forty had come on this tour to see the Castle of Arges, named for the river that flows freely at the mountain's base.</td>

 Wallachia was a kind of buffer state between Hungary and the Ottoman Empire and, tired of paying tributes to the Turks who occupied the territory, Vlad fought against them. After a victory over the Turkish army, some Wallachian peasants witnessed a forest of stakes 1 km by 3 km wide, upon which 20000 Turkish and Bulgarian captives were impaled. He was detained at Visegrad castle, north of Budapest for 16 years. He enjoyed introducing his "house guest" at state dinners as an implied threat. Besides Vlad Tepes was said to play in his cell in Visegrad with bats, which are, as everybody knows, one of the animals Dracula can metamorphose into.</td>

 Sheep grazed in meadows near fences draped with drying hay. We braked for roaming cows and clopping horse-drawn leiterwagens. We were nearing the site of Stoker's famed castle, its frowning walls set atop a terrible precipice, holding dread secrets within. An unspooky giant cigarette pack ("Smoke Golden American") was stuck in the front lawn. We fought our way through a small horde of peasants hawking fresh raspberries and entered the hotel, built in 1983 in the vague shape of a castle to serve nearby ski runs.</td>

 The following year, he became commander of the forces defending Wallachia. In this timespan, he married (his wife's name is unknown) and he ended the draft of youths into the Turkish army, redistributed land to the peasants and built many churches. But he also used slave labor to build Castle Dracula, and massacred thousands of his subjects and enemies. His favored method was the stake, which is the reason for his historical title Tepes, Impaler. In six years, it has been estimated that he had 75,000 to 100,000 people impaled.</td>
