Nor does it have anything to do with any of the games published by White Wolf Publishing Inc. And, finally, I have no interest in helping to sell candy bars.</td>

 Although there is some uncertainty about its historical accuracy, Vlad is believed to have been buried at the Snagov monastery. "His headless body was buried at Snagiv, near Bucharest, but tales persisted that the grave was empty, Vlad having risen. " 3 Vlad's reputation grew even larger when historians and scholars began to speculate that Bram Stoker used the historical figure of the Impaler as the basis for the main character in his novel, Dracula. This topic has stirred a great deal of debate between scholars. It is a commonly held belief that Stoker's character shares at least some traits (particularly geography) with the famous villain, Dracula.</td>
