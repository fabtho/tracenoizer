 As a ruler, Vlad Tepes probably had some "Devilish" habits such as drinking human blood. She knew that dishonesty would prevail in the country again. The 1100's 1190 Walter Map's "De Nagis Curialium" includes accounts of vampire like beings in England. 1196 William of Newburgh's "Chronicles" records several stories of vampire like revenants in England. 1463 Vlad Tepes becomes Prince of Wallachia and moves to Tirgoviste.</td>
