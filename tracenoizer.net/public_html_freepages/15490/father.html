 . He was born into the Basarab family, the son of Vlad II. His father was Vlad Dracul, a soldier who commanded one of the units guarding the Wallachian-Transylvanian border, which was susceptible to attacks from both Turks and Hungarians. Dracul is thought to derive from either the Romanian word for devil, or from the knightly order of dragons that Daddy Dracul pledged his loyalty to. An interested reader, Daemon866, informs me that the name of Dracul was assumed after Daddy Vlad entered the Dragon order.</td>
