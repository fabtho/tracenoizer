The empirical analysis carried out in this paper tries to find out if mergers have increased banks' wealth or not.

 My first attempts resulted in too much variation, such that the intensity level was weakened, so I am now working with the fine line between too much variation and 'digitally perfect' stasis. .Notes About the Performances and Compositional Process In "Years of Fear" Performances and Compositional Process In "Years of Fear" Much of this music is formed from spontaneous interaction with unquantized sound. Free physical 'dancing'--with no predetermined direction whatsoever, the duration and direction of performance is completely determined by my energy level, stamina, and own interest in the sound being produced at the moment. I learn how the sounds respond during the performance, although I sometimes borrow from preexisting instrumental conception, e.</td>
