 Napalm burns at 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit and sticks to skin, even under water. In 1991, filmmaker Jill Godmilow saw Inextinguishable Fire for the first time during a Farocki retrospective. She reshot the film frame by frame, in English instead of German and in color instead of in black-and-white. Godmilow shot Inextinguishable Fire at the University of Notre Dame, where she is a professor in the Department of Film and Television. She recreated its austere dialogue and newsreel footage, its setting at a generic Dow Chemical lab, and the intertitles by which Farocki offered political commentary.</td>
