 The services listed above require a valid PennNet ID and password. Both the Language Resource Center and MMETS make audio and video digitizing services available. If you are interested in using technology for a course and want a broad overview of what's available and useful, take a look at Jim O'Donnell's New Tools for Teaching page. For new tools currently in use at Penn, consult Penn's New Tools for Teaching support site. There are other surveys of current tools and techniques as well, including ISC's Facilitating Faculty-Student Collaboration on the Internet.</td>
