 The Ciao programming environment includes a classical top-level and a rich emacs interface with an embeddable source-level debugger and a number of execution visualization tools. Library modules can be compiled into compact bytecode or C source files, and linked statically, dynamically, or autoloaded. The novel modular design of Ciao enables, in addition to modular program development, effective global program analysis and static debugging and optimization via source to source program transformation. These tasks are performed by the Ciao preprocessor (ciaopp, distributed separately). Ciao is distributed under the GNU General Public License.</td>

 In the latest Research Assessment Exercise (RAE), SPRU has again received one of the top ratings with a 5A grade. The RAE results, which were announced on 14 December 2001, confirm SPRU's position as one of the world's leading research centres in the field of science and technology policy. ) This report aims to provide up-to-date information on academic and policy analysis of the returns to academic research. It shows the capabilities that firms need to develop, the key business challenges they face, and outlines the experiences of five leading case study firms. SPRU Annual Review - an overview of our research, teaching and other activities over the past year, including key research findings, select bibliographies and the work of DPhil students.</td>

 Unusual as it seems, almost nobody knows about the existence of world-wide drug prohibition. The Swedish drug control system by Tim Boekhout van Solinge This book appeared in 1997, and can now be downloaded from this website. It is the first thorough analysis of Swedish drug policy and critically examines the claims about drug use and drug policy in Sweden. Their book of over 800 pages is the most extensive work on the legal control of both licit and illicit drugs in France. In the Preface to the second edition of this book (the first edition was published in 1990) Francis Caballero and Yann Bisiou conclude that French drug law is a 'mistake of historical proportions'.</td>
