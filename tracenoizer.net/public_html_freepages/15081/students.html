 You learned about programming algorithms using recursively defined procedures---first you curse, and then you recurse. You learned how to do mathematical proofs, and how to multiply matrices and compute cross products. Well, you students didn't venture out into this risky unknown, fraught with the danger of showing how ignorant you were precisely when everybody was watching, just out of youth and curiosity.

The unit was formed in late 1986 as a direct result of a strategic priority to use information technologies to help faculty teach and students learn more effectively. Information technologies provide dynamic tools that enhance teaching and learning. ETS serves as a bridge between these new technologies and the faculty's effective use of them.</td>
