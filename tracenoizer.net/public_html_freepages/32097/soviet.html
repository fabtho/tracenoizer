 A package of bills on state symbols submitted to the State Duma (parliament) also included the Tsarist-era red, white and blue tricolor and the double-headed eagle that have been used in Russia over the past few years and the red flag was reinstated as the symbol of the armed forces. This move, backed by President Vladimir Putin, caused a real schism in Russian political society. Most liberal and rightist figures and part of the Russian intelligentsia strongly opposed the endorsement of the music of the Soviet anthem as the national anthem. Most call it a symbol of the totali-tarian, Stalinist, Soviet past and a grave political mistake. The renowned writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn, musicians Mstislav Rostropovich and Galina Vishnevskaya and many other prominent Russians have expressed their opposition to the return to the Soviet-era melody.</td>
