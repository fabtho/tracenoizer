 But the golden age of our home culture that came after a very short (both from historical and human points of view) flash of Pushkin's genius was far beyond the horizon. Longing for world culture, if it is still alive, - is longing for Pushkin's epoch this time. The heights of Russian culture - are not so much ethical perfection as serving to conscience. Moral measuring of public actions is undoubtedly, the merit of Russian culture. In Russia literature and philology became the basis of it and it is not only our writers' merit but also the fact that philology is the main peculiarity of our home culture.</td>

 05 Five great Russian moments at the World Championships 11. .COM CONTACT Friday, 10th May An old song renewed for Russia Russian captain Andrei Kovalenko (right) sometimes finds himself singing the old words to the anthem Like other Russian athletes, members of the national hockey team experience a wide range of emotions when they hear their anthem played at a sporting event. As of December 2000, Russia reverted to using the music of the old Soviet anthem by assent of the Duma, the Russian parliament. Since the fall of the USSR, Russia had used a wordless piece by the classical composer Glinka, but its lack of widespread popularity paved the way for the return of Alexander Alexandrov's melody, to which Sergei Mikhalkov added lyrics in 1943.</td>

 Mendy gave Nazarov a big lesson ; he led the action with his jab and hook to the head ans body. As a champion, Nazarov reacted as a hurt man but still the challenger won with a fair decision on points. The 2nd world championship of the night was between Julien Lorcy and Alexander Alexandrov for the WBO title, unfortunetely, Lorcy was once again dominated on points by the russian Alexandrov.
