Apparently, the first time they turned it on, the motors took out the entire power grid for Bethesda. The engineering problems with the Circulating Water Channel were getting constant water velocity across the channel cross section and eliminating a standing wave. I understand they eventually solved both problems, but the solutions were neither simple nor cheap. Stephens, the resistive forces on the hull are frictional drag, wave making, and induced drag (from the lift required of the keel to counter act leeway).">

 To us, sustainable development requires an integration of the ecological imperative to stay within the carrying capacity of the planet, the economic imperative to provide an adequate standard of living for all, and the social imperative to develop forms of governance that promote the values people want to live by. . We are committed to undertake research on sustainable development that advances knowledge and contributes to the solution of real-world problems. To us, sustainable development requires an integration of the ecological imperative to stay within the carrying capacity of the planet, the economic imperative to provide an adequate standard of living for all, and the social imperative to develop forms of governance that promote the values people want to live by. .</td>

 The IDRC Resource Clock has tracked the increase of human population and decrease of arable land since 1987, when the first clock was installed in the front lobby of IDRC's Ottawa headquarters. . International Development Research Centre - Science for Humanity The International Development Research Centre is a public corporation created by the Canadian government to help communities in the developing world find solutions to social, economic, and environmental problems through research. The argument is over an industry that, some say, is threatening the environment and others feel is important to sustain their economy. Canadian geographer Brian Szuster and a team of academics is helping resolve the issue of shrimp farming.</td>

 Formulate learning experiences to achieve programme objectives 7. Develop a plan of work and calender of activities for programme implementation 8. However research indicates that the people in the community will be receptive of new ideas if they are exposed to experiences that they feel will contribute to resolving their problems and fulfilling their needs. Unless the experiences are planned thoroughly and systematically for these purposes, the programme that is intended to bring about change may end up with failure or rejection. There are several benefits associated with proper planning before implementation.</td>
