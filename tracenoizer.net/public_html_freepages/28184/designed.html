 . As it turns out, my father inlaw was the naval officer in charge of the "Circulating Water Channel" and the Taylor Model Basin in Bethesda, MD during WW-II. The Circulating Water Channel was designed move water past a stationary model. The beast had, in addition to the test channel, two large reservoirs and two 12 foot diameter Westinghouse electric motors to move water from one to the other. Apparently, the first time they turned it on, the motors took out the entire power grid for Bethesda.</td>

 Slowdown is a funny subject, for example, Sega Rally 2 suffered slowdown and frame rate fluctuation, but didn't really spoil the enjoyment of the title. Gigawing2's slowdown is a quite serious flaw in a fast moving, mostly 2d game of this type, and it will hamper your enjoyment. Secondly, the 3d backdrops, while lovely to look at and exceptionally designed, move past far too fast for the eye to see. A reduction in the speed of scrolling would have produced a more visually stunning title. I believe that Gigawing 2 is also guilty of the same moments, but they are more frequent.</td>
