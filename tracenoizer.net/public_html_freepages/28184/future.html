 The commissions asked the university community to consider the following questions for discussion. Responses were recorded and are now part of the official written record. 1) What issues do you think will be most important as we discuss and plan for PLU's future. 2) As you think about the future of Pacific Lutheran University what are the important issues that need to be addressed by each of the four commissions. How do we assure an inclusive, affirming community.</td>

 IBM will have to pay damages to the former president of its Asian division after a federal judge found the company violated his employment contract. If 'baby face' Palmisano had any guts he'd tell Lou to curb the gestapo HR tactics. Fewer and fewer people want to work at IBM and those left in there that have any skill or future are all planning their exits. The carefully designed move should capture the attention of other over-funded plans, some of whose surpluses range into the billions. Habel believes Ethyl won't be the only pension plan to restructure itself in this way.</td>
