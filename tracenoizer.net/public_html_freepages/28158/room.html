 The chairs are arranged in a circular formation that allows everyone to see and hear what they need to in order to reach a decision. After the introductions (this takes about an hour) comes the mingling part. For the next 45 minutes to an hour, you move around the room checking out (and being checked out by) potential dates. As you stop and chat with various men, you may add some numbers to your list, or you may take some off. The aim is to find out what you have in common, and the well-lit room avoids a meat-rack atmosphere.</td>

 While last month's event drew 80 lonely hearts to the 92nd Street Y, a comprable event last year drew only 51, Mr. Date Bait, originally formed as a gay singles event, is a mixer divided into three parts. In the first part, everyone in the room spend a minute introducing themselves to the group. Next, there is a half-hour mingling period, during which participants chat with the people they were eyeing during the intros. At the end, people enter into a computer the names of those whom they'd like to date, and the computer spits out the matches.</td>
