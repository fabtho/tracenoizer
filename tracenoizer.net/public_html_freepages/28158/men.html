 Date Bait is a remarkably simple concept dreamt up four years ago by an Argentine Jew, Rafael Risemberg, who patented it last summer. Risemberg, now a 41-year-old education professor at Kean College in New Jersey, started Date Bait in October 1996 as a scheme for rustling up some dates for himself.
