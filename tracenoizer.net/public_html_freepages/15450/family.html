 Usage of both spellings was encountered often during review of old records. Land records for James have been found for 1837, but no further found on him. 1870 Grant Census records note an Elizabeth Tyson, age 73, living with a Richardson family - this was probably the wife of James. At least three brothers of Sarah Vince emigrated to this area and went on to Texas. They were among the original Texas settlers and had extensive land holdings in the Houston and Conroe area.</td>
