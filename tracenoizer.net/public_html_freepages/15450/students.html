 Expansion of knowledge and skills acquired in 100A. No knowledge of German is required for this course as all class discussion and all texts will be entirely in English. Against the background of Germany's 20th century history, but with particular emphasis on the past four decades, students will study Germany's growth from the complete destruction of 1945 to the democratic, cultural and economic strength of today. Materials to be studied include historical and topical documents, film, video and web-based resources. Depending upon academic area of interest, there will be opportunity for students to pursue and present findings on an individual topic selected from a wide variety of fields.</td>
