 Usage of both spellings was encountered often duringreview of old records. Land records for Jameshave been found for 1837, but no further found on him. 1870 Grant Censusnotes an Elizabeth Tyson, age 73, living with a Richardson family - thismay have been the wife of James or the second wife of William. At leastthree brothers and a sister of Sarah Vince emigrated to this area and wenton to Texas. They were among the original Texas settlers (1822) and are listed on the Austin Colony First 100 census rolls.</td>
