 But since he spent his life as an academic and according to a brief biography that I read held office in the Reformed Church of France and participated mainly in reformist environmentalist and social welfare activities in terms of political involvement, I would argue that was not so very consistently anarchist, far less than most anarchists I know. Now I'm on much more of an indigneous path in terms of spirituality, of course. This is mostly because I see that the ultimate demands of living in ANY community in this day and age to be contradictory enough to my anarchism to cause me nervous tension on many levels. It seems to me that the contradictions inherent in being a christian anarchist are little more than the contradictions inherent in being any kind of anarchist right now (other than maybe a primitivist anarchist that has found a tribe to be a part of. give me a wildness who's glance no civilization can endure.</td>

 Parallel Language Support for Multigrid Algorithms Bradford L. Deitz, and Lawrence Snyder University of Washington Technical Report UW-CSE 99-11-03, 1999 PDF, PS Abstract. Multigrid algorithms are a computational paradigm that enjoy widespread use in the scientific community. While parallel multigrid algorithms have been in use for quite some time, parallel language support for features common to multigrid algorithms has been lacking. This forces scientists either to express their computations in high-level terms without knowing the parallel impact, or to explicitly manage all the details by hand, thereby diverting their attention from the algorithm itself.</td>
