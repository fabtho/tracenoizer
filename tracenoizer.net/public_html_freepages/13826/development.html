 . Experts from several media institutions including Steve Deitz of the Walker Art Center and Gabriele Blome of GMD National Research Center, presented research which challenged current understanding of networked culture. Among the main concerns were the development of archival systems for new media works, and the creation of intuitive GUI's for high volume databases. His research connects urban planning and traditional studies in architecture with the monitoring Internet traffic. As he pointed out, if we ever hope to learn from the wealth of knowledge being shared over the Internet, we need to start developing systems that can analyze traffic and generate meaningful data about to the type of communication taking place.</td>

 I still give directions at least once a week on how to select "All" to post to the entire listserv. They read a general posting and then respond to me directly. The human resource has been an important component to the general development and usage of our site. Student Involvement Student involvement emerged as the number one priority for the next phase of ArtsNet Minnesota development. We create wonderful curriculum websites, but do students and teachers use them.</td>

 The two projects presented in the current exhibition explore the Internet by searching the memory and probing the subconscious of the network. Reversing the standard view of the Internet as a reflection of the world, Wisniewski challenges the viewer to see what the Internet projects onto the world. Three slices of time will be arbitrarily selected by the artist from three different decades in the Internet's development. In three simultaneous live feeds, netomat will crawl the visible and invisible Internet and display what was created or modified at these moments in time and still remembered today. These include messages exchanged, news posted, documents published as well as log and error files.</td>
