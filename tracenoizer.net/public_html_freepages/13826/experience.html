 I earned my doctorate and embraced technology during the same time period. I flew, I crashed; I was in awe of the volume of accessible knowledge and I short circuited from the sheer number of variables in the equation. The entire journey made me feel ignorant, not a pleasant experience, considering I had just collected a doctorate. Using this personal experience as valuable data, the ArtsNet Minnesota project was approached with a clear understanding of problematic issues faced by educators interested in exploring the new learning model created by the Internet. In the spirit of collaboration, I hope this report may be useful in your quest to broaden constituency based accessibility to curriculum and art via the Internet (Eisner, 1991).</td>

 some Rauschenberg and Kienholz installations, I have seen --- but I understand the argument that you have to take care of your 100. As I mentioned in my former posting there is not only a lack in handling net-art by the visitor but also net-art does loose some of his impact - i. its intimacy (because many pieces are created for a 'private' experience. You have to credit these points when presenting such kind of art in a museum - i. by creating intimate places beside big presentation.</td>
