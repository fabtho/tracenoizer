 It is the pivotal standard around which there is a convergence of resource locators such as the Government Information Locator Service (GILS), and retrieval tools such as WAIS. 50 was based largely on its acceptance in the information network community. Introduction to the User Model Kody Janney and Jane Sledge met on April 24 and 25, 1995 to discuss user needs in accessing computerized museum information. For Project CHIO, CIMI has defined the user as the typical museum visitor who attends during regular opening hours, enters through the public entrances, and pays any required entry fee. This means that the project's emphasis for access to information is not placed on the needs of experts, scholars, or museum personnel, nor is it placed towards enticing those who are not currently museum visitors into the institutions.</td>

 Contemporary artists and "interfacers" have much to teach us about the potential of communication networks. For convenience and clarity I will continue to use the word museum though I find it problematic. The word museum evokes the 19th century model of collecting by state organizations. Embedded within the term museum are the economic and social histories of those establishments. The word museum carries with it the residue of traditional and often outmoded paradigms such as collecting and preserving objects from around the world, the architectural design of spaces for scientific study of collections, and to display the exotic to the public.</td>

 How does the interpretation of data and quality of information change in a digital environment. In other words, how much does the design of information space determine the type of communication taking place. As Steve Dietz pointed out, even in displaying web based work in physical spaces, we need to get away from the traditional model of beige boxes with keyboards on top of desks. Creating archives that chart our advances through networked space will only help us navigate through future possibilities more intelligently. And by designing information spaces with these values in mind, we might actually be able to put the democratic possibilities of the Internet to use.</td>
