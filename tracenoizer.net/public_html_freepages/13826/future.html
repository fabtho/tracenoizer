 But you will quickly find something tailored to your level of expertise. Shadow of an Informand Stuart Moulthrop's dynamic essay discusses the potential of hypertext for readers and writers. Politexts, Hypertexts, and Other Cultural Formations in the Late Age of Print "I have twisted the language to contrive the title of this essay because I want to interrogate the future of literacy both its electronic formations (if indeed these differ from its pre-electronic ones) and its social origins and effects. The elegance of the linking architecture in this piece is enviable. This community was founded to encourage new hypertext writers and artists.</td>
