 In fact, in the real world, when a consumer enters in a given merchant store it is with the intent to "buy" and not to "pay". Electronic commerce will not be enabled by "payment processing" solution if one does not attempt to provides existing services and garantees available to a consumer and a merchant in the real world. Securing all transactions steps One fundamental observation in commerce is that it is not sufficient for the merchants and the customers to have a secure payment system. The offer contains not only the requested price but also a sufficiently precise description of the offered good and some additional information such as delivery delay, warranty period, return policy, etc. A customer must pay the requested price but requires that the terms of the contract are fulfilled by the merchant.</td>
