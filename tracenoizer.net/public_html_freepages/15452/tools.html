 The results of the project are implemented in a prototype software system for evaluation by our industrial partners. This prototype is intended to be useful for consulting companies, software vendors that try to offer complete solutions for enterprise integration, and for organization units in major companies that analyze and design business processes. The primary advantage of the approach taken in the project is that the tools that are designed are generic for a wide range of applications. In order to ensure that the prototype achieves this goal, an advisory group has been created that is comprised of companies in the above areas and which provide direction to the research efforts. The role of this group is to evaluate existing tools for enterprise design and to propose necessary capabilities for new tools.</td>

 Also, in the new era of digital economy, it is no longer sufficient for organisations to rely on the use of piecemeal technologies, working in isolation and super-imposed on rigid structures and systems. Furthermore, the new information-based economy requires a real departure from a functionally-based modus operandi to one which is based on agility, flexibility, responsiveness and mass customisation. The effective achievement of this shift necessitates the consideration of broader aspects relating to managing strategies, relationships, processes and human resources through modern business process re-engineering and management tools. Everyone knows business process re-engineering and management can mean trouble. Like all good ideas, it can be applied wrongly by people who don't understand it.</td>
