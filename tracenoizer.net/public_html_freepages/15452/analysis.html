 This not only enables a precise formulation of the intuitions implicit in practice, but it is also a step towards automating the execution of certain tasks involved in enterprise engineering. The Enterprise Engineering system allows for the exploration of a variety of enterprise designs. The process of exploration is one of design, analysis and re-design, where the system not only provides a comparative analysis of enterprise design alternatives, but can also provide guidance to the designer. The process of design is performed through the creation, analysis and modification of the enterprise from within each of the perspective visualizations. Business process reengineering knowledge is currently descriptive, ad hoc, or pre-scientific.</td>

 What was different in the reengineering movement was its insistence on radical change and in advocacy of extreme measures to bring about much desired reforms. industrial corporations that had been festering for a long time. A wholesome by-product of this rush is the long overdue reinstatement of the primacy of business process analysis that was neglected during three decades of over-emphasis on computer systems and prior to that two decades of socio-psychological experimentation. It has also freed funds for innovative computer-aided business analysis tools which make business process improvement and systems analysis much easier to do. In fact, such strategies are already being applied by a number of government and private sector organizations successfully without the fanfare associated with BPR.</td>

 The greatest threat to the success of any IS project is the failure to communicate. This interview highlights the pros and cons of face-to-face and electronic communication with increasing project size and complexity. Risk assessment should include the opportunity cost of inaction or failure while doing a cost analysis of the project investment. Business Process Reengineering Analysis and Recommendations (Chu et al. ) A review of the BPR literature with an assessment of the princliples and assumptions behind BPR, successes and failures, case studies and theoretical alternatives.</td>
