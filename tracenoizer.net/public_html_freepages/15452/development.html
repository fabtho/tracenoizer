 It is unusual, however, for an environmental program to offer a strong education from both the technical and policy perspectives. This degree program offers students substantial technical and policy education on environmental issues. No nation can achieve this on its own; but together we can -- in a global partnership for sustainable development. That is, many traditional environmental issues are examined through the lens of sustainable development. The term sustainable development means choosing policies that balance environmental preservation and economic development so as to meet the needs of the present generation without compromising the neeeds of future generations.</td>

 Without such an archive, students five years from now run the risk of thinking the world began shortly after they were born. Such a room would provide commuters a place to come and relax during the day, off quiet repose for study and secure lockers for personal belongings. If you would like to join us in our plans for these exciting goals, please contact Winthrop University's Development Office or feel free to refer to the University Development Office web-site. For more information, please contact us at the library. .</td>
