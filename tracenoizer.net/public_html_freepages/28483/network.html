 . By using IntelliMirror on both the server and client, administrators can protect and manage user data and settings. Personalized data, applications, and settings can follow each user to different computers throughout the network. Administrators can easily replace faulty computers and restore all user data and settings on a new computer. Group Policy and the Active Directory are not necessary for every IntelliMirror feature.</td>

 This step-by-step guide describes scenarios that illustrate the benefits of User Data Management and User Settings Management. It is designed to help administrators understand how they can use these features in their organizations. People use computers when they are not connected to a network (the stand-alone state) or when they are connected to a network (the networked state). In the course of doing their jobs, people frequently transition between these two states. The IntelliMirror management technologies, and specifically User Data Management and User Settings Management, make it possible for people to get the most out of their computers.</td>
