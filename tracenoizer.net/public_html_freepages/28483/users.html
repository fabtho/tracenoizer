The technique used by these sites to monitor user visits could also be used by other Web sites, if users downloaded software that changed their computer settings slightly to allow the monitoring, he wrote.

 In the course of doing their jobs, people frequently transition between these two states. The IntelliMirror management technologies, and specifically User Data Management and User Settings Management, make it possible for people to get the most out of their computers. Data and settings follow users without regard to whether they are in the stand-alone state or connected to a network. The increased availability of user data and personal environments is a result of storing that information on network servers and in synchronized off-line locations on the local hard drive. Users can log on to any computer and have access to their own data and documents, their own preferences, and their own applications, without having to understand why it occurs.</td>
