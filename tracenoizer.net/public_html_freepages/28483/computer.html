 By using IntelliMirror on both the server and client, administrators can protect and manage user data and settings. Personalized data, applications, and settings can follow each user to different computers throughout the network. Administrators can easily replace faulty computers and restore all user data and settings on a new computer. Group Policy and the Active Directory are not necessary for every IntelliMirror feature. Some of the features can be set on the local level or through local polices.</td>

 Data and settings follow users without regard to whether they are in the stand-alone state or connected to a network. The increased availability of user data and personal environments is a result of storing that information on network servers and in synchronized off-line locations on the local hard drive. Users can log on to any computer and have access to their own data and documents, their own preferences, and their own applications, without having to understand why it occurs. IntelliMirror Features This document is based on the common infrastructure that will allow you to learn about and evaluate these new features, and think about the manner in which you will use them in your organization. There are several ways an administrator can make data follow its user.</td>
