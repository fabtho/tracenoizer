 THE MURKY MUCK OF compassionate conservatism is clearing up, and the emerging picture isn't always pretty. Bush's public statements so far in support of criminalizing gay sex, for example, reveal that his views aren't very compassionate. The statements are all the more important as a signal about Bush's attitude toward gays because, although numerous states still have laws that forbid sodomy, only a handful aim solely at gay sex the way the Texas law does. To be fair to Bush, he inherited his state's anti-gay sodomy law. Although it's been around for decades in one form or another, the current version was adopted by a Democratic state legislature in 1993 as part of a comprehensive overhaul of the state penal code.</td>
