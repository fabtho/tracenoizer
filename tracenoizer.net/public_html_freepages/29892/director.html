 " The goal of the unique Internet project is to raise money to help feed the homeless, and provide funds for treatment for the addicted, at The Capuchin Soup Kitchen and Jefferson House in Detroit, MI. The project is an online auction of documentary photographs taken by the photographers and is the idea of Brother Vincent Reyes, O. Capuchin, the pastoral director of the Capuchin Soup Kitchen. Reyes describes the project this way, "Visions of the Sacred" celebrates documentary photojournalism while raising money. The money raised by the sale of the photographs at auction will help the same people who are often the subjects of documentary photojournalism.</td>
