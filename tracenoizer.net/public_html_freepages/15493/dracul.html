 I have a sister, her name is Babet ( VvBabettvV ) and two half sisters, Rudaroctka and Singsloud. . I am the recently widowed wife of Sir Vlad Dracul, the father of Count Dracula. As a child, I played every morning in my yard with my nanny. Well, one October morning, she went inside to fetch me my sweater , for it was chilly out.</td>
