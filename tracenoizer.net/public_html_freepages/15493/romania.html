 The majority of its people are Romanians, but about a quarter of the population are Magyars (Hungarians). Magyars make up the largest ethnic group in Hungary. The Carpathian Mountains and Transylvanian Alps separate the region from the rest of Romania. For years, Romanians and Hungarians quarreled over Transylvania. From 1526 to 1699, Transylvania was part of the Ottoman (Turkish) Empire.</td>

 Wandering shepards in Transylvania ; The beautiful Carpathians This has always been a land of great controversy. To the Romanians, this was the heartland of ancient Dacia, whose fierce tribesmen first fought the Romans, and then intermarried with them after the Roman conquest to form what is today the Romanian race. Since the award of this land to Romania in 1920 under the terms of the Trianon Treaty, the treatment of minority Hungarians here has always been the constant source of tension between Hungary and Romania. With the downfall of communism, this tension has become more apparent, with nationalistic leaders on both sides demanding for extreme solutions to the problem. For a traveller from afar like me, the problems are apparent on the train to Romania - even before crossing the border.</td>
