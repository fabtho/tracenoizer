The purpose of the software is to give the students the motivation and the knowledge to reduce and eventually remove the scaffolding provided to the point where they are able to design and write their own simple programs.

Another thing that students will learn will be how to communicate and collaborate over the Internet.">

 Choose from technical and management seminars designed exclusively for Information Systems Professionals What is ISE and Why Should We Attend. Thousands of information systems professionals from over 100 separate organizations have benefited from the training provided through the NC State Information Systems Education (ISE) series over the past 20 years. Through practical, real-world content and instruction, our schedule of management, technical and programming short courses will provide participants with new skills and knowledge that they can use to increase their productivity and their value to the company. The instructors for the ISE series have been carefully selected for both their knowledge and their teaching ability, guaranteeing that you and your people will get the type of training experience you want and need. Each separate program is one to five days in length to cover the topic thoroughly, but also to be mindful of the value and importance of time to the participants.</td>

 Reactions and assays will be conducted using pooled groups and on individual animals; the latter will provide a measure of the inter-individual variability. Extension of the project's scope may even be suitable for a Ph. Knowledge, skills and abilities in analytical chemistry, particularly in HPLC will be highly advantageous. It is expected that a graduate student, devoting approximately 20 hours per week in the laboratory can complete the project within three-four semesters. The completed work will result in several publications with the student as a co-author.</td>
