The Faculty of Management admits 510 students into the Bachelor of Commerce program each academic year. Admission is competitive, based on the academic performance of the five most recent full-course equivalents completed (University of Calgary courses and transferable courses taken at other post-secondary institutions). All grades within a session will be included except where the number of courses taken within a session exceeds that required to fulfil five full course equivalents in which case the highest grades will be used.

 The library is done with shifting materials around to accommodate construction; therefore, students should be able to find what they need easily. Hale offers many resources for students besides books. The library has computer workstations for research and archives of historical articles related to the university, test files, and a copy center. All can be used by any K-State student with a valid university ID. K-State faculty, staff and even students from other Kansas universities are also welcome to use these facilities.</td>
