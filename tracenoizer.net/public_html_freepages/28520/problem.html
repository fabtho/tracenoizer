 If so, how could that possibly make a difference, since fTree is a pointer. It really appears that there is a bug in TTree somewhere. Unless someone can point out a problem with the example TSelector that I attached, I can't imagine any other conclusion. I would be happy to provide any other information to track down and solve this problem. .</td>

However, since completion of the remodeling of Hale last October, the library has become easier for students to use. "The main problem that we see is that a lot of students are afraid to ask questions," Laurel Littrell, humanities reference librarian, said. "We're here to help them, and they should feel free to come up to us and ask about anything. " Students also shouldn't worry about trying to find materials that seem to keep disappearing on them.</td>
