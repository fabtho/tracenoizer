 . The students are expected to be familiar with a computer but have no prior programming experience. The purpose of the software is to give the students the motivation and the knowledge to reduce and eventually remove the scaffolding provided to the point where they are able to design and write their own simple programs. Students will also learn how to organize their thoughts and ideas into a program design before actually trying to code, and will learn to comment what they do. Another thing that students will learn will be how to communicate and collaborate over the Internet.</td>

 Assuming that the only entities the programmer wanted to use were supported Genie data types, it would have been easier to code a program in Genie. If the program needed only a few features not available in Genie, it would have been possible to code a program in Genie with additional functionality added in AP2. AP1 would only have been necessary to get Genie implemented and to write programs which extensively used features of the machine not supported by Genie, such as the Mode Light Register. The assembler would also have been used to write programs which bypassed SPIREL entirely and ran on the bare hardware. Graduate students Joel Cyprus and Dwayne Chesnut completed their Ph.</td>
