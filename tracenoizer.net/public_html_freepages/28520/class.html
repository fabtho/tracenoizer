 I would be happy to provide any other information to track down and solve this problem. . The class that I sent you compiles (and runs) perfectly. As I mentioned, I followed the example in the files h1analysis. The only difference is that I am not using the fancier features that the h1analysis example uses (i.</td>

 Students were then introduced to SuperLink and began designing an interactive autobiography as they learned SuperLink commands. Planning and problem-solving were required in transforming what students know about themselves into an interesting and interactive computer program. Students learned SuperLink commands in small chunks, each class adding a new feature to their autobiography, until eventually a larger, more complex program was created. Students also learned to use SuperLink Paint, a drawing program, which allowed them to import their own artwork into their autobiographies. Our next project will incorporate a combination of SuperLink programming with the third grade study of rivers.</td>
