 Human ageing is a slow process, and for this reason researchers have often made productive use of organisms such as fruitflies, which have short lifespans and can be manipulated in large numbers. Cancer is one of the major diseases associated with human ageing, and the mechanism by which age-related cancers may form is the topic of a further review. A concluding commentary article outlines the future prospects for research on ageing, and the implications that the fruits of this research may have for our society. ..</td>
