 I became a committed part of his study group, figuring I could not lose whether the theory held or proved faulty. I'd spent eight years working out on Korzybski's general semantics, and felt ready for a new challenge. What began that day became a continuing process of personal healing for me and the direct catalyst for development of a spectrum of process theory-based facilitation tools and conceptual models for others. While I have discovered the limitations of the theory, it has not "broken. " In fact it "flies" as flexibly as the helicopter he invented so long ago.</td>
