 This question you raise makes me rethink how I want to come across, because, alas, the feminine voice is usually perceived as less professional or powerful. Once I've had an actual conversation, people invariably sense my authenticity -- but I wonder how many prospective clients I might have missed because of my writing style. I have also found different responses between males and females to colors, the way questions are asked, and the way goals are set and acted upon. Women's talk shows have coined the word in the last 10 years to refer to females, but I don't see it as feminine. When I read magazines, books, and marketing copy, I just don't see the writing as gender specific.</td>
