 In accordance with modern mineralization theory and expert knowledge,the multidisciplinary evaluation method was abstracted based on GIS. Each mineralizing factor is distinguished and seized with quantitative analyzing process. The important and significant mineralization areas can be drawn frOm analuzing results of the cure and method system by information recognition and multidisciplinary evaluation. The application significance has been shown in Arjin-East Konglong Area. Experiments show that the percentage of cobalt deposited increases with increasing bath composition and current density.</td>
