 This has led to an explosion of handbooks and management manuals designed to give nonprofit leaders tools to improve their operations (Light 2000). As a consequence, the successful nonprofit manager must constantly work to find ways to sustain the myriad of complex personal relationships that together allow a nonprofit organization to pursue its mission. While all nonprofits would like to develop long-term organizational plans and improve management practices, a harried agency director may, more often than not, be drawn to focus on the more immediate objective of simply making it through the day and keeping the organization afloat. Funders are increasingly selective in their awarding of gifts and grants to nonprofits. Underfinanced and duplicative nonprofit organizations must now contend with the inability of private funders to finance completely the explosive growth of this sector.</td>

 Among those that have felt the pain are Flashcom, NorthPoint Communications and Covad Communications. PSINet had previously announced that its cash, and other investments that can easily be converted to cash, are not enough to help it meet its anticipated monetary needs. PSINet is still trying to find ways to remain afloat, including selling parts of the company and restructuring its debt. The company also announced its board had formed a restructuring committee to streamline the company's restructuring efforts. PSINet earlier hired Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein and Goldman Sachs as financial advisers.</td>
