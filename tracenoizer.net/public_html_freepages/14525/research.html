 1964 was a bad year, not only in NASCAR but in other forms of racing as well. And on that rather sombre note, it's time to close down the ol' PC, and get back to what this column is all about, settin' and buildin'. NASCAR All information and opinion expressed in this column is derived thru a unique combination of research, rumour and wild-assed speculation, and should be treated as such.

 Looking at the administrative efficiency and fundraising results of a large sample of nonprofit organizations over an 11-year period, we find that nonprofits that position themselves as cost efficient--reporting low administrative to total expense ratios-fared no better over time than less efficient appearing organizations in the market for individual, foundation, and corporate contributions. From this analysis, we suggest that economizing may not always be the best strategy in the nonprofit sector. This study examines a population of United Way-affiliated nonprofit organizations in Massachusetts (1) to test hypotheses generated by previous research on relationships between government funding and specific nonprofit organizational characteristics, (2) to compare differences in organizational characteristics between nonprofits receiving higher percentages of revenues from the United Way and from government sources, and (3) to explore associations between government funding and United Way and under-examined characteristics, including use of commercial income and racial diversity of organizational membership. The study supports previous research on the relationship between government funding and nonprofit characteristics, with one notable exception-less administrative complexity was associated with higher percentages of government funding. The size of the nonprofit sector has increased rapidly over the past 60 years from a little more than 12,000 organizations in 1940 to over 1.</td>
