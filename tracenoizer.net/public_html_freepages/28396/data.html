 This only applies to real Mirabilis clients as all of the ICQ clones, including STRICQ, will allow anyone to be added to the contact list regardless of the state of this option. This simply replaces the current info with what was last saved to disk. The only time this button is needed is when the data in one of the Textinput gadgets on the user info tabs is manually changed. It also will apply to the specific prefs settings for the UIN the user window belongs to in a future version of STRICQ. The only time a user's info is pulled from the server is when the UIN Search window is used.</td>

 While Normal Level can be considered an estimate of an individual's over-all capability, its importance to PAS, for the purpose of this introduction, is that it provides a baseline from which the influence of personality on test performance can be quantitatively measured. The PAS does not use a normative baseline from which to assess subtest scatter. Subtest deviation scores are, in the PAS, ipsitive data, not normative data. The method of computing Normal Level is discussed in another section of this Web site. Dimensionality of the PAS and the Levels of Development There are three major and six derived dimensions within the system.</td>
