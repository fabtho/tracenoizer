 In 1995 Daniel stated a new project with Stitt and he composed a String quartet which was premiered in October 1995 at The Burgh House in Hampstead, thanks to the help of his composer friend Stewart Lane. Images and recollections of the past pervade the meditative atmosphere of the first movement. This asymmetrical time signature gives the impression of relentless progression somewhat thwarted because of its slightly inconclusive nature. ' (extract from the programme notes) In 1997 Ceasefire, Akshun records with Andre Stitt was released. Some very promising tracks have been recorded but have yet to be released.</td>
