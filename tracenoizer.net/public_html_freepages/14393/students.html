 I seek to cultivate students who know how to think critically, read carefully and write clearly, students who are culturally and theoretically literate, and who have learned to value the sense of excitement that learning entails. . What I aim to do through teaching is to provide students with a vocabulary for better understanding their complex relationships to the world they inhabit. If these are immodest aims, it is in part because my main area of study, postcolonial feminism, is a politically uncompromising field which aims to do no less than repair the damage wrought by the collaborative forces of colonialism and patriarchy. I do not see these as distant historical processes; rather, I believe that my students and I live in the world that colonialism built, and that we have complicated relations of complicity with and resistance to that regime.</td>

But while his career as a clinician is firmly established, the showman in him lives on, as evidenced by his unconventional approach to precepting P-4 students. Well, there's his signature offbeat humor which includes lavish use of metaphor to illustrate points. And his tendency to draw parallels between lessons in American history and the daily struggles of pharmacists.</td>
