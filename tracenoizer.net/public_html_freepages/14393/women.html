 I would pass your letter off as a harmless exercise - just you, idly stretching your powers of imagination - but that would be too easy. Clearly, you're going through a mid-life crisis, Ed, and it's bringing many of your deep-seated fears and insecurities to the surface. Many men fear that without their physical strength and unfaltering sex drive, they will not appeal to women. Women will see them not as swarthy pirates anxious to tear at their bodices, but as soft little wussies or wilty little flowers. But don't be so certain that women have a problem with soft, squeezable men.</td>

 Lee Drury, Cruise Director, World Explorer Cruises As an art instructor who teaches beginning level design, I recently arranged a tour of a local quilt exhibition for my students. Heather's discussion of how traditional and non-traditional techniques, patterns and images have broadened the definition of contemporary quilt making opened the student's eyes to the complexity and skill in this art form. Although quilts have been considered a "craft made by women" in the past, Heather was able to help the students see beyond this stereotype and identify how the act of designing and sewing a quilt is the same creative process as designing and creating any work of art. I am grateful to Heather for her articulate expertise and commend her for her ability to share her knowledge with others. com 15235 Gibralter Road Anacortes, Washington 98221 Phone (360) 293-8349 Fax (360) 299-2567 .</td>
