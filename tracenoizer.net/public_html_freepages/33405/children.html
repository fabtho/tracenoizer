 Teresa of Avila Saint Teresa was born in Avila, Spain, March 28, 1515. Her family origins have been traced to Toledo and Olmedo. Juan transferred his business to Avila, where he succeeded in having his children marry into families of the nobility. In 1505 Alonso married Catalina del Peso, who bore him two children and died in 1507. Two years later Alonso married the 15-year-old Beatriz de Ahumada of whom Teresa was born.</td>

Every day in Britain happy, popular children who do well at school are being murdered by evil paedophile scum. We want the law changed to make it illegal to murder children and bury them in woodland.</td>
