 A best-seller made into a major film in 1965, it tells of the ocean voyage of a group of Germans back to their homeland from Mexico in 1931, on the eve of Hitler's ascendency. Porter's carefully crafted, ironic style is perfectly suited to the allegorical exploration of the collusion of good and evil that is her theme, and the penetrating psychological insight that had always marked her work is evident in the book. Porter's Collected Short Stories (1965) won the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize for fiction. Her essays, articles, and book reviews are collected in The Days Before (1952; augmented 1970). Porter died on September 18, 1980, in Silver Spring, Maryland.</td>
