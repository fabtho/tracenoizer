 I skateboard sometimes although I'm not that great. I hate snow, I really hate snowmen (childhood memory. ) I seem cruel when I go outside and knock over poor defenceless snowmen, but there are not good things. I cry on highways when the car goes in between two. Anyone who runs around starting rumors should have their tongue chopped out.</td>

 All my fellow Brothers (and a Sister) are in a meeting, that I don't need to be in, and as there weren't enough chairs, I opted out. But I need brother Cristof to introduce me to the right IT people here, so I can get the pissy little component I developed installed, only he's in the meeting. I tried writing a list of things-to-do, only that got boring very quickly. So I tried doing some drawings, but that's not a good idea. If a client sees a contractor sitting around and doing drawings, they tend to think I might not have anything to do.</td>
