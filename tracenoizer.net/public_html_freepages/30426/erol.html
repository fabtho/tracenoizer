Guitarist Erol Unala and programmer Donovan John Szypura challenge the frontrunners of the genre with innovative loops and sounds that weave intricately into the strength of song. Indeed, as a final testimony to this idea of collage, the band finished the record and then remixed the album's first two tracks to add "color and dimension" to the final assemblage.
