 - YEAR END 2001 ACTIVITIES Further songwriting and demo sessions are currently in progress at Apollyon Sun's own rehearsal studio facility (where the band have just upgraded the computer-based recording system) and at Oakland Recording, the band's long-time home when recording in Switzerland. A number of musical guests from both sides of the Atlantic has already participated. Some of the material written this year for the new AS album will still undergo significant development, other songs have been recorded to final album standards. All material is being circulated on a variety of work-in-progress CDs within the AS camp and for AS industry associates, and we have decided to make some of this material available via the website. Erol Unala and Tom Gabriel Fischer are also currently involved with extensive preparation work for another musical project, which, if it will bear fruit, will be of major significance.</td>

 Best described as hypnotic, giving it a very industrial feel. Yes, you could say "Evil Pop" is the perfect description. Throughout this 5 track MCD Apollyon Sun show flair and imagination that not only makes this a must have, but with the full length album 'Sub' due for release early next year promising to be even more adventurous. While for sheer power and aggression, top marks go to 'Reefer Boy' and 'The Cane', the slower of the two 'Reefer Boy' has a real industrial feel to it, while 'The Cane' is a more manic affair with Fischer's vocals to the fore. 'Concrete Satan', my favourite of the set has a wonderful intro featuring some ace programming, a fine bass line while the rest of the song features some fine guitar work, possibly the most metal track on the album.</td>
