 What becomes very clear whilst listening to God Leaves (And Dies) is that Apollyon Sun have merged to combine all the good modern technology without losing that metal feel. . Bedlam And Blind Some of you may remember that Tom Gabriel Fischer was the main driving force behind the band Celtic Frost, who have to rank as one of the most underrated bands of our time, only now is the Frost's avante garde style of metal getting the appreciation it deserves. In laymans terms that means combining all thats good about the undergrouns scene with stabbing riffs, dark melodies, thundering bass lines, first rate synth work all rounded off with Fischer's own style of vocals. Best described as hypnotic, giving it a very industrial feel.</td>
