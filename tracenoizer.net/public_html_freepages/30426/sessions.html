 .5 mac, please press apple-t to remove sidebar, otherwise everything is pushed 20px to the right. - YEAR END 2001 ACTIVITIES Further songwriting and demo sessions are currently in progress at Apollyon Sun's own rehearsal studio facility (where the band have just upgraded the computer-based recording system) and at Oakland Recording, the band's long-time home when recording in Switzerland. A number of musical guests from both sides of the Atlantic has already participated. Some of the material written this year for the new AS album will still undergo significant development, other songs have been recorded to final album standards.</td>
