<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" Progressing through the album and feeling the cyclonic pull of Fischer's history, one is nevertheless relentlessly driven forward into a new age. Guitarist Erol Unala and programmer Donovan John Szypura challenge the frontrunners of the genre with innovative loops and sounds that weave intricately into the strength of song. Indeed, as a final testimony to this idea of collage, the band finished the record and then remixed the album's first two tracks to add "color and dimension" to the final assemblage. "But if anything, we are much more raw and high-energy live. There are two guitars, and in addition to bass and drum samples, there are also live bass and live drums.">

 An improved alternative solution is currently being prepared, and we expect that the online merchandising will go live in the near future. AS are currently planning to make available some of the work-in-progress material being written and recorded for the next AS album. A CD containing four or five tracks from sessions recorded earlier this year will be part of the forthcoming merchandise selection. The CD will feature custom-made artwork and full liner credits. The online music player on the website has also been updated to showcase parts of newly-written songs.</td>
