 Back to Top Students With Disabilities The University of Rochester is committed to making its programs and services accessible to people with disabilities. To allow time for appropriate action to be taken, we urge students to notify the University early of their needs. Students with disabilities should call the Office of the Dean of Students, 275-4085 (voice or TDD) or visit the Dean of Students Office in 510 Wilson Commons. Students with learning disabilities wishing accommodations need to provide appropriate documentation of their disability as determined by a licensed psychologist to the Director of Learning Assistance in 107 Lattimore Hall (phone 275-9049) prior to the beginning of classes. For further information, contact the Office of the Dean of Students, at 275-4085 (voice or TDD).</td>

 The Director of Assessment and Institutional Research serves as a member of the University Cabinet, Planning Advisory Committee, Enrollment Planning Committee, and Research Council. This exposure ensures that the research function serves the specific needs of the University as related to program reviews, policy reviews, and appraisal of purpose. The Office of Assessment and Institutional Research gathers data and transforms these data into information that is then disseminated to University administrators, facilitating academic analysis and decision making. Institutional Research services are available to administrators, faculty, staff, and students for planning and management activities as well as to persons and agencies outside the university. The office responds promptly to requests for data and initiates studies to improve university governance and management.</td>
