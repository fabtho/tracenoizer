 A QuickTime Settings window will open with two transport settings to choose from. The next time you access a streaming media file, it should connect and play fine. The most common are too many users attempting to access a streaming media file; a user's local Internet service provider is experiencing unusually heavy traffic; or the path to the streaming media file may contain a broken link or an otherwise invalid file structure.
