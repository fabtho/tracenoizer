 SOAP encoding is based on XML Schemas and as such it closely models many of the standard types and constructs that developers would be familiar with. . We need to know the rules for representing an integer, string, or floating point number in a SOAP message so that we can exchange messages freely between languages and platforms. The serialization of data inside a SOAP message is referred to as encoding. As this section focuses on the payload of the message, the XML in the examples represents only a SOAP message payload and not a complete message.</td>
