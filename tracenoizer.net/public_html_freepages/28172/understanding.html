 A unit test is not provided in the test and quiz book due to the fact that the teacher will write a unit test based upon the results of the quizzes and tests. Each quiz and test supplied in the Total Health curriculum is designed to accommodate different learning styles. Do not grade too harshly on the format but more on the content, grammar, spelling, and depth of understanding. If students know what to expect, they are more likely to succeed. The standard tests and quizzes supplied are neither too easy or too hard.</td>

 This is the most extensive set of interpretations published to date and includes delineations on the Trans-Pluto, Magi Crown, Moon, Phoenix and Synastry positions. With this book, you will not only know what a Card means in each position, but also why it means that, as well. This is really more than just a beginning level series and should be more accurately classified as a foundation book, as it builds a foundational understanding of the System, which allows one to ascend quickly and easily to an Intermediate Level of use. As you get more comfortable with the method outlined in the book, you will be able to fill out a Chart in a few minutes and really be at an early Advanced Level with the System. Learn at a glance important information regarding all the areas of your life; money, career, travel, success and love.</td>
