For the rest he teaches Communications 101, 'Communication Skills', and Communications 201, 'Advanced Communication Skills'. ' His own opinion, which he does not air, is that the origins of speech lie in song, and the origins of song in the need to fill out with sound the overlarge and rather empty human soul. In the past few years he has been playing with the idea of a work on Byron. At first he had thought it would be another book, another critical opus.">
