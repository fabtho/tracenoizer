 The company Bush most wanted to work for after graduation, Proctor and Gamble, rejected him. After interviewing with several other companies, Bush used his family connections to get a job. Before becoming senator from Connecticut (1952-1963), Prescott was the longest-sitting member of the board of directors of Dresser Industries, a Dallas-based oil drilling equipment supply company. Instead of taking those two prospects, George opted for a third family tie. He met with Henry Neil Mallon, the president of Dresser Industries.</td>
