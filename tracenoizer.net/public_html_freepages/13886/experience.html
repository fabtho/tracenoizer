<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" About fifteen years ago, a religious community was visited by the Superior General from Rome. Sociologists and religious educators define a family as a group of people who consider themselves bound to each other by enduring ties in shared responsibility for the well-being, growth, and support of one another. For a Christian, whether of the domestic or monastic "type," this is a religious experience. This home will reveal itself in an atmosphere or environment where we give ourselves to truly listen to authority; where authority learns to ask forgiveness for not listening; where we learn to respect and encourage the sacred in others rather than to limit or belittle it, and where we delight in the riches of each other when we approach one another with empty hands.
