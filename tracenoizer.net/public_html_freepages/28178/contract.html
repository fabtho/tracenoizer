On May 21, US Airways informed the FAA that it is temporarily lowering its crew pairing policy from 100 hours to 75 hours for a period of six months, effective June 1. Chairman Bryan stated that either improper planning or an attempt to reduce boughttrips might have lead to this shortage, but certainly not the pilots' contract. ALPA was not informed of the letter to the FAA in advance, and only recently became aware of this reduction. ALPA is preparing a formal response to this matter.">

 Primary Manufacturer Telex is a primary manufacturer with 16 wholly owned manufacturing facilities around the world. This gives us tight control over product quality and delivery. Most competitors in this product category use contract manufacturing making them one step removed from controlling quality and delivery while adding an additional margin layer. Telex is a reliable supplier of high quality products that are competitively priced. First in Computer Microphones Telex was the first company to develop specialized microphones for PC voice applications starting in 1993.</td>

 No, the new law establishes a standard daily rate so that all days throughout the school year will be paid at the same daily rate. No, the new law allows prepayments, so teachers can be paid the monthly amount on the salary schedule on a fixed date each month (set by the local board) even though they might have worked a few days less in a month. It will even out by the end of the year if the teacher work the full contract. Only Sunday is specified as a day on which school cannot be held. There are no specific days which must be holidays for teachers, although the number of holidays for teachers must equal the number of holidays given to state employees.</td>

 Needless to say, ALPA will vigorously protest this improper interpretation. In a letter to management, I noted that management was fully aware that ALPA provided them with the ability to train MetroJet pilots on the mainline. While planning, expense, and crew shortages may be factors in this decision, the ALPA contract was not. Let us hope that this ill-considered endeavor is not a precursor to events in the upcoming training crunch. I recently expressed my concerns to management about the level of crew shortages and their impact upon our membership.</td>
