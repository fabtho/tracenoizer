 But I KNOW she's looking forward to her knight in shining armor again this year. Plan for area events going on at that time, although all you're doing is marking the days down, not what you're doing on them. Once you've got 6 months worth of days cleared with YOUR schedule and any timed events (concerts, etc), check the "family calendar" (you must have one) to see if it's a good day or not. If you are inviting friends, invite them WELL in advance. If they have to change or want to change the day, just tell them another time would be better.</td>
