ALPA is preparing a formal response to this matter. Due to the Company's reduction in staff positions in the Simulator Scheduling Department, routine requests from pilots to protect days off prior to the scheduling of recurrent training may not be serviced in a timely manner.

 A school board may delegate all or a portion of their days to the schools. NCAE believes that site-based decision-making is the best process to use for determining the use of these days. No longer should a school board or principal "protect" days for teachers who are not required to be in attendance. This law gives great flexibility to the administration to require a teacher to be there when his or her attendance is needed, but also, it allows the teacher to have greater opportunity to use earned annual leave when their attendance is not needed. A school board should not protect a day for all teachers unless they need all teachers there.</td>

 A letter from MEC Chairman Jon Bryan was mailed out to all US Airways pilots today. The Association has requested expedited consideration of this grievance and will pursue expedited arbitration if necessary. The MEC Training Committee is advising pilots to call Simulator Scheduling as early as possible to protect days off and not wait until the end of SAP to make these requests. If you are unable to contact a simulator scheduler, you should leave your choices with a hotel reservations scheduler in the Training Department. Due to crew shortages, ALPA has received a significant increase in the amount of calls from pilots reporting that Crew Scheduling was assigning trips on days off and out of base flying.</td>
