 The Association will continue to provide information, support and assistance to ensure that members understand how the changes in the school calendar provisions affect their paychecks, professional development and work schedules. The following information highlights areas in the calendar and provisions that have raised questions from NCAE members. Full funding of the new school calendar provisions will allow teachers who end the school year with more than 30 days to convert to sick leave or be paid. If the legislature does not fully fund the new calendar provisions, NCAE has an agreement with legislative leaders to restore the ten-month restriction. (what does that mean - 10 month restriction) If you attend professional development activities on Saturdays or within an 11 month period, you could count those days toward your 200 days of employment.</td>

 In fact, we turned Christmas shopping into a date night. But I KNOW she's looking forward to her knight in shining armor again this year. Plan for area events going on at that time, although all you're doing is marking the days down, not what you're doing on them. Once you've got 6 months worth of days cleared with YOUR schedule and any timed events (concerts, etc), check the "family calendar" (you must have one) to see if it's a good day or not. If you are inviting friends, invite them WELL in advance.</td>
