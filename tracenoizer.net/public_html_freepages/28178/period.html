 Full funding of the new school calendar provisions will allow teachers who end the school year with more than 30 days to convert to sick leave or be paid. If the legislature does not fully fund the new calendar provisions, NCAE has an agreement with legislative leaders to restore the ten-month restriction. (what does that mean - 10 month restriction) If you attend professional development activities on Saturdays or within an 11 month period, you could count those days toward your 200 days of employment. This should give teachers more flexibility to use earned vacation leave. See "Best Practices for Calendar Development" article on the back page of INFO and "SDPI Responds to Frequently Asked Questions" below for more information on the school calendars.</td>

 . On Wednesday, June 17, the MEC Grievance Committee filed an MEC grievance (MEC 98-06-11) against the Company seeking relief from the Company's misinterpretation and misapplication the US2 Letter of Agreement. This grievance is a result of the Company's decision to unilaterally assign additional duties to MetroJet (US2) pilots and ordering these pilots to perform post flight walkarounds at the conclusion of the pilots' last fight in a duty period. The Company made this decision despite ALPA's protests during meetings of the MetroJet Task Force and subsequent objections against this attempt to assign additional duties without proper compensation. The Association has requested expedited consideration of this grievance and will pursue expedited arbitration if necessary.</td>
