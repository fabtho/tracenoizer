 The Biography of Vlad III Dracula the Impaler (1431-1476) Dracula was born in 1431 in the Transylvanian city of Sighisoara (old latin Castrum Rex). At that time Dracula's father, Vlad II Dracul, was living in exile in Transylvania. Vlad Dracul was in Transylvania attempting to gather support for his planned effort to seize the Wallachian throne from the Danesti Prince, Alexandru I. The house where dracula was born is still standing in the citadel of Sighisoara. In 1431 it was located in a prosperous neighborhood surrounded by the homes of Saxon and Magyar merchants and the townhouses of the nobility.</td>
