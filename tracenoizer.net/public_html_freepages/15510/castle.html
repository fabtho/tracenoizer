 Vlad immediately had all the assembled guests arrested on the spot. The older boyars and their families were immediately impaled. The younger ones and their families were marched north from Tirgoviste to the ruins of a castle in the mountains above the Arges River.

They were forced to continue on even though their clothes fell from their bodies and they were naked.</td>

Vlad Dracul blamed the local nobles or boyars for the deaths of his father and brother. One Easter he invited all boyars and their families to dine with him at the palace.</td>
