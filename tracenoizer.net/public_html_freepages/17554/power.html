 The vibrations from Home are now being pulled through many vehicles on your Gameboard. We are very honored to tell you that it is no longer necessary to pass from physical form to experience the feelings and vibrations of Home. You have called this to you, for it was your greatest outcome to re-member your own power of creation and create Home on your side of the veil. This has begun and we are so very proud to call you our family of Light. continued Breathe deeply and relax as we journey together.</td>

 In the 5th dimension, point of perception determines reality. The time lag of creation in the 5th dimension is very short. All that is necessary for you to hold your power is to hold the responsibility of your own power. Understand that in the 5th dimension, if you do not like what you see in your reality, that you have the power and the responsibility to change it. Here it is your task to create the highest and the best for yourselves and dare to place yourself first in the energy flow.</td>
