 Characters who plan an extended trance require intravenous nourishment. In rage, the character is less oblivious to her surroundings than a Jedi in emptiness. For example, any physical contact by a living being may revive them (the Jedi must make a Moderate control roll) and provoke an instant berserker-like attack, regardless of who the person is. A character using rage can choose to anticipate the arrival of a foe. She must make a Difficult sense roll (modified by relationship) with the life sense power at the time he enters rage.</td>
