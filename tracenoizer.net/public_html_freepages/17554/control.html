 Emulate the Universal Energy as it seeks the Unity and find the common ground with all of your neighbors. Changing the point from which you view something changes the reality. You have much more control over your environment than you can see at this time. Set your intent to view everything from its highest perspective. Seek a daily attitude that will allow all energy to find its own balance and blend naturally of its own accord.</td>

 And so, let us say that something like an electrical fence -- frequency fence -- was put around the planet. Some of you have seen what your technological scientifics have created an electrical fence that you can keep animals with in. So it is that the electrical fence was put around your planet -- as a control as to how much the frequencies of the humans could be modulated and changed. So, as the story goes -- this frequency was set around the planet, and it was made very difficult for frequencies of Light frequencies of information to penetrate. And, when these Light frequencies were able to penetrate the frequency control, who was there to receive them.</td>
