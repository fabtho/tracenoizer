 Set your intent to go in opposition to this flow and all will be a struggle. The most effective tool we can give you to allow yourself to be in the Universal flow is through the Release. In the river of Universal Energy, many of you are clinging to the shoreline with your belief systems. Even though those beliefs may have gotten you this far, they can often keep you from advancing further down the river to the higher truths that await. Many of you have carved out very familiar places along the shoreline from which to play the game.</td>

 In most instances minor adjustment do not need to be formally controlled and the integrity of the process can be protected against failure by fixing critical standards including safety tollerances within the process. The sorts of processes that impact on product safety are those that require a reappraisal of the safety tollerances because they introduce new risk factors e. Inclusion of inherently risky ingredients Cooking Freezing and thawing Acidification Fermentation Drying Materials movement (cross contamination) Container closure Storage systems HACCP is the de facto standard for assessing food safety hazards and its principles can be applied to process development projects very effectively. Other risk assessment and design tools may also be useful and industry codes of practice provide a distilation of industry knowledge into clear understandable guidelines. For help with process control, equipment installation or process development issues send a message to john.</td>
