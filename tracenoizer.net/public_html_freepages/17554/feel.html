 However, whenever the character is injured again, the Jedi must make a new control pain roll, with thedifficulty being the new level of injury. This power can also be used to shrug off anystun results. However, the character is still injured, and thus is prone to getting worse, even if the Jedi doesn't feel thepain. For example, a wounded character who is wounded again would still become incapacitated. Mortallywounded Jedi still have to make the same rolls as other mortally wounded characters.</td>

 After a civil divorce (1980) she was remarried on June 13, 1981. Only a nominal Christian, without contact with her Orthodox Church, she did not even know that her remarriage could be the source of problems. When she presented herself to her church to regularize her marriage, the first priest to whom she spoke could not even seem to feel that there was a problem since it was a mixed marriage. But she insisted, in order to be truly in accord with Orthodox legislation. It was then that she was referred to the priest in charge of marriage problems, and it was he who took care of the matter following the 'law of economy' that deals with broken marriages in her church.</td>
