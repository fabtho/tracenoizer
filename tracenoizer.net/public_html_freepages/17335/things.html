 . Alan Lakey documents trashed hotel rooms, sexual ambiguity, infighting - and a host of remarkable albums filled with some of the greatest music of the era. Growing Old Disgracefully explains why The Pretty Things were a hugely underrated and confirms their rightful place in rock's history. Fully illustrated and heavily researched, this is the first biography of a band that was as notorious as the Stones in the development of British rock music. .</td>

 Gee, the Internet charges fifty bucks and this other company charges thirty bucks. For anybody that's really serious about having a network connection, paying something like fifty dollars a year to have a domain name is, like, not really a problem. You're really only talking about the really top-level names, which are presumably the things that get these to big companies or universities or big organizations where they would spend more money thinking about it to write the check than actually writing the check would cost. There's some big business now involved with it that wasn't there before. There really isn't very much argument that charging for domain names to at least recover the cost of doing the job is a problem.</td>
