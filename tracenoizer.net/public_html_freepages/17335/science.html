 I also every once in a while try to swim, so I am also interested in Hydrodanymics and other ways to scientifically improve my swimming. . I am part of the Graphics Group which is part of MIT's Laboratory for Computer Science. I am working under the direction of Assistant Professor Leonard McMillan. Research Interests I am interested in video encoding for the internet (under error-prone conditions), operating systems, and networks.</td>
