 After class, complete phrases and sentences as much as possible. For every significant bit of information, write a cue in the left margin. To review, cover your notes with a card, leaving the cues exposed. Say the cue out loud, then say as much as you can of the material underneath the card. When you have said as much as you can, move the card and see if what you said matches what is written.</td>

 In the case of the Economist, there are no articles saying anything resembling the things that Chomsky suggests. On the contrary, the authority and prestige of the Economist opposes Chomsky's claims. In the case of the Far Eastern Economic review the review did indeed publish an article that said almost, but not quite, what Chomsky represents it has saying. There are however some rather important differences between Chomsky's representation of the article, and the actual article. Chomsky leads the reader to believe that these respectable sources contain evidence rebutting the accusations made against the Khmer Rouge.</td>
