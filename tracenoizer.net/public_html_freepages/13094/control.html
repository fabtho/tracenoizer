 Installation and web browser instructions are included. . Missile Technology Control Regime The Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) is an informal political arrangement formed in 1987 to control the proliferation of rocket and unmanned air vehicle systems capable of delivering weapons of mass destruction and their associated equipment and technology. The MTCR Annex covers a very broad range of items, while the MTCR Annex Handbook (below) emphasizes technologies most critical to missile design and production.

Join FAS Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) Provisions The MTCR restricts the export of delivery systems and related technology for those systems capable of carrying a 500 kilogram payload at least 300 kilometers, as well as systems intended for the delivery of weapons of mass destruction (WMD -- nuclear, chemical, and biological). Unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) include cruise missiles, drones, UAVs, and remotely piloted vehicles (RPVs). Status The MTCR is a voluntary arrangement among 27 countries consisting of common export policies applied to a common list of controlled items.</td>
