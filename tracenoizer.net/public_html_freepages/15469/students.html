 .AR11 COURSEWORK 2 These are the marks for the second coursework. Single honours students (Computing, Computer Science, Informations Systems and Cognitive Science) will find a print-out of their marked work in the filing cabinets on the Long Room (level 9). Other students may come and collect their work from me in my office (9. Please check your marks BEFORE the end of term, and tell me immediately if you spot any problems.</td>

 . PREVIOUS ENTRY Sweet Success SCIENCE ACTIVITY BOOKS NEXT ENTRY Thrill Ride. Targeting Students' Science Misconceptions, a teacher's guide containing directions for approximately 100 activities, is designed to help students identify and change their common, naive preconceptions and misconceptions about science topics. In doing these activities, students first state their ideas about a wide range of physical science concepts, and then they rethink or reconsider them after experimentation in the classroom. They try out the various options and come up with an answer based on their observations.</td>

 Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 27(10), 1033-1052. . Using Technology to Measure Change in Students' Science Learning Using Technology to Measure Change in Students' Science Learning Carl Berger and Charles Dershimer, University of Michigan Presented at the National Association for Research in Science Teaching Atlanta Georgia April 1993 Abstract The purpose of this study was to find if students became more consistant and purposeful as they became more familiar and successful with a microcomputer supported chemistry instructional program. A multimedia interactive software package was used as the learning environment. Students could navigate by clicking on icons that initiated the next event or state of learning.</td>
