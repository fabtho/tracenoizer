 . PREVIOUS ENTRY Sweet Success SCIENCE ACTIVITY BOOKS NEXT ENTRY Thrill Ride. Targeting Students' Science Misconceptions, a teacher's guide containing directions for approximately 100 activities, is designed to help students identify and change their common, naive preconceptions and misconceptions about science topics. In doing these activities, students first state their ideas about a wide range of physical science concepts, and then they rethink or reconsider them after experimentation in the classroom. They try out the various options and come up with an answer based on their observations.</td>

 htmlFrom Connecticut College, a list (with limited biographical information) about women in chemistry, with a link to a site at Princeton that lists (with detailed biographical information), significant African American men and women in many fields of science and engineering. htmlPublished by the American Chemical Society, Chemmatters is a quarterly magazine designed for teachers to use as a supplement to their first year high school chemistry course. A teacher's guide provides additional information on articles, follow-up hands-on activities, classroom demonstrations, and additional resources. htmlAlso provided by the ACS, VC2 provides interesting activities for chemistry students. A section on Science Fairs discusses the choice of projects and how to create the project, report, and display for the science fair.</td>
