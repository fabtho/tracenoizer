 Chester Gillan, Chair of the Council of Ministers of Education, Canada (CMEC). The Pan-Canadian Science Project, involving all provinces and territories except Quebec, is developing a common framework of science outcomes at the K-12 level. The project is expected to define more clearly what students are expected to know and be able to do at regular stages in their school experience. Ministers stated that they will continue sharing information on best practices in science education. The science assessment was part of a national assessment program being carried out by CMEC in three key subject areas using Canadian-developed instruments and criteria.</td>

 We are located on the south campus of the University of Georgia, and are a part of the College of Family and Consumer Sciences. Our faculty is rated highly for its teaching, research, and field experiences. The goal of the Department of Child and Family Development is to provide an educational experience that promotes the integration of knowledge and professional practice from the fields of child development and family studies. Our objectives are to prepare researchers and scholars to generate knowledge about individual and family development and behavior over the life span, as well as educate professionals who will provide educational, counseling, and advocacy services needed for children and families to function more effectively. These objectives are consistent with the goals of The University of Georgia, particularly with regard to its land grant mission of fostering research and its application to enhance the quality of life for all Americans.</td>
