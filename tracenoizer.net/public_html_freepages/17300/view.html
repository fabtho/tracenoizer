 To the extent traditional banks and other regulated financial institutions are playing the key roles in the issuance of electronic money, existing supervisory and regulatory approaches are being adapted as appropriate. In order to accommodate non-traditional issuers, some countries are considering a more specialised supervisory framework specifically for electronic money issuers. Some view the market as providing strong incentives for electronic money issuers to protect themselves against operational and financial risks. Market incentives are seen as being useful in encouraging providers to address consumer protection and law enforcement issues as well. The formulation of these considerations is meant to highlight potentially important aspects without implying any particular policy approach.</td>
