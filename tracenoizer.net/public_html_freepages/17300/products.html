 . Tactical ProjectsStrategic projects are of long-term value to the company, helping to move the company to significant growth and profits. The resultant products tend to be platform products with large growth potential. Tactical projects are in response to current needs; relatively minor product variations or improvements to a product that is already in the marketplace (line maintenance) and or process and cost reduction projects. These projects usually are fairly small in scope and growth potential.</td>

 At their meeting in July 1996 the G-10 Governors discussed the various reports that had been commissioned and agreed on the publication of the present report on Security of Electronic Money. The report is not necessarily intended to represent the official views of the Governors. The Task Force on Security of Electronic Money met regularly between January and March 1996 and during that period also organised meetings with potential suppliers of various types of electronic money products. The intention was neither to cover the entire spectrum of products nor to assess individual systems, but to understand and evaluate the relevant security aspects relating to electronic money. This report highlights the main design features and functional aspects of electronic money products and analyses the technical risks specific to these products.</td>
