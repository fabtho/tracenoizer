 Back to Top Peak Heat Loads (MW)JanFeb MarAprMayJunJulAugSep OctNovDecWeekdays2. 53 Back to Top Developing profile shapes to take into account seasons, plant size and accommodation use. Back to Top Degree Days Analysis A quite common technique in apportioning energy use is to relate it to the degree days of the environment.
