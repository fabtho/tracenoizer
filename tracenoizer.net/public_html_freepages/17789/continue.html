 My husband and I were delighted to receive a letter from Bryan Anderson who resides in the same place as Justin. He has enjoyed 'Freedom Within' and this is a blessing to us as this is the intent of Justin's newsletter - to reach out to others in the hope and prayer that they too may come to saving faith in our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. We would ask our readers that you would continue in prayer for the financial support of Justin and 'Freedom Within' and we know all too well that God hears "the prayers of the righteous" and so will provide accordingly in His time and not ours. "I will extol thee, my God, O King and bless thy name for ever and ever. I humbly accept this challenge and pray that the Lord may use it for His glory and that I wrote according to His will.</td>

 Burst fire, defined as a shot composed of multiple projectiles where the trigger must be pulled for each burst, is also not penalized. Full auto weapons for game purposes will fire 3 projectiles per Melee Phase that they are operating. A character may continue full auto fire even in Melee Phases where he has no actions. Having multiple actions in a Melee Phase does not increase the rate of fire of a weapon. Full auto fire will take precedence over all further actions a character has, with the exception of simple actions like talking or walking, until he ceases fire after which time other actions may occur.</td>

 Dry Suit Underwater exposure suit that is waterproof and filled with air. Dry clothes are worn under a dry suit for extra insulation. Dual Regulator Systems Dual regulator systems use two regulators on a single air supply to allow a diver access to continue to access his air supply in the event of a malfunction in the main regulator. Equalization Equalization is the act of forcing air into an open space to offset increasing hydrostatic pressure. Exposure Protection Garments worn to prevent decreases in core body temperature and abrasion by the elements.</td>
