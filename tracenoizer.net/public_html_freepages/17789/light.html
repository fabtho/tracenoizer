<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" When you stop a movie projector you get a single still picture, but a frame of video is composed of two images captured a moment apart. If there is significant motion during that moment, you'll see a flickering effect caused by the two alternating fields. The balls of light on the original video show no such flickering when the tape is paused, despite their apparent hundred-mile-per-hour speed. If they were captured with a normal video camera, the lights should move between each of the fields, but they don't. However, computer animation systems CAN produce exactly that result.">
