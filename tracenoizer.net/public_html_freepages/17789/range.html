 The standard spear is single notch with a fixed barb, double notch spears ship with double rubber guns. Fixed barb spears suit the nature of the Railgun and offer a faster and more accurate piece of equipment. The standard lengths of spears range from 1,1 metres to 2 metres and one has a choice of 6,5 or 7mm diameters for more greater penetration power. ..</td>

 We all know she hasn't posed nude yet, although I don't know how long that statement will be true considering she's half naked all the time anyhow. But here your fantasies can finally be realized, as you will now find hundreds of fake nudes of Britney Spears, the largest collection you will find anywhere in one place, that have been created by digital artists out of pure fantasy. These wonderfully imaginative fake nudes of Britney Spears range from being quite creative and realistic to downright unrealistic, but I post them all for you to decide for yourself what looks real and what does not. You will also find here all the videos of her circulating around the net as real, but aren't. These pics are in no way intended to be a true representation of the activities she engages in.</td>
