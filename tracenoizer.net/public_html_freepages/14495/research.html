 Ben Shneiderman's Fall 2001 CMSC838s, a seminar on understandng the Human-Computer Interaction of mobile devices. . Individuals that are computer knowledgeable, and possess a genuine interest, have the ability to perform research in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). The goal is to assist the user in selecting the most appropriate method for a researcher's specific interest. This website organizes the methods into the following categories.</td>

 . Our activities include an annual training institute, where leading scholars will teach advanced qualitative methods to about twenty-five graduate students and junior faculty. Our officers are prominent scholars drawn from leading research universities across the country. Our concern is that very few leading research universities offer graduate-level qualitative methods courses and even fewer require them. As a consequence, the social sciences are failing to take advantage of recent advances in qualitative methods, and in the long run risk losing an important component of their methodological heterogeneity.</td>
