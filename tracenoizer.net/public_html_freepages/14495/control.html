 This paper studies the relationship between generation level schedule, energy delivery schedule and physical ramp-rate of a generating unit. It is shown that although ramp-rate constraints are satisfied in traditional unit commitment problems, taking a generation level schedule as an energy delivery schedule may not be realizable. The admissible region of energy delivery is established in this paper as a set of recursive equations by using the Maximum Principle in optimal control theory. This set of equations provides a sufficient and necessary condition to check whether an energy delivery schedule is realizable.

 We use sensitive tools that allow us to measure neuronal function in the intact tissue. Two-photon laser scanning microscopy allows us to keep track of neuronal excitability at the level of single synapses by measuring intracellular calcium levels. Optical uncaging of neurotransmitters allows us to excite subcellular structures with great spatial and temporal control. Intracellular electrical recordings using sharp and whole-cell electrodes allow us to monitor the electrical potential of neurons. Imaging of intrinsic signals allows us to characterize large-scale dynamics of the brain.</td>
