 Proceedings of the Thirty-second Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences Copyright (c) 1998 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc. . Failing to fulfill energy delivery obligation may result in penalty to energy suppliers. This paper studies the relationship between generation level schedule, energy delivery schedule and physical ramp-rate of a generating unit. It is shown that although ramp-rate constraints are satisfied in traditional unit commitment problems, taking a generation level schedule as an energy delivery schedule may not be realizable.</td>

 Implementation of RTD activities is through calls for proposals launched according to a well-established time schedule. . While objectives relating to energy, environment and sustainable development are reflected in criteria for selection throughout the Framework Programme, the Specific Programme on Energy, Environment and Sustainable Development (EESD) focuses directly on a number of pressing environmental and energy concerns. Making use of the knowledge and technologies developed by this programme will make it possible to meet a wide range of social and economic needs so reconciling economic development with environmental sustainability. The results will support policies formulated at Community level or deriving from international commitments.</td>
