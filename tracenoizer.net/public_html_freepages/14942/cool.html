 The guy even fixed up his web pages so any browser can access them, when I tipped him to what he was mising, so go visit this site and see this band. Go see them Danny Godinez BandThis band was described to me as similar to Jeff Beck, Gerry Garcia and Dave Matthews, but they are a local band that has shared the stage with acts like Jim Page and Source of Labor. They have a nice web site, with Mp3 files, a calendar and links to cool stuff like the Indy Media Center. So I would suggest give them a listen and judge for yourself Selah 7 ClockwiseClockwise seems like a eclectic psycadelic jam band, they have a pretty web page with lot's of art and a couple of mp3 and real audio samples Chris Spencer Chris Spencer is a local Jazz musician and instructor, this is a nice site with a performance calendar and plenty of audio files Shamans in the Age of Intelligent Machines Video of Terence McKenna in Seattle Grand Rapids minimalist emocore.
