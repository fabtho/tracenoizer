 At a time when young people are force-fed so much pap-pop, Michelle's music is a deep breath of fresh honesty. Check out these artists who are coming to Toronto this week. The Barenaked Ladies kicked off their North American tour with a stop in their hometown of Toronto. Their set offered a great mix of tunes from their latest effort, Maroon, back to the classics, which included the always-popular If I Had a Million Dollars. Tune in to hear up-to-the-minute audio news three times daily on CORE.</td>
