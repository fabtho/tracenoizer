 Questions provide an ability for students to ask questions of project participants via email. . The goal is to encourage students' interest in science and technology careers by portraying the NASA experts as friendly people through biographies and field journals of day-to-day activities. While the project was active (Fall 1996), students were encouraged to interact with these enthusiastic folks as a way to further engage them in the process of cutting-edge research. Journal reports from Mir personnel describe their day-to-day activities and their particular role in the project.</td>
