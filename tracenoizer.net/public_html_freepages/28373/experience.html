Auchincloss and Arie Bodek The Physics and Astronomy Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Program is funded by the National Science Foundation to support ten to twelve highly-qualified students to undertake supervised research projects in the Department of Physics and Astronomy, for a period of 10 weeks each summer. Much of the research performed by past undergraduate research assistants has been published in scientific journals. Many students have also presented their work at National Conferences and undergraduate research symposia at the University of Rochester.</td>
