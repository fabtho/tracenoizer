 Deadlines forced an early exit, before headliner Diffie performed, but Ketchum thankfully slipped in under the wire. Ketchum's music has only improved over the years, adding depth of feeling and a wider musical palette. His music is now more Americana than mainstream country, but with songs such as "I Miss My Mary" he still manages to keep old fans happy while courting a new crowd with promising new material such as "The Millionaire's Wife. " Clay Davidson, however, courts a really old crowd -- namely anyone who considers Southern rock a peak moment in music history. Davidson's music is built from the same blueprint that Lynyrd Skynyrd used, and he paid tribute to his primary inspiration with a cover of "What's My Name" that easily captured the original's whiskey abandon.</td>

 Michael McDonald was on the guest list, but he had to cancel at the last minute. So Tammy used that opportunity to ask if it was okay if my wife and I went out, and Scott said sure. At the party there were all these artists -- Keith Urban, Kim Richey, Jude Cole, and others -- sitting around and taking turns playing songs on acoustic guitar. Towards the end of the night I got up and did two or three songs. After that, Scott said he was getting ready to open up the Virgin Nashville label and that I was more than welcome to come by and see him.</td>
