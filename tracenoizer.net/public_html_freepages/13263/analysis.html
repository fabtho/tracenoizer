 You can use the links at left to navigate around the site. TO TAKE A WEB-BASED PERSONALITY TEST or to participate in an online PSYCHOLOGY EXPERIMENT, select your study from the online testing page. The job analysis pages contain documents, data, and software dealing with the job analysis (JA) and classification research we've done at Virginia Tech. After you've looked around, you can use the sign-in form to give me feedback , if you wish. .</td>

 . Assess the adequacy and accuracy of the Marini and Murray model for SLR at the 1 mm level, for all elevations above 15 degrees and all wavelengths from 355 nm to 1570 nm and perhaps beyond. Prepare a formal recommendation to the ILRS, including a standard algorithm and set of recommended practices, for adoption by the stations and analysis centres. If this report indicates that revision is necessary, present a formal recommendation to ILRS at the ILRS Governing Board meeting subsequent to the Matera meeting. It might be desirable to extend the region of applicability to elevations lower than 15 degrees.</td>

 It is engaged in research and graduate instruction in the techniques of satellite oceanography and their application to problems in physical, biological and chemical oceanography. There is a strong link to the Atmospheric and Ocean Optics Group in the Physics Department. Current efforts range from analysis of satellite observations to theoretical radiative transfer modeling of the earth-atmosphere system. There are over a dozen additional projects outside these programs. TOGA efforts focus on development of improved tropical SST fields based on satellite infrared observations.</td>
