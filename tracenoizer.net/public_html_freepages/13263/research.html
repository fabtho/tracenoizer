 Our focus includes designing and developing algorithms and techniques to solve both contemporary and practical problems in computer vision, image processing and AI. njoy your visit, and feel free to send e-mail to any of us if you have specific questions or comments. You can also read more about research at USF through the Office of Institutional Research and Planning. ..</td>

 The group also designs proprietary, Windows-based software to enable end-users to access and manipulate ISI publication and citation data with maximum power and flexibility. . The data provided by the Research Services Group is based on the bibliographic and citation information that ISI collects from its multidisciplinary database of thousands of influential, peer-reviewed journals. The Research Services Group maintains a file of publication and citation data spanning 1981 to 1999 that is specially structured in a relational database format for bibliometric analysis. It is multidisciplinary in scope and exhaustive in coverage of bibliographic information and citation counts (essential measures of research influence and impact).</td>
