 Johnson This is one of those utilities that I've been meaning to write for a while. Actually, this isn't that hard to do, although the code is too long to show in a 10-minute solution (see the download for the complete code). The code is a slight modification of the code I wrote to create NT services using either the Microsoft unsupported OCX or pure VB code. As part of the article, I included code to create your own Service Control Manager (SCM). The included code is a simplified version of that SCM, which allows you to select any NT computer on your domain and look for a single service installed on that computer.</td>
