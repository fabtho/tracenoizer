 . As I was looking around the web for information, I didn't come across any really good information in English on this amazing Chilean folk singer, and so I thought I would try and share the amazing songs and beautiful life of Victor Jara with even the non-spanish speaking. If you have any questions or notice any problems, please e-mail me and let me know. Thanks for coming to this page, and I really hope you learn something about Victor Jara. Due to my lack of spanish skills, I'm not going to try to transcribe any songs into English and ruin them, unless there is an already published version I can steal.</td>
