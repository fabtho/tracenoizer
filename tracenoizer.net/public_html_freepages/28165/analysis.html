 Can you outline what these perspectives are, and what can you do to address these differences through practical services. . Further, a shared understanding of entrepreneurship emerged from this analysis given the differences and similarities across participant sites in terms of (1) approach to business incubation, (2) education and training opportunities to foster entrepreneurship in business incubation or through college coursework, and (3) opportunities and limitations affecting entrepreneurial development. According to the cross-analysis design, only the involvement of community colleges and postsecondary technical-education institutions will be discussed here. The analysis on the elements of entrepreneurship and opportunities for participation in community economic development is left open for the users.</td>
