 Can you outline what these perspectives are, and what can you do to address these differences through practical services. . Further, a shared understanding of entrepreneurship emerged from this analysis given the differences and similarities across participant sites in terms of (1) approach to business incubation, (2) education and training opportunities to foster entrepreneurship in business incubation or through college coursework, and (3) opportunities and limitations affecting entrepreneurial development. According to the cross-analysis design, only the involvement of community colleges and postsecondary technical-education institutions will be discussed here. The analysis on the elements of entrepreneurship and opportunities for participation in community economic development is left open for the users.</td>

 Selection of Case Study Sites Since the purpose of the case study design was to develop an understanding of a "bounded" system and features common across the system (see Stake, 1994), we selected nine sites representing various contexts and levels of two-year college involvement. The selection process included the review and screening of 25 incubators with primary sponsorship from community colleges and 20 community colleges which offer a coherent series of courses on entrepreneurship identified through a review of related literature or nominations by experts in the field (e. , NBIA executive staff and state directors of postsecondary technical education). Site selection criteria included the presence of a comprehensive approach to education and training on entrepreneurship to foster economic development in the community through business incubation, courses on entrepreneurship, or a combination of both. Selected sites included seven two-year technical colleges representing various levels of involvement in economic development efforts in the community through either support of business incubation or entrepreneurship courses offered to the general public.</td>
