Abstract This document explains some common mistakes in user agents due to incorrect or incomplete implementation of specifications, and suggests remedies. It also suggests some "good behavior" where specifications themselves do not specify any particular behavior (e. This document is not a complete set of guidelines for good user agent behavior.</td>

 Many such calculations take a significant time to set up and can run for minutes, hours or even days on the most powerful computers. Various versions of REDUCE have been in use for over twenty years. There has been a steady stream of improvements and refinements since then, with the source being subject to wide review by the user community. REDUCE has thus evolved into a powerful system whose critical components are highly reliable, stable and efficient. A particular algebra system is often chosen for a given calculation because of its widespread use in a particular application area, with existing packages and templates being used to speed up problem solving.</td>
