Increasing your Core Voltage or IO Voltage This fix is more tailored towards those who have some knowledge about their computer and how to change information in the bios or on the motherboard. If you have a Thunderbird AMD chip, which is of 1ghz or higher, it is sometimes important that you have a core voltage of at least 1. Sometimes this is stated as being the voltage within the Motherboard bios, and monitoring software, however some motherboards supply incorrect information about what voltage your system is using, thus it is important to manually increase your core voltage to 1.</td>

 Consider placing your own banner ad on VoyForums -- to find out more, visit our advertising page. I see a lot of confusing options on the advanced configuration page. Once I made my forum, how do I go change things or delete messages. My images aren't showing (background, header, post, etc. I have a question that is probably frequently asked, but I don't see it here.</td>
