 The status of India with regard to education and employment opportunities are also contributory factors for the rapid turnover. Moreover, it is not as if there is no turnover of sales force in other industries. People, including the writer, must realise the inherent problems in this industry.

 At the Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School, we have spent much of the past two decades pioneering contemporary negotiation theory and practice. Drawing on 15 years of work with thousands of people in hundreds of organizations, and in contexts ranging from executive workshops to labor-management contract talks to the world's most intractable conflicts, we have developed an innovative, pragmatic and effective framework for making difficult conversations less stressful and more productive. By putting into practice mutual gains negotiation strategies and an innovative new method for analyzing and managing interpersonal interactions, you will learn how to deal creatively with tough problems while treating people with decency and integrity. Led by Bruce Patton, co-author of Getting To Yes and deputy director of the Harvard Negotiation Project, and HNP colleagues Sheila Heen and Douglas Stone, the program is designed to help you deal successfully with your most difficult communications and transform your most difficult relationship problems. You will learn, as the faculty have over time, what works and why, and the principles that can be applied by any executive in any situation.</td>

 Therefore we will only include the official explanation of the problem from VIA. Information has been provided to all motherboard manufacturers on how to correctly resolve both the data corruption error and the Sound Blaster Live conflict. We provided this patch to make sure as many people got a fix to their Sound Blaster Live problems as soon as possible. Most motherboard manufacturers have now corrected their bios and the patch is not necessarily needed although it will not harm any VIA based system if installed. If you are interested in any other theories by others it is suggested that you look on the VIAHARDWARE FORUM where continued threads are created around the issue, and many others.</td>
