 Notice that the above modules simply describe the action to be taken by the controller, but they need not specify how, or even if it is possible to take such action. . The control action module representing can be viewed as a sequential list of instructions to follow whenever the appropriate proposition has signaled true. So, these modules will include a start_control transition which is triggered by the true transition of . In addition, the module may contain an Alarm transition, which is triggered by true whenever it occurs before the controller completes the control action behavior described in .</td>

 Terminating a Process When you use the Process Control action to terminate a process, enter the name of the process you wish to terminate, exactly as it appears in the Process List in the Task Manager. . For example, if you have a mission critical program, you can create a Process Monitor that watches to make sure the program is running, and link it to a Process Control action to automatically restart the program if it terminates. The Process Control action can also be used as a generic way to extend the functionality of Appmon, since it can be used to execute any arbitrary command line. You can specify a limit to restrict the number of times Appmon will attempt to start or stop the process in a given time period.</td>
