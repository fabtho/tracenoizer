 . The names of the controls appear in the Controls field as they are carried out. Later, when the Save Exercise command is issued, these recorded control actions will generate Control items in the lesson that are built from the patterned exercise specification. This command is not enabled until a configuration has been selected. If a new presentation order is selected during a Controls specification, the Controls field is erased and the data about the control manipulations is lost.</td>

 Notice that the above modules simply describe the action to be taken by the controller, but they need not specify how, or even if it is possible to take such action. . The control action module representing can be viewed as a sequential list of instructions to follow whenever the appropriate proposition has signaled true. So, these modules will include a start_control transition which is triggered by the true transition of . In addition, the module may contain an Alarm transition, which is triggered by true whenever it occurs before the controller completes the control action behavior described in .</td>
