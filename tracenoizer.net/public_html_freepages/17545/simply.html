 As population increases, there is no way the status quo can be maintained. As technology expands, the support for that technology also expands, placing upon the society pressures that have to be adjusted. While men can live as natives did when there are millions of square miles of vacant land, as the population increases there is simply not room for everyone to live in that way. Can you imagine how it would be for five billion people all needing a hundred square miles for hunting or fishing. While it is romantic to consider the free and unfettered lifestyle of the Native American, it is impossible for that lifestyle to continue with so many humans sharing the same space.</td>
