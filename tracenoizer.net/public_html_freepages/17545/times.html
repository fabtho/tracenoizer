 For example, if you have a mission critical program, you can create a Process Monitor that watches to make sure the program is running, and link it to a Process Control action to automatically restart the program if it terminates. The Process Control action can also be used as a generic way to extend the functionality of Appmon, since it can be used to execute any arbitrary command line. You can specify a limit to restrict the number of times Appmon will attempt to start or stop the process in a given time period. It is generally a good idea to set such a limit to prevent Appmon from getting locked into an endless loop with a process that fails every time Appmon starts it. You may also specify responses, which are additional actions Appmon should execute after it starts or stops the program.</td>

 Up until a couple months ago, I have had to pay out-of-pocket for everything. I've learned that if it is something you have to have, it will cost you. I can tell you that there have been a few times that, even though I needed pouches or wafers, I would have to wait a few days and make do by "patching" with paste. My pharmacist is a great guy and allows me to charge whatever I might need, but I hate to have to ask him to do that. Like I said, I am someone who is fortunate enough to live pretty comfortably, so I can't imagine what some people have to do.</td>

 It is what helps you bridge the gulf of real differences in what people believe or feel. It is what helps you stand up to adversity, maintain leadership, and remain in control. At times, every executive is faced with the prospect of conversations that make them feel uncomfortable and awkward, particularly when the stakes are important and the outcome is uncertain, when people feel deeply about what is being discussed or about the people discussing it or when self esteem is on the line. A difficult conversation is anything you find hard to talk about. Whatever the context, when we get into trouble, we all share the same fears and fall into the same common traps.</td>
