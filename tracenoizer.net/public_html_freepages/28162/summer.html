 Since our moon is not the unique moon in our universe. There are uncountable moons surrounding their planets (perhaps some of them are other earths that hold different life forms and even advanced civilizations). Last summer (June, 2000) I migrated to Canada and decided to lead a new life in the new hometown, thus I have made an English name for myself - Hudon, which is the major body of my Chinese name without tails in each character (Hui to Hu and dong to don). This is a bit creative work to try to have a real English name for others to easily access meanwhile keep the trace of my source - China and an memory of my native land. Lee is another memorial to the original root of my ancestors - Korea as people there use Lee in English spelling for the family name I hold while Chinese use Li instead .</td>

 Her interest in performing took her to also study voice, ballet and flamenco dance. From 1988-90 she attended the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA) in London England and returned to Canada to embark on a professional career as an actor. Over the past 9 years, Anita has worked in most areas of acting ranging from film and television to regional summer festivals, Alternative Toronto Theatre, work-shopping of new plays and to producing her own projects. In 1990, she became a founding member of a women's Collective called the Toronto Women's Auxiliary (TWA). This was a group of young women performers who came together to explore the role of women in theatre in Canada.</td>
