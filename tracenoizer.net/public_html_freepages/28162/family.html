 Last summer (June, 2000) I migrated to Canada and decided to lead a new life in the new hometown, thus I have made an English name for myself - Hudon, which is the major body of my Chinese name without tails in each character (Hui to Hu and dong to don). This is a bit creative work to try to have a real English name for others to easily access meanwhile keep the trace of my source - China and an memory of my native land. Lee is another memorial to the original root of my ancestors - Korea as people there use Lee in English spelling for the family name I hold while Chinese use Li instead . Therefore, at last, my new English name turned to be Hudon Lee. .</td>
