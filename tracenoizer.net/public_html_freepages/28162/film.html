 It's directed by Wong Jing, who's known for making hits. It's got flying people, kung fu, first grade humor. Nonetheless, it was such a flop that even though the film ends midway through its story, the planned sequel never happened. The reason for this failure is probably that the film is just bad, but in a very campy and amusing way. First of all, the plot is the most ridiculously convoluted thing ever made.</td>
