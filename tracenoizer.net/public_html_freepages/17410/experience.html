 About 75 librarians participate on this discussion group. One of the chief advantages of this discussion group is the collegiality of the participants. Since they have all gone through a similar experience, questions and comments are freely put forth without fear of blame or reproach. Also, since the questions go to a closed group, a director knows the questions will not be read by his or her staff or supervisor. These reunions have proved a good avenue for participants from different years to meet each other and for mentors to meet other mentors and first-year directors.</td>
