<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" John Holt is an author and expert in the childhood learning process. A weakness of traditional education, he feels, is that children are required to spend years memorizing facts that hold no interest for them. Alternatively, children left to learn through fantasy and play are able to gather information at their own pace and under their own conditions. When left alone, Holt maintains, children are capable of complicated games that would baffle children in a classroom situation. In his article "Messing About in Science," Holt advocates for the allocation of larger blocks of time devoted to free and unguided exploration work.">

's 'The Royle Family', but is infinitely superior to it because it dramatises Sandra's rejection of her family who are caught in a little claustrophobic world of materialism and futile dreams. Over 1400 people attended the play which was a big success, though there were a few hiccups on the final night. The superb set was constructed by TMW and DEC; the stage crew did a fine job, and the play was directed and produced by JSG - his tenth school play in as many years.

 Each year, the Unit handles more than 2,500 cases involving video evidence, and helps to secure the identity of more than 50 per cent of offenders. That may sound a high success rate, but in real terms for every criminal traced with video evidence, one gets away. DO Make sure your cameras are positioned correctly and in focus Clean your lens and camera Clean the heads in your video Change and rotate your tapes Store your tapes in an upright position, away from heat and humidity Keep all tapes in a clean secure area Have your equipment serviced regularly Label all tapes Have only the relevant information on the screen Use a quality videocassette Only buy from reputable suppliers Use sequential switching, if your system has it DON'T Continually reuse the same tapes Let the tapes get dusty or dirty Place the tapes near a magnetic field Leave the tape in the machine Touch the tape Buy cheap, inferior tapes Use 240-minute tapes Record in long play (LP) Use random switching Record in "quad" format Have a viewing angle that's too wide Any retail outlet or office wanting to receive an "Infocus" pack can contact 01772-618622 and quote "Infocus". ..</td>
