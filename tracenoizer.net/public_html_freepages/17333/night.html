 An escort should check the immediate area for potential risks and always walk a few metres behind the cash carrier. Divide the risk - use two or more people to carry the cash or bank smaller sums more frequently. Take care when using a night safe - money should never be exposed to view until the night safe is open. Escorts should stand with their backs to the safe, looking for potential risks. In a vehicle Where practical, a closed vehicle should be used for moving moderate to large sums of money.</td>

 The above mural was respectfully submitted to WJ as a class gift and hangs prominently in a hallway of Walter Johnson. I took this photo of the mural on a tour of the school. The reunion started off Friday night at the Kenwood Country Club with a dinner and DJ. Most felt too old or tired to dance, but we could still recall enough of the old days to laugh at ourselves and carry on lively conversations. Saturday, we got up early for a tour of the old high school with the Vice Principal.</td>

 When is a good time to deliver the items and to whom specifically. Also, please be sure they don't have a thrift shop where they might sell the items you make. Pick a night that is good for all family members and sit down together to discuss your plan of action. Will you be teaching the kids to sew together yarn squares, will you be tying a quilt. Now-- the most important part, gather your family together and either stitch together the crocheted or knit squares, or tie the quilts you have pieced together.</td>
