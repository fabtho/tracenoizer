 An escort should check the immediate area for potential risks and always walk a few metres behind the cash carrier. Divide the risk - use two or more people to carry the cash or bank smaller sums more frequently. Take care when using a night safe - money should never be exposed to view until the night safe is open. Escorts should stand with their backs to the safe, looking for potential risks. In a vehicle Where practical, a closed vehicle should be used for moving moderate to large sums of money.</td>

The kind of help you should offer is caring advice, not money. You are likely to attract the wrong kind of attention when making choices today. Your ability to put a deal together will surprise others.</td>
