 As a result, scholars have recently begun to focus on the examination of regions. All regions need to be understood on their own terms, not just in relation to the Euro-American world. Thus understanding must come from the use of the theoretical tools of political economy, and also from a deep cultural and linguistic knowledge of the region. It is in this light that this programme will focus upon the major aspects of interaction at a number of levels within the East Asian Political Economy. This taught in-house Masters degree programme lasts for one year.</td>
