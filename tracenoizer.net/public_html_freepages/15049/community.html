 OSU Home Page OSU Mission View OSU Disclaimer Comments and Suggestions . . For this reason that phrase is an appropriate way of expressing how I have felt as I have observed and participated in recent campus and community conversations. The conversations took place as a result of observations by some that we have had an increase in incidents of hate on campus and in the city of Corvallis. However, I have this nagging feeling that by focusing our energy on eliminating those negative elements we are setting our standards too low.</td>

 The Forum also offers the speakers a chance to experience the vibrancy of life on this campus. Speakers routinely express their gratitude for the opportunity to have discussions with students and faculty members about the work that they do and their perceptions of the fields of interests of the guests. Since many Forum speakers are national and international policy makers, gathering thoughts and suggestions from the Colleges community aids in their future work. The President's Forum Series will continue to bring important politicians, intellectuals, and social activists to campus - allowing the community the continual flow and exchange of ideas. .</td>
