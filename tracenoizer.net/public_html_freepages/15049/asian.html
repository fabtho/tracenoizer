 In our very first semester, APA undertook many exciting endeavors. -- Working with the UC Berkeley Career Center on presenting a very successful Law School Fair. -- Putting on the "Sex, Power, and Politics" Forum with many Asian American political notables, like Assemblywoman Wilma Chan. It was an amazing and encouraging sight to see a packed Lecture Hall of students interested in API politics. -- Campaigning in the Davis area for potentially the first elected Pilipino-American Assemblyman, Chris Cabaldon.</td>
