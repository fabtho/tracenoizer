 In the meantime, I found more and more people who love his music and who searched for means to promote it. In Germany, artists started the Avet Terterial Foundation in cooperation with Irina Tigranova-Terterian, his widow. Alexander Alexandroff in Munich, composer and bassoon-player, works on a film with music by Terterian. With these pages, I want to promote Avet Terterian and I offer space to publish here. In the meantime, I met Kai Grehn, a german director and founding member of the foundation, and we discussed what to do.</td>

 (3) By the end of the nineteenth century, then, mathematicians had established a general understanding of what topology was. For instance, a clay flower pot and a doughnut are topologically equivalent. Topology has been used in coloring maps, distinguishing knots (such as DNA), and classifying surfaces (even by architects, including the designer of the Olympic buildings in Munich). (4) Mathematicians today think of topology as the study of spaces and of continuity. Under the requirements of topology, every point in the original object must find a place in the new one, and the mathematician concentrates on the changes in the form of the object.</td>
