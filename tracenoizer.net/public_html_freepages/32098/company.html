 Avet Terterian (1929 - 1994) and his music is not very known in the western music world. His music was not played so often, fame came too late, in his case. The first CD with his 3rd and 4th Symphony was released in 1997 by a british company, some records of his concerts are hard to find in Russia, although Melodya published some of his work. I heard his music first in Ekaterinburg, february 1992. From this time, I tried to listen to music, to find records.</td>

 Alexander Alexandroff in Munich, composer and bassoon-player, works on a film with music by Terterian. His music was not played so often, fame came too late, in his case. The first CD with his 3rd and 4th Symphony was released in 1997 by a british company, some records of his concerts are hard to find in Russia, although Melodya published some of his work. She was sixth at regionals on the beam in 1996 and competes for Alexander Alexandroff and Jackie McCarter with Brown's in Houston. The National Letter-of-Intent early signing period ends today.</td>
