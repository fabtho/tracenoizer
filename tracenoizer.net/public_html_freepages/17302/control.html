 No endorsement of products mentioned is intended nor is criticism implied of products not mentioned. . Soaps can be used to control a wide range of plant pests. Small, soft-bodied arthropods such as aphids, mealybugs, psyllids and spider mites are most susceptible to soaps. The ease of use, safety and selective action of soaps appeal to many people.</td>

 Growth factor signal transduction in endothelial cells appears to be critical in these processes. We have isolated and characterized several novel growth factors and receptors of endothelial and hematopoietic cells and aim to inhibit or stimulate angiogenesis on basis of their signalling properties. We also explore related aspects of endothelial cell biology, such as the role of apoptosis in angiogenesis and vessel remodelling and endothelial cell-specific gene control elements and gene expression using some of the molecular tools we have generated. Of particular interest are mechanisms of lymphatic vascular growth or lymphanigiogenesis and its involvement in tumor metastasis. Angiogenesis and permeability of blood vessels are regulated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) via its two known receptors VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2.</td>
