The ease of use, safety and selective action of soaps appeal to many people. Limitations of soaps include the need to wet the insect during application, absence of any residual effectiveness, and potential to damage some plants. Soaps or detergents used for control of insects are applied as dilute sprays, mixed with water to produce a concentration of about 2 percent. Soaps have been used to control insects for more than 200 years.">

 Ongoing experiments will address the role of the VEGFR-3 signaling pathway in embryonic and tumor angiogenesis and the mechanisms of lymphatic metastasis. The discovered molecules may allow the regulation of angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis as well as inhibition of tumor metastasis and tissue edema involved in many diseases. To define the functions of the VEGF-B, VEGF-C, VEGF-D growth factors and the VEGFR-3 receptor and their potential uses in diseases. To define the molecular mechanisms of lymphatic metastasis of cancer and possibilities of its inhibition. To elucidate the gene expression profile, and cell biology of the lymphatic vs.</td>

 I spent countless hours on the Net every day, taking on all comers, patiently replying to different variants of the same bad arguments a different way each time, so it might not bore but inform the silent majority that I assumed were following all this. (I still have no idea how many were "tuning in"; although Usenet's Arbitron statistics estimate the total readership of each group, one does not know how many of them -- and who -- are following a particular discussion "thread. html) as well as a potential solution to the problem (Harnad et al. It is unlikely that I would have come up with those ideas otherwise. What's relevant here is that even with that less than optimal demography, the interaction proved to be such a powerful idea-generator for me.</td>
