 Access to the network is via Frame Relay Access Devices (FRADs) which translate the data (eg Ethernet, Token Ring) into frame relay packets. The network sets up a virtual circuit which is a path to the destination. Frame relay is more popular in the US than in Europe, but the main European carriers offer frame relay service. Frame relay can operate at speeds of up to 45 Mbps, since it is a lightweight system without error correction, relying on the integrity of the fibre optic hardware.
