 The rules for determining the cacheability of HTTP responses are defined in section 13. Even if a resource is cacheable, there may be additional constraints on whether a cache can use the cached copy for a particular request. first-hand A response is first-hand if it comes directly and without unnecessary delay from the origin server, perhaps via one or more proxies. A response is also first-hand if its validity has just been checked directly with the origin server. explicit expiration time The time at which the origin server intends that an entity should no longer be returned by a cache without further validation.</td>

 There will actually be two local PCI buses on the card, bridged to the main system bus by a two-bus bridge. If the first run isn't just 25 boards (which is Simtec's minimum viable run) but 250, then it gets cheaper for everyone. Miguel suggested that it would be really cool if the SA-110s could directly talk to other things on the host's PCI bus, and I agreed. '' So it sounds like a pretty incredible piece of hardware. Off-the-shelf free software could make it different from other similar projects that have gone before -- it'll be easy to use (at least for those of us who have done massively parallel processing on Linux before) and won't have a long lag time to develop software for it.</td>
