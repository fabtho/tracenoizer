5 G Refers to wireless telecommunications technology that is more advanced than 2G but does not meet requirements for 3G(g). 3G Third Generation The next generation of Cellular Radio(g) for mobile telephony. Due to come on stream from 20 01 onwards, 3G will be the first cellular radio technology designed from the outset to support wideband data communications just as well as it supports voice communications. It will be the basis for a wireless information society where access to information and information services such as electronic commerce is available anytime, anyplace and anywhere to anybody. Ericsson has an excellent video presentation about third generation wireless on their web site.</td>

 Such questionnaires may be less susceptible to bias. For instance, Witmer and Singer (1998) developed a 32-item Presence Questionnaire (PQ). Data derived from 152 participants, who completed questionnaires after performing one of a range of tasks in a virtual environment, were subjected to a cluster analysis. Slater (1999) takes issue with some of Witmer and Singer's presence questions. He argues that the PQ confounds the objective, physical properties of the technology with subjective, experiential aspects of presence.</td>
