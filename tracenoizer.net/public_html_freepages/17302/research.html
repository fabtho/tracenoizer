Growth factor signal transduction in endothelial cells appears to be critical in these processes. We have isolated and characterized several novel growth factors and receptors of endothelial and hematopoietic cells and aim to inhibit or stimulate angiogenesis on basis of their signalling properties.</td>

 Without conflicts with adults and peers that are managed constructively, healthy cognitive and social development cannot take place. Once learned, conflict skills go with students to every situation and every relationship. A number of recent research studies have found that executives in high-level positions spend much of their time dealing with conflicts. The more skillful they are at doing so, the more successful their careers. The same may be said for quality of marriages, parenting, friendships, and so forth.</td>
