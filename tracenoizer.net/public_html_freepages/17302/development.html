 The limits established by the CCPR reflect levels of residues which are both toxicologically acceptable and achievable in view of current agricultural practice in the countries which use these pesticides. This question, which was also recognized in the Consultation on Risk Management, is under consideration in the CCRVDF and it would be useful to consider it from a similar point of view in other relevant committees. 15) The Committee on Food Hygiene is currently considering the development of principles and guidelines for microbiological risk management, and it has been noted that specific difficulties exist in the area of microbiological contamination due to uncertainty factors in risk assessment. This is also reflected in the fact that few microbiological criteria have been developed in the framework of Codex, as the focus is more on preventive measures throughout the food chain, the development of codes of practice including good manufacturing practice and the application of the HACCP system where appropriate. 16) In relation to uncertainty reference has sometimes been made to the precautionary principle, although there is no internationally accepted definition of this term, which was originally used in relation to the environment, but might be transposed to food safety aspects.</td>

 . Preface (back to Table of Contents) The Mathematics Resource Guide with Core Curriculum is one of four documents recently developed by the New York State Education Department. These documents were designed to provide guidance to districts and schools in New York State for development of local curricula, instruction, and assessment that meets local needs and resources and aids their students in achieving the mathematics standards for New York State. The Resource Guide contains lesson plans for mathematics, science, or technology classes as well as lessons that integrate them. The Mathematics Test Samplers for grades 4 and 8 were distributed in February 1998 and for Math A in May 1998.</td>

 The reasons for choosing the StrongARM are pretty straightforward. This means that it becomes perfectly feasible to imagine packing large numbers of StrongARMs in a very small space without having to worry about overheating (imagine trying to do the same thing with Pentium IIs). In addition, although the future of StrongARM was once in doubt (it was co-developed by Digital and Advanced Risc Machines), it has now been bought up by Intel who have recently announced that they will be investing heavilly in StrongARM development. The current top-of-the-range StrongARM runs at 233 MHz, and this is what Neil Carson is proposing to use in this first batch. However, in the not-too-distant future, there should be much faster StrongARMs with faster memory buses.</td>
