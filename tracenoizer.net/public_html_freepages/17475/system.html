 Location transparency is upheld by redirecting any location dependent. . It is a middle-ware running on top of the standard UNIX operating system that makes a cluster of computers to appear as a single, multi-processor machine to Java applications. Thread migration is supported by a novel approach called Delta Execution, where only the machine-independent part of a thread's execution context is migrated strategically. Location transparency is upheld by redirecting any location dependent.</td>

 "SGI is proud to collaborate with NASA Ames and its world-class scientists and engineers to help them analyze and solve America's most complex problems," said Anthony Robbins, president, SGI Federal. "Together we are pushing the boundaries of high-performance computing with the recent installation of a 512-processor SGI Origin 3800 modular supercomputer at NASA Ames that will be used by NASA scientists for groundbreaking research in the areas of aeronautics, earth sciences and life sciences. "We said to SGI, 'if you build a 512-CPU system using single system image, then we have a technique that will speed up processing about 10 times,'" Ziebarth said. "With large NASA computer codes, we are getting 10 times improvement in performance. " Working under a memorandum of agreement, NASA Ames and SGI have been cooperating in order to push the boundaries of high-performance computing.</td>
