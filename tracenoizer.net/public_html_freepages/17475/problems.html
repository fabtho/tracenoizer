 . With the largest single-kernel, shared-memory image available today, SGI Origin 3800 easily scales to 512 processors and a terabyte of memory. "SGI is proud to collaborate with NASA Ames and its world-class scientists and engineers to help them analyze and solve America's most complex problems," said Anthony Robbins, president, SGI Federal. "Together we are pushing the boundaries of high-performance computing with the recent installation of a 512-processor SGI Origin 3800 modular supercomputer at NASA Ames that will be used by NASA scientists for groundbreaking research in the areas of aeronautics, earth sciences and life sciences. "We said to SGI, 'if you build a 512-CPU system using single system image, then we have a technique that will speed up processing about 10 times,'" Ziebarth said.</td>

 Furthermore, not all of our software vendors have certified their respective applications for use with Windows XP. While Windows XP has many similarities to its predecessors, Windows 2000 and Windows NT, there are also many differences. In the months ahead, ITS Support Services will be working closely with ITS Administrative Systems and other technical groups to learn more about Windows XP to determine where compatibility problems exist with administrative applications and resolve them. Presently, there are no administrative applications that require the use of Windows XP or take advantage of new Windows XP features. Furthermore, Windows XP is not certified by ITS Support Services or ITS Administrative Systems for use on administrative desktop computers.</td>
