 But if you're looking for keen political satire in the guise of a rather bizarre romance, give this unusual and smartly written book a try. Leave it to my neighbor to once again come through on an excellent read. Watch Rosie obsession progress from GB's inauguration, through the Persion Gulf War, and finally to GB's last days in office. Her slightly demented logic and determination won me over instantly. Millet's narrative flows from one chapter to the next, never missing a beat.</td>
