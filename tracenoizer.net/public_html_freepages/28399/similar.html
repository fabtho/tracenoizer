 I am not clear as to what I need for the setup I have. .Anyway - I was glad to see a similar system, with similar questions. I hoping someone can help me narrow down my search for what I need. I started looking into Kimber, Cardas and stumbled onto Illuminations.</td>

 Thus, the additional variations that the Universe would present to man would not be that surprising. Size, shape, longevity of the coupling, and timing of mating or frequency of the routine are factors related to what the life form found was most successful during its evolution. Throughout the Universe, the most common size and shape arrangement is a similar size, due to the fact that most life forms are from water planets and conception occurs outside the body. Land creatures on Earth have emerged with the males aggressive and the females passive due in part to the number of carnivores on Earth. Males who exploded with rage when their territory was challenged and with great strength and resolve during the battle protected the females they had impregnated from becoming a meal, and thus passed their genes along.</td>
