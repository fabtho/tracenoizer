<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" Computer scientists want their courses to reflect the skills which computer scientists practice. On the other hand, computer literacy courses must also serve the needs as perceived by other departments. Therefore, the course employs common forms of applications software as tools. Students develop sufficient skills in those tools while concentrating on the problem solving aspects of the course. The course is aimed primarily to those students who do not intend to pursue the field of computer science further, in particular education majors.">
