 I am not clear as to what I need for the setup I have. .Anyway - I was glad to see a similar system, with similar questions. I hoping someone can help me narrow down my search for what I need. I started looking into Kimber, Cardas and stumbled onto Illuminations.</td>

 Syzygy programmers are well versed in a multitude of programming languages for a wide range of computer platforms. Exam Bank is an extremely popular site created and operated by Syzygy. com allows Alberta students the opportunity to practice for government tests through the use of questions used on past exams. Practice tests are currently available for Grades 3, 6, 9, and 12 - the grades in which government achievement tests and diploma exams are written. .</td>

 However, developing new courses along such lines raises the issue of training teachers. Designing a course that can best serve learners' interests and needs is an obstacle for many instructors. These are some of the questions that are often asked by many teachers. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to suggest a framework for an ESP course-development process that will help teachers with some of the problems they may come across in designing a new ESP course. With the spread of communicative language teaching (CLT), much emphasis in second language (L2) methodology has been paid to the learner-oriented instruction.</td>

 The current situation is such that the consensus requests teachers to assume the whole responsibility of assessing needs and of finding the best ways to satisfy them. They, however, need to wonder whether it is not after others have failed in satisfying needs that the task has been returned to them. Further, they also need to raise such simple questions as what it means to analyse the needs of a student. How can different needs of different students be satisfied in the same classroom. What are the needs which the teacher can or should care about.</td>
