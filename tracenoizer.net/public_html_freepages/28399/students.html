 Sysoyev, Tambov State University, Russia English for Specific Purposes (ESP) is a young and developing branch of EFL in Russia. Nazarova (1996) shows, for many years ESP instruction was limited to training special lexicon and translating numerous texts. Of course, such methods did not reflect students' interests and resulted in low learner motivation and poor participation. With the spread of the student-centered approach in Russia and the continued increase of international contacts in various spheres, much attention has been paid to the design of ESP courses that can prepare students for professional communication. However, developing new courses along such lines raises the issue of training teachers.</td>

Students develop sufficient skills in those tools while concentrating on the problem solving aspects of the course. The course is aimed primarily to those students who do not intend to pursue the field of computer science further, in particular education majors. The new service course addresses serious problem solving or reasoning issues - in the context of computer applications.</td>

 After having done some studies in which we have documented the omnipresence and the strength of this linearity illusion, the present project aims at unravelling - by means of individual interviews - the reasons for students' tendency to apply linear reasoning in problem situations for which it is not suited and at developing, implementing and testing a powerful learning environment at overcoming this tendency. .
