<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" In addition to these factors, some seriously constraining observations about language and about learning it have been made in anthropological, linguistics and communication theories. These observations have come to the front as a result of breakthroughs which include (i) advances in human rights, (ii) the sociological recognition that a person cannot be confined into a preset and frozen social, cultural or political role, (iii) that learning a language opens new communication circles and thus makes new aspirations and expectations possible and legitimate. Because of these features of language, learning it, acquiring it and using it are highly individual experiences driven by different motivations for each member of a group of learners and determined by a set of objective constraints which vary from one member of the same group to another one. The shift, however, is occurring within the traditional paradigm of ELT and language acquisition theory. Focusing on the learner to better serve her and accommodate her various motivations is in no way a new trend in the profession.">

 After having done some studies in which we have documented the omnipresence and the strength of this linearity illusion, the present project aims at unravelling - by means of individual interviews - the reasons for students' tendency to apply linear reasoning in problem situations for which it is not suited and at developing, implementing and testing a powerful learning environment at overcoming this tendency. .
