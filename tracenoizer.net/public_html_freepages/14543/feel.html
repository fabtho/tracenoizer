<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" The video that is apparently catching people's attention shows a man killing a kitten, butchering it, and then cooking it. I haven't seen the video that's catching people's attention, and I don't plan to. To be honest, the idea of the video is making me feel very uneasy right now. I have seven cats of my own, and while I joke about them being sandwiches for a month (some of them are pretty fat) after a nuclear war, the idea of eating Lefty brings up the beginnings of a gag reflex. I refuse to be part of any lynch mob that goes after him.">

 You've been to the vet and the store to get all the supplies he'll need. From your new cat's perspective, your home is a big, unfamiliar place. Being in a private, quiet room, your newcomer will feel comfortable to investigate his new territory and figure out where his necessities are located. The food and water should be placed on the opposite wall of the litter box. Cats don't eliminate where they eat, so put the food and water as far away from the box as possible.</td>

 I think naked pictures of me would be a terrible form of child abuse. I only wish it were to involve vodka, but alas, my well runneth dry. However, I am not ashamed of who I am so I feel like giving you the bad with the good if it interests you. I know some of you come here for my pissy commentary but sometimes I am not in that mood, though I quickly fall back into it. I am the one updating it now so you can send submissions to me.</td>
