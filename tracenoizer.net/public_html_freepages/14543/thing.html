 . This is just good, melodic rock that isn't afraid to knock you out with some punk rock and then sweep your dirty ass off the floor with some punchy melodies. The only thing holding it back, though, is the vocals. They're too dirty, too gritty for the sharp melodies the band is capable of. A nice contrast at times, but after awhile it just gets on your nerves and you start longing for the music more than the vocals.</td>

 Both foot-binding and head-binding were practiced in the Far East, for the purpose of miniaturizing the feet and shaping the head into attractive shapes. This technique is also the principle behind the well-known corset, which is regaining popularity in recent years. By physically constraining the growth of a developing living thing, it can be directed to take the shape of the vessel that constrains it. Just as a topiary gardener produces bushes that take the forms of animals or any other thing, you no longer need be satisfied with a housepet having the same mundane shape as all other members of its species. With Bonsai Kitten, a world of variation awaits you, limited only by your own imagination.</td>
