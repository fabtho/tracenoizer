 I'm sure Alex Kingston will break it next week as well. We won't talk about how I sobbed and sobbed when Carter cleaned out your locker and the way he pulled your nametag off the locker it was like pulling a band-aid off. I've been thinking of things to say, things I want to say, but I've just been busy and a little frustrated. Plus with Lewin away, rather than having him all night to talk to at my leisure, I've got a one hour block of time at the end of my night. You really take time for granted when you're living with someone.</td>
