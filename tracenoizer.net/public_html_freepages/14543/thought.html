 There has to be a better way to find your classmates or if you're feeling pedantic, then substitute with class mates. . I just thought it was interesting looking, particularly the caffeine one, since I can easily down 3 liters of Dr Pepper daily. I would definitely like to see the web of a spider on amphetamines or something similar. I was doing my standard runnning around on sites after I posted that, and found what will probably be the next "Bonsai Kitten" like hatefest.</td>

 . I coud handle this on a normal night, but it's very windy out right now. I thought I was over sitting with all the lights on hoping the ghosts don't come. I can't really remember feeling this way since 7th grade. And the wind violently shakes the trees and makes the branches scratcha nd tap against the windows and roof and all I want to do it hide my head under the pillow so I don't hear all the scarey nioses and fall asleep.</td>
