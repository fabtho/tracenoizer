 a full raging fire that tells you-this the direction. Willie and Aubrey Williams clearly had the vision to start KEXS Radio in the early sixties. Today, I have the privilege and the honor to take that vision and bring the message to more people than ever before. AM 1090 KEXS is Kansas City's original Southern Gospel music station. Our result for our advertising clients is exceptional.</td>

 NBC Studios NBC is headquartered at 30 Rockefeller Center, the 70-story tower situated behind the Prometheus statue. To learn more about the studio tours (which are popular and are sold on a first come, first served basis), see our related article. The Today Show, another member of the NBC family, does more than just offer tours. Their studio, behind sidewalk-level showcase windows at 10 Rockefeller Plaza, is basically open for public viewing. Today broadcasts often feature the faces of tourists pressed against the glass, and from time to time, Katie Courac and Matt Lauer will actually go out and speak to the crowd.</td>
