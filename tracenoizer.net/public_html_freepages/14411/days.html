 is far from an agreement to settle claims by New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer that the biggest brokerage misled investors with biased stock research, Spitzer said. SPORTS Stocks Showing They Can Sustain Gains It would be easy to conclude from the U. stock market's rise and fall in the past couple of days that share prices just aren't capable of sustaining gains this year.

 Maybe a small television too if you are a news junky but not if you will not be disciplined enough to ignore the soaps and game shows. A computer -- it should be reasonably new enough to run current software. Relatively inexpensive these days and the output look way more professional than an ink-jet or that old dot matrix. Add a little spice to those proposals with pictures. Keep some recent backups off-site perhaps at a friend's house or in a bank safety deposit box.</td>

 I also did a brief bass-playing stint for Smile, another Dunedin band, in mid-1998, and again in mid-1999. Smile have a cool new CD out entitled "Fear of Flying", and another one in the pipeline already. These days I tend to play more guitar than bass, and I've done a bit of multitrack recording on my Amiga (primarily guitar-based rock); I might provide a few audio clips and photos on this page later if I can be bothered. Foo Fighters When the Foo Fighters' self-titled debut album was released, I foolishly assumed that they would be a cheap Nirvana spin-off. Juliana Hatfield Deceptively sweet and simple songs express heartfelt and often tragic emotion.</td>
