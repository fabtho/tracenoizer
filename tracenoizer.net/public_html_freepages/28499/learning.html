However, over the last ten years, these theoretical constructs have been confirmed many times by exact measurements taken during an actual learning process A simple simulation model makes it possible to predict the outcome of a long-term learning process based on spaced repetition. Probability of forgetting at each repetition is determined by the forgetting index. A significant loss of memory with aging can be observed only as a result of a pathological process or because of lack of training (Restak 1984).">

 In short, teachers and students must be immersed in contextual teaching and learning, and supported in their use of the REACT strategy. . Center for Occupation Research and Development - What We Know About the Learning Process Contextual Learning Resources What Is Contextual Learning. We can further conclude from the studies of Caine and Caine that connectedness is a key to effective learning. In the last forty years, only a few alterations in the content of elementary and secondary education have been necessary.</td>

 Steve Paterson and Barry Richmond, Stella II Technical Documentation, High Performance Systems Inc. . Dynamic Modeling of a Learning Process Dynamic Modeling of a Learning Process N. This effort is a comprehensive combination of the Education metrics and Engineering computer programs where major variables of a learning process are investigated and modeled based on a system approach. The main focus is on the study of relationship between structure and behavior of the system.</td>
