 Steve Paterson and Barry Richmond, Stella II Technical Documentation, High Performance Systems Inc. . Dynamic Modeling of a Learning Process Dynamic Modeling of a Learning Process N. This effort is a comprehensive combination of the Education metrics and Engineering computer programs where major variables of a learning process are investigated and modeled based on a system approach. The main focus is on the study of relationship between structure and behavior of the system.</td>

 In short, teachers and students must be immersed in contextual teaching and learning, and supported in their use of the REACT strategy. . Center for Occupation Research and Development - What We Know About the Learning Process Contextual Learning Resources What Is Contextual Learning. We can further conclude from the studies of Caine and Caine that connectedness is a key to effective learning. In the last forty years, only a few alterations in the content of elementary and secondary education have been necessary.</td>

 . Most of the figures and formulas have been theoretically derived. However, over the last ten years, these theoretical constructs have been confirmed many times by exact measurements taken during an actual learning process A simple simulation model makes it possible to predict the outcome of a long-term learning process based on spaced repetition. Probability of forgetting at each repetition is determined by the forgetting index. A significant loss of memory with aging can be observed only as a result of a pathological process or because of lack of training (Restak 1984).</td>
