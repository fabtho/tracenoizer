 Rodolfo Rosales is Associate Professor of Social and Policy Sciences at the University of Texas at San Antonio. .95, paperback The Illusion of Inclusion The Untold Political Story of San Antonio By Rodolfo Rosales "Imaginative and rich political science. Rosales' analysis of middle-class Chicano activism in the early postwar era is both a new and an important contribution to our knowledge of San Antonio's and Texas' recent political history. Yet, nearly twenty years later, inclusion is still largely an illusion for many working-class and poor Chicanas and Chicanos, since business interests continue to set the city's political and economic priorities.</td>

The religious right was back, in a new and fascinating form, the reports of its demise having been greatly exaggerated. It was a dramatic story, of a well-funded, tax-exempt organization that was using highly sophisticated techniques to train members all over the country to seize control of local and state Republican party committees, while working at the same time to re-elect George Bush.</td>

 In this ideology of art the role of the artist is not to make the revolution but to prepare its way through clarification, analysis and exposure, to provide people with a vision and a belief that a revolution is necessary, possible and desirable. . Compared to most of their Western counterparts who tend to wield little influence and pressure on the power process, many contemporary African filmmakers participate actively in the affairs of society at all levels and are more overtly committed to the challenges of social and political reconstruction and renewal. They are part of the intellectual elite with a sharp awareness of the internal dynamics of their society and the larger world with which it interacts, but they are also the most severe critics and challengers of this elite as well as the socio-political status quo. For many African filmmakers, political independence from colonial rule did not change the lot of ordinary people.</td>
