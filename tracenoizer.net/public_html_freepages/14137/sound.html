 The attendance came from not only Tokyo but also other cities such as Kanazawa, Kobe, Niigata, Nagoya and Nagano. 1, How to make art events and to apply for art grants (Speaker-Seiji Shimoda;performance artist, NIPAF executive director) To give self-expression such as exhibition as well as performance art is to give Events. This means artists have to have a sound financial plans and to know how to advertise effectively as well as to considerate of the content and quality of their works. In Japan, although we are getting more foundations to support art activities little by little, public grants haven't been so available for young artists yet because of its confusing rules on application. We introduced some typical forms of project statements and papers, explained what kind of art activities those foundations tend to accept and taught how to advertise effectively.</td>
