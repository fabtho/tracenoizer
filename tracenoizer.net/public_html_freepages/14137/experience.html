 What do performance artists consider their 'materials' to be. How well does performance art 'travel' from one scenario to the next. What can the public experience of the performance artist's process. What happens when artists work in a community rather than in isolation.

 The course is committed to retaining a balance between new digital media and traditional craft-based media. Emphasis is placed on the theoretical context within which studio work is pursued, and is supported by a well-focused Humanities programme of lectures, seminars and individual tutorials. The increasing number of students following research degrees at MPhil and PhD level also contributes to the rich mixture of ideas, experience and culture. The course is especially committed to the development of an international perspective, reflecting the global nature of the discipline. The SALVO project is a School publishing project producing limited-edition publications by students, staff and graduates which will be sent to major museums, galleries and individuals throughout the world, as well as being available for sale.</td>

What the screaming child doesn't realise is that he is witnessing performance art. McCarthy, who is based in Cork, is walking - and standing still - around the streets of London's Southwark as part of an ongoing performance work entitled What Do You Do When You Get There and There Is No There There, which centres on the Irish experience of emigration. " The stallholder emits a nervous cough of laughter as he contemplates McCarthy, now rigid in the middle of a shopping precinct. " He walks away, twirling his finger in his ear to indicate untreatable idiocy.</td>
