 The more removed we are held within the protection of our second skin the more divorced we become from truth, compassion and justice; from reality, nature and life. Ethnic cleansing becomes global cleansing via inquisition technology. The human body and by associafion, all life becomes reduced to the unknowing and disempowered object of surveillance. de Das Copyright fuer ASA-Beitraege liegt uneingeschraenkt beim ASA-Koeln Das Copyright fuer Beitraege von anderen Quellen liegt bei dem jeweiligen Autor . .</td>

 5, The efficacy of Alternative Healing way (Speaker; Hiromitsu Azuma; Alternative doctor in Thailand) In this modern society who has a lot of new super pathogen, fighting with them by making up ones immune system seems to be similar to contemporary art which goes against Commercialism and Epicureanism. Compared to western modern medicine whose reliability has been getting doughtful lately, Alternative medicine can be a great natural cure which put emphasis on one's recoverability. We learned its ideas about human body, simple exercises to reset distortion in one's body,taking urine as a nutrient and the heat cure. We can call him the living witness of contemporary art. Because he is well known as a sound poet and contemporary artist, and is a gentle and broad minded person, he has many friends among artists all over the world.</td>
