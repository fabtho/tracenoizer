 Procaccino molded his clueless, very American character quite beautifully and three-dimensionally, and the guy's mental collapse was perversely satisfying. New City's production of King Lear was slightly over a year ago, but this stellar theater-lobby experience must be told. During the performance, I sat in an aisle seat and quietly followed the play from a small paperback book as the actors performed. After the show, I was standing in the hallway like a reasonable Joe when the woman who'd played Gloucester accosted me furiously. She said I had completely distracted the actors by reading from a book, and that they all had messed up their entrances because of me, and that they were all talking about me back in the green room.</td>
