 Anybody at the performance art festival Full Nelson who witnessed Irish artist Andre Stitt destroy an entire wall with his bare hands and set it aflame, to the horrifying accompaniment of singing puppets, will never recover. I want to move to Hollywood and burn down his house. Either way, it left a mustard-colored indelible stain on my memory. ADRIAN RYAN At the top of my list is the show I didn't review, but loved above all others. Everyone who is anyone good in Seattle theater turned out to do his or her fabulous thing for the burned-out performers.</td>
