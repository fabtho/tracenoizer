 What he'd hit was a group of swingers who were exchanging digital videos of themselves having sex with their partners. A sort of a safe sex on-line orgy with the participants telling each other what perversions they'd like to see acted out. McMara had never considered getting his wife to pee in his mouth before, and he'd never licked her bottom, but after being asked to perform these things on camera, he found they were fun. That was, until he had to pay ten grand to prevent the videos he'd swapped with other swingers from being circulated amongst his neighbours. McMara had to cough up the readies, it wasn't as if he or Michelle were celebrities - they had reputations to maintain.</td>

Then John Duykers again almost saving the day, as much as it could be saved, as the Visitor in the otherwise bizarrely wrong and utterly disappointing Philip Glass wreck of Kafka's In the Penal Colony at ACT. Walking into the John Jesurun set of New City Theater's beautiful, brainy Snow.</td>
