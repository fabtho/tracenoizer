 Current industrial laser processes include heat treatment, welding, drilling, cutting and scribing. Current practice in laser machining has been limited to high-speed, repetitive drilling or cutting of single workpiece material in either a production line or job shop environment. The effort and cost associated with calibration of an operating point with acceptable material removal rate, surface quality and dimensional accuracy for a different workpiece geometry or material become high for low-batch or prototyping applications. This limitation is particularly apparent in laser blanking or fabrication processes, where the flexibility of laser systems over turret punch presses has been much touted but largely unrealized due to the difficulty in planning decisions for small-batch or prototype production. The engine for the process planning tool is a set of theoretical models for laser machining focused on the features of the laser-machined part.</td>

 Alternatively, the user may define new processes, and a newly defined process can be added to the library and accessed repeatedly. The CIPROS discrete-event simulator simulates the execution of the construction plan for a user-specified number of replications. It produces statistical reports for management review which are instrumental to assessing the quality of a construction plan and identifying areas for improvement. The system thus augments construction plans with knowledge pertaining to the interaction and characteristics of construction components and resources, and it models the uncertainty inherent to construction operations.

 Process planning is very time-consuming and the results vary based on the person doing the planning. When a new part was introduced, the process plan for that family would be manually retrieved, marked-up and retyped. While this improved productivity, it did not improve the quality of the planning of processes and it did not easily take into account the differences between parts in a family nor improvements in production processes. Computer-aided process planning initially evolved as a means to electronically store a process plan once it was created, retrieve it, modify it for a new part and print the plan (Stage II). Other capabilities of this stage are table-driven cost and standard estimating systems.</td>
