 Among many professional affiliations, he is past President and currently on the Board of the Society of Concurrent Engineering and is a member of the Product Development Management Association and the Engineering Management Society. . COMPUTER-AIDED PROCESS PLANNING Computer-aided process planning (CAPP) tools and approach described. Product Development Forum NPD Body of Knowledge CAPP Software Design Automation Paper DRM Associates INTRODUCTION Process planning translates design information into the process steps and instructions to efficiently and effectively manufacture products. As the design process is supported by many computer-aided tools, computer-aided process planning (CAPP) has evolved to simplify and improve process planning and achieve more effective use of manufacturing resources.</td>

 Further, operation of different processes may compete for the same pool of resources. Functions of operations complement the simulation network and enable the user to model complex resource interactions utilization strategies. For each process and using the library of construction techniques and methods, the user may select the technique and method and provide additional information regarding resource availability and utilization policies, process input and output, and operation durations. Alternatively, the user may define new processes, and a newly defined process can be added to the library and accessed repeatedly. The CIPROS discrete-event simulator simulates the execution of the construction plan for a user-specified number of replications.</td>
