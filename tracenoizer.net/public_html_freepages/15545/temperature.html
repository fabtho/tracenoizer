 Project the transparency of the Thermometer Placement black line master. Explain that you want the students to make some hypotheses of how the temperatures in the classroom will change from location to location and from the beginning to the end of the school day. Hand out copies of the Temperature Hypotheses Worksheet black line master to each group and project a transparency of this handout. Give the groups about 15 minutes to answer their questions and compose their justification. Give the class an opportunity to react to each group's hypotheses.</td>

 Hansen and his colleagues generated the first three-dimensional computer simulations of global climate that revealed how dramatic increases in greenhouse gases in the past 100 years--a result mainly of the burning of fossil fuels--were trapping a growing quantity of heat in the lower atmosphere. Some of the most recent computer models predict warming of up to five degrees Celsius by the middle of the century. One of the sturdiest pillars of the argument against global warming has crumbled under the weight of some 10 million newly compiled measurements of ocean temperature. Hansen of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York and his colleagues reported in 1997 that the earth is absorbing about 0. 5 watt per square meter of sunlight more than it is emitting back to space.</td>

 Taha, who is in the Environmental Energy Technologies Division, has been running computer simulations of the air quality in Los Angeles to test the effectiveness of these air pollution reduction strategies. His studies will help the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) decide if it is worth boosting efforts at urban revegetation and re-roofing buildings with materials that efficiently reflect solar radiation. "Past research has demonstrated that increasing urban vegetation and coating roofs with paint or roofing material that is highly reflective to sunlight can reduce the temperature of the urban heat island," says Taha. "We think that these methods can also reduce the formation of photochemical smog. " The heat island effect is an elevation of temperature of urban areas relative to the surrounding countryside caused by the removal of vegetation, and the use of materials such as asphalt that absorb the sun's heat.</td>
