 Industry Reports Click Here for news done right, AnandTech-style. But how do you cool Athlon MP processors in a case that's less than 2" tall. Read on as our resident cooling expert, Tillmann Steinbrecher puts all of the latest coolers through their paces and makes predictions for the future of socketed CPU cooling. The quest for more efficient cooling techniques has lead companies to experiment with everything from conventional air cooling to refrigeration. SENFU International Information Corp, a small Taiwanese company feels that water cooling is a potential solution to the problem.</td>
