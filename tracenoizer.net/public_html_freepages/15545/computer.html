 Due to the one-of-a-kind nature of the NHP200NC, reproduction is impossible and orders are thus futile. . So do we, but instead of drilling holes and windows out of our computer cases to install cold cathodes, fans and plexiglass, we simply left the case away this time. But they're all heavy, rectangular and following a 20 year old de-facto standard. We wanted to change this and thought about a way how to transform a lab computer (just the parts put together, no case (as seen in testing labs at various websites)) into a portable shape.</td>
