 His passing and defence are far better than many give him credit for. . Neil Jenkins Neil Jenkins Jinks became the first player ever to score 1000 points in international rugby. There has been talk of this being his last tournament, but he has still maintained the form that makes him one of the best fly halves in the world It's all about Jonny and Jinks. Many see Wilkinson as having a better all round game, but Jenkins is still a fine fly half to have in your side.</td>
