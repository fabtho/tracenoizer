 Screensavers MICHAEL LYNAGH Just when you were ready to write Neil Jenkins out of the Lions tour to Australia he comes up with a performance like that against France last Saturday. Well, that may still happen, but he certainly has ensured that his name is now underlined as a certainty to tour and no doubt will be high on the discussion list when the first test side is chosen. Given their recent showing it was going to be hard for Henry to justify selecting more that a handful of Welshmen in the touring side.

 Don't belt the ball, as this will only ruin your practising and try to keep calm. . It is very hard to do unless you constantly practice. Tonight I practised for 1hr trying different techniques, until I found one that I was comfortable with and one that I didn't feel I had to belt the ball with. To begin with work out where you leg naturally swings by using sand and kicking a lump on the ground and see the spread.</td>

 Every time a kick was lined up against Japan, John Rowlands, the sand carrier, was reminding him of how many points were needed. Despite missing two earlier chances in the following game against Samoa, Jenkins secured the record on his third kick. I'm just a boy from the valleys and it is still hard to think of my name being associated with the legends of the past". Nicknamed the 'Ginger Monster', Jenkins has put his critics to rest with his record-breaking performance for Wales over the last few years. Click here to join the debate on our discussion board.</td>

 I wouldn't have thought there has ever been a more consistent goal-kicker to have played rugby. When he retires, he will be a difficult man to replace. Jonny Wilkinson and Ronan O'Gara, not to mention the most recent Lions fly-half Gregor Townsend, may have a few things to say on the matter, but you would be hard-pressed to get Jenkins himself to speak about it. As ever, he remained a model of modesty after his match-winning performance. 'The most important thing is the team,' he insisted.</td>
