 Welsh Rugby - SIX NATIONS CHAMPIONSHIP REVIEW Six Nations Championship '2001 Review With just two wins out of five, Wales' 2001 championship campaign was mediocre. Wales were the better side for the first ten minutes and almost took the lead when Dafydd James had a try disallowed. England continued to control the game during the second half when Greenwood went over to complete his hat-trick. Wales began the game well, with a drop goal from Neil Jenkins after just 17 seconds. Wales began the second half well, as Mark Taylor intercepted a Scotland pass to score under the posts.</td>

 Neil Jenkins Neil Jenkins Jinks became the first player ever to score 1000 points in international rugby. There has been talk of this being his last tournament, but he has still maintained the form that makes him one of the best fly halves in the world It's all about Jonny and Jinks. Many see Wilkinson as having a better all round game, but Jenkins is still a fine fly half to have in your side. His passing and defence are far better than many give him credit for. .</td>
