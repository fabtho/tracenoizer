 Untitled Document All's Fair in Bugs and War November 11, 1997By Erin K. The best thing this film has going for it, aside from the phenomenal special effects, is the fact that it doesn't take itself too seriously. When I saw the movie previews, I figured I had no desire to see an army full of Generation X-ers with flawless skin and perfect teeth shoot at rampaging arachnids.

 . The screenplay ended up being so close to the original source material that producer Jon Davison was spurred to investigate the rights for Heinlein's novel. Surprisingly, he found that the movie rights had never been picked up, and very quickly the rip-off became the real thing. Fresh out of high school in Buenos Aires, Johnny Rico (Casper Van Dien) and his girlfriend Carmen Ibanez (Denise Richards) sign up for military service (see what years of underfunding and the free-reign of market forces does to post-secondary education. He gets sent to Mobile Infantry, and she goes to be a pilot in the Fleet Academy.</td>

 Casper Van Dien plays Johnny Rico (you have to love the name) who goes off and joins the military to impress his arrogant girlfriend, Carmen (Denise Richards). Soon after joining, Johnny finds out that Buenos Aires has been wiped off the map by giant bugs from the planet Klendathu. How in God's name can you be serious in a movie about people fighting giant bugs. The bugs are the best thing about this movie, yet they only serve the purpose of getting shot by the stars, and to occasionally dismember one of the less important characters. No effort is ever made to understand the bugs, to figure out what they want, or even to find newer and better ways to kill them than with machine guns.</td>
