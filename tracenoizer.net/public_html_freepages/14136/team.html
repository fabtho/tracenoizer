<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" . In a game between Wales and Samoa in the 1999 Rugby World Cup, he surpassed Michael Lynagh's1 record of 911 points. Despite heavy criticism during most of his international career, which began as a teenager against England in 1991, Jenkins has remained an almost permanent feature on the Welsh team since he was first picked. Although he is not a great creative fly-half in the manner of Barry John or Phil Bennett, Jenkins frequently plays at full-back2, but his solid virtues command attention, and his style of play naturally fits with the flat back-line favoured by Wales' New Zealand-born coach Graham Henry. Lynagh has said Jenkins' achievement was far greater than his own, as Jenkins played most of his games for a team, that could be described as mediocre at best.">

 Well, that may still happen, but he certainly has ensured that his name is now underlined as a certainty to tour and no doubt will be high on the discussion list when the first test side is chosen. Given their recent showing it was going to be hard for Henry to justify selecting more that a handful of Welshmen in the touring side. His Welsh team are back on track and now he can pick a few of them for the tour. His try was the best this season and showed what a player he is. On the hard, fast grounds of Australia, his pace and ability to beat people will be valuable.</td>

 The only good thing that can be said about the change is that, if it had to be made, it was better now, with plenty of time until the World Cup. But Henry does not deserve all the criticism that has been aimed at him. The problem has been the team's collapse in the last year, which has coincided with the loss of some key players. It is easy to forget that Neil Jenkins carried the team for Henry, with his organisation of the defence and his passing. He lay flat, with Allan Bateman and Scott Gibbs to get over the gain line.</td>

 It was ironic that he made his second City debut against Gresley Rovers as they were the team the he made his one and only start against in his previous spell. . He originally took the 'team co-ordinator' role but has since become first team manager with former boss Brian Godfrey as his assistant. It was Godfrey who originally signed Tommy in the early nineties, and Tommy repaid him with a string of fine performances in the heart of the Tigers midfield. He also cut his managerial teeth at the Lawn when he took over from Paul Collicutt as Gregan's assistant.</td>
