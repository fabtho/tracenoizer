 Neil Jenkins Neil Jenkins Jinks became the first player ever to score 1000 points in international rugby. There has been talk of this being his last tournament, but he has still maintained the form that makes him one of the best fly halves in the world It's all about Jonny and Jinks. Many see Wilkinson as having a better all round game, but Jenkins is still a fine fly half to have in your side. His passing and defence are far better than many give him credit for. .</td>

 As ever, he remained a model of modesty after his match-winning performance. 'The most important thing is the team,' he insisted. France came at us left, right and centre during the first half, but Rob's try was a key point in the game. We could have caved in during that first half, but there are some big characters in this team. ' One of those big characters is captain David Young, another anxious candidate for Henry's Lions squad.</td>
