 After the game, Wales coach Graham Henry expressed his disappointment at the loss and called Wales' Six Nations campaign "mediocre. . Welsh Rugby - SIX NATIONS CHAMPIONSHIP REVIEW Six Nations Championship '2001 Review With just two wins out of five, Wales' 2001 championship campaign was mediocre. Wales were the better side for the first ten minutes and almost took the lead when Dafydd James had a try disallowed. England continued to control the game during the second half when Greenwood went over to complete his hat-trick.</td>

 The star of the back line was Shane Howarth who had a blistering performance at full back, looking sharp in attack and defence and faultless under the high ball. . Wales scored a try either side of half time to ensure victory but it was a jittery and unconvincing performance. Nerves seem to play the biggest part in the match and the Wales will have to step up a gear for their remaining pool games against Japan and Samoa if they are to qualify as group winners and retain home advantage for the Quarter Finals. To be fair Wales were always the more dangerous side and never looked like conceding a try but Gonzalo Quesada kept the Argentineans in touch by kicking 6 penalties out of 7 attempts.</td>
