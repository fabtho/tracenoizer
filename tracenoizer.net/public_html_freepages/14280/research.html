 7th Heaven still airs in syndication Monday through Friday in addition to its regular Monday night time slot. . Stephen was recently on Rosie and The View talking about the scientific research that shows how Transcendental Meditation (TM) can be a tool to stop violence and terrorism in the world. If you want to hear more about this amazing research, click here. (By the way, a few people who have heard Stephen talk about this seem to think that TM is a religion, but it's not.</td>

 Stephen Turner's Home Page Stephen Turner Work Until recently I was an academic, in the Statistical Laboratory, University of Cambridge. I've given it up now though, and I'm considering my next move. My research was on stochastic networks; that's to do with mathematical problems in communications networks. You can still get a list of my research publications. You can even download some of them, including my Ph.</td>

 . His parents, William and Joyce Robinson, reside in Moraga, California. While at Ames, Robinson earned masters and doctorate degrees in mechanical engineering at Stanford University, with research emphasis in turbulence physics, and additional research in human eye dynamics. In 1990, Robinson was selected as Chief of the Experimental Flow Physics Branch at NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, where he led a group of 35 engineers and scientists engaged in aerodynamics and fluid physics research. As an MVL team-member, he conducted neurovestibular research on astronauts on the Spacelab Life Sciences 2 Shuttle mission (STS-58).</td>
