 By providing methods of determining which problems are soluble, Kleene's work led to the study of which functions can be computed. From 1930's on Kleene more than any other mathematician developed the notions of computability and effective process in all their forms both abstract and concrete, both mathematical and philosophical. He tended to lay the foundations for an area and then move on to the next, as each successive one blossomed into a major research area in his wake. Kleene's best known books are Introduction to Metamathematics (1952) and Mathematical Logic (1967). .</td>

 1974, University of Arizona Areas of Interest Large-Scale Structures; Superclusters; Cosmic Voids; AGN Galaxies Undergraduate Education; Public Outreach Brief Description of Research Gregory is the co-discoverer (with L. These are the largest organized systems known to humans. Clearly, the existence of these large structures is a major clue about how the Universe formed. His current research projects employ large, statistically complete samples of galaxies for which he has observed the spectra in the whole range of optical light. These samples are used to better identify structures and to test the physical conditions within them.</td>
