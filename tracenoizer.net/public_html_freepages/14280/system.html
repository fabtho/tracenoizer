 help Kodak Carousel Tray Compatibility with Non-Kodak 35mm Projectors I recently had my Kodak 650h slide projector die on me (apparently with a broken clutch spring). This repair cost is not worth the price of the slide projector. Unfortunately, I need a Kodak tray compatible system (for reasons not relevant to my question). I have heard that there are non-Kodak projectors available that are compatible with the Kodak tray system (Carousel trays. not AV trays), but have been unsucessful in finding them (locally in Toronto, or on the web).</td>
