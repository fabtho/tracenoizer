 Every student is assigned a specific area upstairs for shelving, shelf-reading, pickups, and straightening. Books are prepared for shelving on the sorting shelves in the hallway. Books should be filed on the shelves in correct call number order. Then, books in a specific call number range can be off-loaded onto a book truck for shelving on the third floor. Once in a while, the sorting shelves will overflow.</td>
