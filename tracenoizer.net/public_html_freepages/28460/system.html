<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" Since the mice obviously had no X-ray vision, nor the capability to practice genealogy, they drew the conclusion that they were sniffing each other's urine for a genetic difference; several experiments later, they were convinced that the sense of smell was definitely the key. Intrigued, other scientists began manipulating genotypes to see just how few genes would have to be different before the mice would toss out their inhibitions. Researchers Kunio Yamazaki and Gary Beauchamp discovered that the major histocompatability complex, a string of genes that code for proteins involved in the immune system, was the key to all of this (Young 1988). All they had to do was manipulate a single gene on the MHC, and the mice would smell enough of a difference to mate. More testing was then done to hopefully confirm the idea of MHC involvement in personal odor.">

 Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service and the Texas Animal Damage Control Association, a private organization. Achievements TWDMS has received special recognition from the USDA for its participation in the field testing and implementation of the Texas Oral Rabies Project. This project has been critical to the development of an oral rabies vaccine and delivery system to immunize coyotes and gray fox in the wild. Last year, TWDMS cooperated in the aerial distribution of 2. 6 million oral rabies vaccine baits covering an area of 42,000 square miles.</td>
