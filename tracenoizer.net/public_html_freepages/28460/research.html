 It makes sense when you consider that the MHC is responsible for producing glycoproteins that sit on most cell surfaces in the body like name tags; these name tags say "Don't eat me. " when the cells of the immune system are on the prowl for foreigners. Now, this is all still a little ambiguous, but more and more research is being done to investigate this idea. Two ideas of how the MHC has accomplished its name tagging on a organismal level have been hypothesized. First, since the MHC is a strand of genes that is different for everyone, these genes code for different proteins (Young 1988).</td>
