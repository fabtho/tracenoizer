 I just found an interview with my pal Jessamyn on some site called The Margin. The interview breaks down into about three quarters anarchism, one quarter librarian stuff. Interviews are always tough because people don't talk the way they write, and when you're listening to someone it's easier to follow a tangential conversation and filter out verbal tics. When I used to do Retrogression (my old punk zine) I always had a hard time transcribing interviews. Second of all, I never knew how much to "transcribe" and how much to "interpret" for the reader.</td>
