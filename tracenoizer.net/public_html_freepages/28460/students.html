 There is also an option for a graduate certificate in technical communication. Option 1 - the English Department offers an undergraduate program called a cognate (similar to a minor) in technical writing. Students with majors in the Liberal Arts should plan early to take courses in technical or scientific fields. Students with technical majors should consult the Business and Technical Writing Director for current requirements. Visit the technical communication careers and alumni pages, too.</td>

 This activity is identified as kinesthetic learning. The groups are given a combination of coins and dollars and instructed to find and write the total. This consists of students working on two Student Pages from the student edition. The teacher guide provides a paragraph or two of guidance for using each of these pages. One nice feature of the student materials is that the page numbers appear both in numeric form and in words at the bottom of each page.</td>
