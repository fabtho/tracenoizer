 A strong-yet-flexible technology backbone is essential to the Corporate Supplier Model. This three-tier system is designed to process, track and store crucial information about orders quickly, easily and efficiently. Because of this architecture, our systems not only route communications, but also capture the critical data our customers need in order to monitor their buying patterns and spending habits. Our customizable systems report and analyze the data, helping our customers discover and eliminate hidden costs in their procurement process. Corporate Express realized significant returns from its investment in technology during fiscal 1997, including the conversion of its National Accounts program from an order-capture system to an integrated strategic system.</td>
