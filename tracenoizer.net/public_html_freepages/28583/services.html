<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" From the start, Corporate Express was determined to engineer a technology architecture that could easily manage a high-and continuously expanding-daily volume of orders, fulfillments and deliveries. Our North American operations alone received and processed more than 12 million orders during fiscal 1997. Since many of these orders were for multiple items or services, this translates into hundreds of millions of purchases-each one carefully tracked from receipt through next-day delivery. This technological infrastructure guarantees the realization of the Corporate Express goal-a completely integrated and transparent ordering, processing, fulfillment and payment system for all its customers worldwide. From consolidated multi-location invoicing to customized procurement management, it is the Company's goal to provide its customers with a "virtual" supply of all the non-production goods and services a large company needs-without the customer ever needing to pick up a phone or wrestle with a paper form.">

Middleware, as an integral part of the infrastructure, powers the business applications. This middleware must be flexible and robust; it needs to provide rich functionality; and it should implement open standards such as J2EE and Web services. The availability of a complete portfolio of middleware on Linux from IBM has helped software vendors build business applications quickly.
