 . (PAGE FIFTEEN) REVOLUTIONARY INTERNATIONALISM AND PAN-AFRICANISM (PAGE SIXTEEN) ALLIANCES WITH WHITES (PAGE NINETEEN) INTRODUCTION The following is political overview and statement of general political positions. We have written these political positions form the perspective of the Armed Front because we feel that such a perspective is needed in the total revolutionary process for Black liberation. We are general in our public statement because we are essentially a military and political front, therefore it would not do to speak in any other terms, for the actions of the armed front will address themselves to the specifics of our people's national oppression. We do not wish the ENEMY to gain tactical insight in carrying out his repressive campaigns, while on the other hand we do desire that the Black Liberation Movement understand the correct role armed struggle plays in a peoples struggle and how this role is in motion for us here in North American.</td>
