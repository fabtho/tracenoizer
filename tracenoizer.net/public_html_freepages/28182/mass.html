 I remember as yesterday the police searching along the road with torches. My father had smashed everything except their wedding photograph in its large, old-fashioned curved glass frame. It was 10 or 14 miles in any direction to the nearest Catholic Church so we did not go to Mass very often. My father born in London was both an Anglican and a practicing Mason. About that time a very old Irish Catholic lady, who drove a horse and sulkey, came to our shop and went off without one of her parcels.</td>

 I was surprised, thinking that only Catholics had cornered the market on being rude to parents of young children. After the birth of my daughter, now three, church attendance was pretty sporadic. Naps, feedings, and so forth often didn't fit well into the schedule for weekend Mass. When you're a nursing mother, there is no discreet way or place to feed an infant when you're sitting in church. After a while, things fell into place and we began to attend more regularly.</td>

 The perfect example of this precipitation is the Pacific Northwest. Wind blows from West to East, therefore, our wind blows moist air from the Pacific Ocean, which is forced up by the Cascade Mountains. Frontal precipitation is caused when a warm air mass (front) or a cold air mass (front) meet each other causing one to uplift and go over the other. Because cold air is usually denser than warm air it tends to move under the warm air mass. A cold front meeting a warm front usually is intense than when a warm front advances on a cold front.</td>
