 I would ask of you, do you live your life lightly or heavily. Most likely, you find that some of the time you live your life lightly. Other times there are issues that really get to you. The voice of the world tells you that life is a struggle. And no matter how you come up over one challenge and another, there will always be another obstacle on the horizon for you.</td>

 Even though you won't learn everything, what you do learn will be worth it. I must warn you they get real mad if you forget something you just learned. Actually, in the second line (even though they told me a thousand times) the word "Durham's" is missing an apostrophe. So they'll probably get really frustrated while reading this paper. Jane once set up a pulley system where you could lift a friend or be lifted.</td>
