 The reputable and time honored PIMS database at Princeton University clearly demonstrates that businesses rated high by their customers for service grow faster and are more profitable than businesses rated low. The American Customer Satisfaction Index (University of Michigan Business School) stood at 74 in 1994, dipped to 71 in 1997 and has only slowly recovered to 73 in 2000. Only one in three customers who have a problem and contact the organization for help are satisfied with the response they get. Bold promises are often made - bad results are often the reality. The real issue is that the promised and necessary great services are harder to deliver than ever.</td>

 . The Integrated Global Ocean Services System (IGOSS) is the international SYSTEM for the collection and exchange of ocean data (such as temperature and salinity) and the preparation and dissemination of oceanic products and services. IGOSS is coordinated jointly by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), and consists of national facilities and services provided by participating member countries who share data for mutual benefit. In the IOS, naval ships, research vessels, and merchant ships in the Ships-of-Opportunity Programme (SOOP) along with fixed and floating buoys transmit oceanographic data such as subsurface temperature and salinity in near-real time. The IDPSS consists of several types of national, specialized and world data centres for processing and dissemination data and data products.</td>
