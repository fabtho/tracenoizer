 My mother and my grandmother both wore braclets for many years. My mother visited the wall last year and found her man and left her braclet after all these years. My grandmothers man was not ther we would like to find him or his family and give them the braclet and let them know we cared and still do. Thank you very much for your time I'm sorry I don't have any more information. We lost touch and I would very much like to find him.</td>

 And I give thanks to God and all of our peers in the music industry who've made this possible," said an elated Oscar De La Rosa from New York City. The current single, Te Deseo lo Mejor, from the aforementioned Grammy award-winning album has begun charting in several major Texas markets. Los Dos Gilbertos, Annette Y Axxion and Los Pekadorez, is ready to introduce the newest of the Discos MM family. Discos MM, along with FonoVisa - Tejano, is both pleased and proud to introduce The YoYo's to Tejano music. This conjunto consists of some familiar faces as well as some newcomers, but all are talented and ready to take Texas by storm.</td>

 I have shoulder length brown hair, blue eyes, and I'm 4'11. Looking for a boy to talk to and perhaps become my boyfriend. I also enjoy visiting my friends and family back home in California. My favourite bands are limp bizkit, Blink 182, and KoRn. Would like male or female penpals from all over the world.</td>
