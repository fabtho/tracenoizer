 . This really has made a difference to my life, allowing me to keep all my paperwork and records in great order and being able to find all details immediately. I have been using the bulk mail and email for promotion for the first time and along with the survey and comment results have had a fantastic response and being in regular contact with my customers really seems to have increased repeat and new referral business. DJ Solutions has made my life much easier and your tech support is great too. I no longer have to jump from one program to the next to keep track of all of my financial records and contracts and follow-up forms etc.</td>
