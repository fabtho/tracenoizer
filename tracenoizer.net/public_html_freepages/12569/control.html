 steel industry believes that better sensors in the primary steelmaking process can save energy and improve its competitiveness. Working with the American Iron and Steel Institute and the Department of Energy's Office of Industrial Technology, Sandia has developed an in-situ optical sensor that measures gas temperature and CO and CO2 absorption line intensities through the furnace off-gas during steelmaking. Such instruments will be invaluable for controlling and optimizing post-combustion and foaming slag practices, addressing industry needs for improved energy efficiency and emissions control, and developing automated process controls. Sarah Allendorf and Dave Ottesen working in the Industrial Sensors Laboratory and at three steelmaking facilities (Bethlehem Steel Sparrows Point, Weirton Steel, and Timken) have found good correlations with endpoint carbon and temperature at the basic oxygen facilities (BOF). Early tests at Timken's electric-arc furnace show promise for post-combustion control and off-gas temperature optimization.</td>

On the one hand, there is a need for permitting autonomy in order to support desirable system properties such as decentralised control. On the other hand, there is a need for restricting autonomy in order to reduce undesirable system properties such as unpredictability. The methodologies range from extensions of existing object oriented methodologies to new agent oriented techniques, which.</td>
