" Hi, i was just thinking about if it would be possible to switch kernels without haveing to restart the entire system. It sort of goes along with the hot-swap-everything ideas. I was thinking something like - Take all the structs related to userspace memory and processes - Save them to a reserved area of memory - Halt the kernel, mostly - Wipe kernel-space memory clean to avoid confusion - Load new kernel into memory - Replace all saved structures - Start kernel running agin This seems like the easiest way to do it. The biggest problem is that there would be somewhere about 30 seconds where all processes would be frozen. Anyways, I think this could be a nice feature of the kernel in situations where zero downtime is required.</td>

 The two new classes of compounds broaden the rich coordination chemistry of the triazasulfites by the introduction of a hard carbon centre. . Up to date industrial application of methyllithium is limited because it is only soluble in diethyl ether, amplifying various hazards in large scale processes. However, most reactions require polar solvents like diethyl ether or THF to dis-assemble parent organo lithium oligomers. In this paper we present two different approaches to tune methyllithium aggregation.</td>
