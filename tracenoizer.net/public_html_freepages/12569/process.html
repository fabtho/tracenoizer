 The goal of our University is to Advanced Knowledge for Humanity. With image processing technology, the procedure for quality control can be done automatically. The production process will then be less tiresome for the human workers. For developing the TIP image processing system, Parsytec, Inc. is used which has in the basic configuration 3 transputers.</td>
