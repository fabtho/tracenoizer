 . steel industry believes that better sensors in the primary steelmaking process can save energy and improve its competitiveness. Working with the American Iron and Steel Institute and the Department of Energy's Office of Industrial Technology, Sandia has developed an in-situ optical sensor that measures gas temperature and CO and CO2 absorption line intensities through the furnace off-gas during steelmaking. Such instruments will be invaluable for controlling and optimizing post-combustion and foaming slag practices, addressing industry needs for improved energy efficiency and emissions control, and developing automated process controls. Sarah Allendorf and Dave Ottesen working in the Industrial Sensors Laboratory and at three steelmaking facilities (Bethlehem Steel Sparrows Point, Weirton Steel, and Timken) have found good correlations with endpoint carbon and temperature at the basic oxygen facilities (BOF).</td>

 And for all the claims by certain worthy, grey-haired captains of industry that the New Economy is dead (or at least dying), the outlines are emerging of a fundamental change in the way we work and do business. The demands being made on employees and bosses alike are changing. In the transformation from the industrial to the knowledge society, more and more people are turning their backs on well-trodden paths. Heike Arnold first had the novel idea of a virtual company when she first heard about e-mail and the Internet in 1995. Time and again Ms Arnold, who has three children, had tried to reconcile her job with her family, for example by launching a home-based word-processing office for medical texts.</td>
