 . The trend is to disseminate responsibility of managing web content for the web site to the people who generate it rather then webmaster. In this situation the web master can focus on larger system issues and avoid dealing with small updates or additions. At the same time, this scenario creates a situation in which people who are uncomfortable with working on web design are forced to complete tasks for a web site. In addition, many organizations support multiple sites such as WAP, Flash, and HTML sites that have the same content.</td>

gz file because it screws up the line ending characters in the . gz file before sending it to the subprocess for decoding. This is because call-process-region writes the region to a temp file and then sends the temp file to the subprocess, but doesn't set any coding system on the temp file. If there are bytes that look like line ending characters near the front of the file (which is likely), the code that guesses about line endings will get it wrong and screw things up. This patch sets the coding system for the temp file to be the same as the coding system for the buffer containing the region (if it would otherwise be unknown) which fixes this problem.</td>
