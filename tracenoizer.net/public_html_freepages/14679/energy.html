 Proceedings of the Thirty-second Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences Copyright (c) 1998 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc. . Failing to fulfill energy delivery obligation may result in penalty to energy suppliers. This paper studies the relationship between generation level schedule, energy delivery schedule and physical ramp-rate of a generating unit. It is shown that although ramp-rate constraints are satisfied in traditional unit commitment problems, taking a generation level schedule as an energy delivery schedule may not be realizable.</td>
