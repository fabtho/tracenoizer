<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" Glen Sather went to two familiar wells to replenish his team in the days and hours before Tuesday's trade deadline -- one he unabashedly still admires and another that he long decried. The former is the Edmonton pipeline he built and maintained for a quarter-century (the one he has tapped to restaff almost his entire coaching, scouting and front-office departments). Just before the deadline, Sather struck a deal with protege Kevin Lowe to acquire potential-laden defenseman Tom Poti and versatile forward Rem Murray at the steep cost of heart-and-soul forward Mike York. The latter is the Madison Square Garden cash stream that has long fooled Rangers GMs into thinking they could buy their way out of winning droughts. Sather used that -- and some nifty poker playing -- to launch Pavel Bure (and a second-round 2002 draft pick) out of Florida for Igor Ulanov, Filip Novak, first- and second-rounders in 2002 and a fourth-rounder in 2003.">
