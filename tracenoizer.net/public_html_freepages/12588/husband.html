 Her writing has been published in numerous magazines and anthologies, including Whispers from Heaven and Listening to the Animals. Barbara Campbell was born and raised in the southern United States. She and her husband John moved with their six children to Australia in 1975. When the grandchildren started arriving, Barbara began storytelling. Now with 11 grandchildren and most of the family living in and around Brisbane, she finds time to put the stories to paper.</td>

She came to her present place of residence in 1853. 67 South to 438 West (State road curves to the right) 438 West goes southwest to 750 South, then west to next turn, cemetery is west of and back a short distance from the road.</td>

 The names Presly, Peter, Ursula, are all handed down in the Cockerill family. There are many records abstracted, and perhaps I overlooked it. There are supposed to be deeds or a deed between John Cockerell and a husband of his supposed Presley sistier-in-law, but I don't know if these deeds prove the relationship or not. 123 states that Elizabeth Presley Cockerill died (April-May) 1719, and Peter Presley Jr. 19, 1718) doesn't name her, only his two sisters Mary and Ursula.</td>
