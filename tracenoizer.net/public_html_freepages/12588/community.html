 Josh Riggle, a fifth-grader at Northwest Elementary School, was helping his teacher carry supplies to another room when he found out from the school principal that his story had been chosen for the stage. The Chicago company visited Huntington County schools last fall, putting on short performances and explaining what they were looking for in new stories. Three schools elected to participate, said Margaret Roush, director of the community fine arts program at the Merillat Centre for the Arts. Newsome learned of her selection at the same time as the rest of the school. To reserve tickets, call the Huntington College box office at 359-4261.</td>

 Lackey was born in Butler county, Ohio, in 1821, and has always followed the farmers occupation. He has been a resident for some years of Monroe township, where he is universally respected, and as a citizen occupies a conspicuous place in the estimation of his friends and neighbors. Lackey is a highly esteemed lady in the community in which she resides, and her life has been fraught with kind words and good deeds. She has indeed been a helpmate, and in the later years of her life many are the friends that rise up and call her blessed. Lackey has lived in Monroe township continuously since 1841.</td>
