 There was my great grandma and great grandpa, Sam and Hortense Blankenship. They had come to Indian Territory by way of Texas from their homes in Missouri. Both were teenagers who had lived through the ravages of the Civil War in their border state and then got in on the last of the Comanche raids in Texas. They had reared seven children of their own (and four others) in Indian Territory and watched it become the great state of Oklahoma in 1907. Now, their toiling ended, they rested with their children and a grandbaby.</td>
