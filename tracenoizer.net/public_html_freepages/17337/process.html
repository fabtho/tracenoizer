 I like that spinning Icon thing that's on the main page. I was in the Reserves for 25 years and was looking for some information for my daughter when I ran across your page. I am in the process of putting together a web page and was wondering how to do it. After looking at many pages I thought I would give asking you. You can also follow the link here and view picture's from renaissance faires all over the country.</td>

 Use tools and technology to identify and solve problems (work with a variety of technologies, problem solving). Visualize complex relationships among tasks to accomplish a different set of tasks (see things in mind's eye, knowing how to learn). Articulate suggestions for process improvements (improves and designs systems). Introduction, development and summary are well organized. Reader rarely spots errors in grammar and spelling.</td>

Besides, if he'd have cocked up at Sheffield, he wouldnt have been in a position to try again at a guess. and yes Margaret, you are right about the Nynex or Whatever, being 'in the process of' when we started. But, whenever these buildings are planned, they are planned to take ANY type of entertainment be it sporting or otherwise (hence the term Multipurpose venue) as amatter of course. Mr Biggar did a bloody good job here and has obviously carried on the good work over that side of the hills.</td>
