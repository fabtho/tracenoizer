 For those who may not know, Anschutz is the press-shy Denver billionaire who owns the Los Angeles Kings hockey team, the new Staples Center arena in L. Qwest is the long-distance company that last year swallowed U S West to become one of the largest phone companies in the country. Could be a blueprint for what Anschutz is doing these days in the movie-theater business. In 2000, when just about no one was looking, the 60-year-old bought up the all-but-worthless bonds of United Artist Theatres, converting them into a majority stake in the country's fourth-largest theater chain. Now he is said to be negotiating to do the same thing with the debt of Regal Cinemas, the nation's largest chain, with some 4,100 screens.</td>
