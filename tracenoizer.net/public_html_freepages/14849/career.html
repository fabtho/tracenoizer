 About the Lemelson-MIT High School Invention Apprenticeship Administered by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), The Lemelson-MIT High School Invention Apprenticeship is an experiential award given annually to one American high school student (9th-12th grades) for remarkable inventiveness. The Apprenticeship is designed to provide hands-on experience in a scientific and technological environment. Depending upon career interests, the winning student is paired with a leading scientist, technologist, engineer or entrepreneur -- anywhere in the country -- who serves as "Invention Mentor. " The student spends up to three weeks with his or her Invention Mentor, in order to learn more about the process of inventing first-hand. Last year, Krysta Morlan, a senior attending Vacaville High School in California, received the inaugural Lemelson-MIT High School Invention Apprenticeship.</td>
