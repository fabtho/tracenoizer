 Free access is usually provided within 24 hours of registration. . ESD System Studies are interdisciplinary exercises for teaching engineering systems. They combine traditional "case study" methods with technical models and data sets to teach students how to analyze and develop solutions for complex engineering systems. The System Studies have all been validated in courses.</td>

 The revised system has proven to be capable of sustaining continuous improvement and case is used here to derive architectural design models of a Software Process Engineering system. One is a system model that is independent of implementation and identifies the main elements of a Software Process Engineering system. With the help of this model, those responsible for process improvement in their organizations can design, evaluate, and revise complete Software Process Engineering systems. The other model is a design of a multi-site Software Process Engineering organization, and identifies not only the operative part of the organization but also the key non-operative elements that a Software Process Engineering system needs to work with. With the help of this model a multi-site organization can set up the operative Software Process Engineering organization and plan for strategies for managing the cooperation with the interfacing entities up front, rather than ending up managing such contacts on a reactive fashion.</td>
