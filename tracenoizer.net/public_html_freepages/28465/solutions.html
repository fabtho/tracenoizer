 Approximate within each short range (maybe squeezing an inequality into an equation). Combine the results from the short ranges, for example by proving that not all short ranges can reduce in the same way. If different cases have different numbers of solutions, ask what it takes for a case to have more than R different solutions, and get a bound for how many cases can have at least R solutions. Can you average over one of the variables instead of working things out for individual values. When averaging a sum of error terms, it sometimes helps to put in extra positive terms so your average will extend over all integers in the range, not just over a subset of them.</td>
