<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" They will interpret past events and issues within the context in which an event unfolded rather than solely in terms of present day norms and values. Students will understand the meaning, implications and impact of historical events while recognizing that events could have taken other directions. Research, writing and presentation skills are stressed. There are introductory studies of geography; of the origin and evolution of democracy; and of the modern world problems. Students will use a variety of maps and documents to understand causes and effects of human movement including migration, war, diffusion of ideas and technology, settlement patterns and trade.">

 Projects are indexed on an ongoing basis, using the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) thesaurus of the National Library of Medicine. . However, accessing information on research in progress is more difficult. The National Research Register (NRR) is a register of ongoing and recently completed research projects funded by, or of interest to, the United Kingdom's National Health Service. Information is held on over 80,000 research projects and is expected to grow further, as well as entries from the Medical Research Council's Clinical Trials Register, and details on reviews in progress collected by the NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination.</td>

SOCIAL The social and behavioural research projects provide an advanced understanding of society and human behaviour as it impacts on transmission of the hepatitis C virus. EPIDEMIOLOGICAL AND CLINICAL The epidemiological and clinical projects centre on the distribution and determinants of disease in human populations. Furthermore, they enable us to gain a greater understanding of the causation and natural history of disease and to develop and evaluate strategies in the prevention, diagnosis, and management of disease.</td>
