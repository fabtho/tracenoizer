 Laurel, MD 20707 ABSTRACT The biomedical digital library of the future is expected to provide access to stores of biomedical database information containing text and images. Developing efficient methods for accessing such databases is a research effort at the Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications of the National Library of Medicine. WebMIRS is implemented as a Java applet that allows database access to text and to associated image data, without requiring any user software beyond a standard Web browser. The applet implementation allows WebMIRS to run on any hardware platform (such as PCs, the Macintosh, or Unix machines) which supports a Java-enabled Web browser, such as Netscape or Internet Explorer. INTRODUCTION We approach the problem of providing wide-area network access to multimedia biomedical databases from the engineering perspective of exploiting technology for making important health-related data sets readily available to researchers and to the general public on a national scale.</td>
