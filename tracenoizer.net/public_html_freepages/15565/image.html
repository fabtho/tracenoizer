 We anticipate the largest compression to occur on multi-page documents in which the relative overhead is reduced. . Text Image Compression Text Image Compression Abstract A system is being developed for the Symbolic COmpression of Document Images (SCODI). The primary objective of the system is to provide an encoded version of either a single or multi-page text intensive document image. A secondary objective is to provide an encoding which allows near random access of regions within the image and facilitates traditional document processing operations such as skew detection, segmentation, block classification, and keyword searching to be performed without requiring a complete decoding of the image.</td>

 This work was supported in part by the IBM Corporation, in part by the Digital Equipment Corporation, and in part by the Corporation for National Research Initiatives, using funds from the Advanced Research Projects Agency of the United States Department of Defense under grant MDA972-92-J1029. . Abstract Text-image maps are a valuable tool for coordinating the full text and page images of documents in electronic libraries. In different situations, either the text or the image is a more convenient representation -- and text-image maps make it easy to change between representations as the situation dictates. Though the Web is arguably the most ubiquitous new information distribution in use by the Internet community, it does not provide enough functionality to exploit text-image maps fully.</td>
