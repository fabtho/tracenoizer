Charlie married Madge in August 1949, they have had 52 happy years together. Charlie left the shipyard for good in 1956 to go to the half complete East Yelland Power Station where he was seconded to Parsons to assist with the completion of the remaining turbines. In 1960 he transferred to the training school which had been set up in 1957 by Tom Godfrey who was at that time the sole instructor. Charlie enjoyed his work at the school immensely, feeling (justifiably) that he had helped many young men to a good start in their working lives.">

 This full-service boatyard and marina is one of the few that still move boats on marina railways. Edwards uses four separate railways, with the help of a forklift, hydraulic trailer, and launch ramp. Transient slips, a fuel dock and pumpout station, and a portable toilet dump station are available. A major part of Edwards' income is from the repair business and winter storage of 180 boats. Yard services-including fiberglass hull repair, restoration of wood boats, and Awlgrip painting-are specialties at Edwards.</td>
