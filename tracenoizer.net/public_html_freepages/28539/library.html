 Copyright research You are in National Portrait Gallery . Copyright research Copyright research We have an ongoing programme of copyright research, in collaboration with a variety of other organisations. This is to ensure that the rights information on works in our Primary and Reference collections, maintained on our copyright database in the Picture Library, is accurate and up-to-date. Despite our efforts to trace information on artists and photographers, or their descendents and legatees, the copyright status and ownership of certain works in our collection is still unclear. We would welcome any information which you believe might be helpful in this respect.</td>
