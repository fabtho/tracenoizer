 Access to the files can be accomplished either by mounting (or sharing) the data directories from a local file server, or copying the files to your own computer. (In the future, the software will automatically search for data first on your own computer, then on a local archive, and then on one of the primary archives. ) In either case, you must define the environment variable HSI_DATA_ARCHIVE to point to the location of the data (see below). The HESSI software uses a file database to locate the data times you request. fits file contains a cross-reference between time intervals and file names containing those time intervals.</td>
