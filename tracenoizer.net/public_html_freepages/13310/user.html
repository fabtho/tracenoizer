 Like access control, though, they are not usually designed for virus detection. . Therefore, the potential exists for viruses on multi-user systems. As a result, it is prudent to ensure that the security measures taken on a multi-user system address viruses as well. Currently, administrators of multi-user systems have a limited number of options for virus protection.</td>

 . I run PGP at home on my own PC, and unless someone breaks into my house or monitors my electromagnetic emissions, they probably can't see my plaintext files or secret keys. On multi-user systems, there are much greater risks of your plaintext or keys or passwords being exposed. The Unix system administrator or a clever intruder can read your plaintext files, or perhaps even use special software to covertly monitor your keystrokes or read what's on your screen. On a Unix system, any other user can read your environment information remotely by simply using the Unix ps command.</td>
