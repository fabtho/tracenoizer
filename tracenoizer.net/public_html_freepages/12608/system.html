 This release is recommended for all production systems. We hope to have either a BOF session or a workshop as part of a larger conference within the next 6-12 months. This system is not meant to replace the need for powerful internet-wide search systems like Lycos, Infoseek, Webcrawler and AltaVista. Instead it is meant to cover the search needs for a single company, campus, or even a particular sub section of a web site. The type of these different web servers doesn't matter as long as they understand the HTTP 1.</td>

 . It facilitates the maintenance of a large site by abstracting out common 'boilerplate' segments of code, e. header and footer segments that are similar system-wide. A number of varying styles and macros can also be supported. Central to our operations is 'ht', which takes a simplified HTML file and adds 'boilerplate' stuff such as banner ads and navigation menus.</td>
