 This system is not meant to replace the need for powerful internet-wide search systems like Lycos, Infoseek, Webcrawler and AltaVista. Instead it is meant to cover the search needs for a single company, campus, or even a particular sub section of a web site. The type of these different web servers doesn't matter as long as they understand the HTTP 1. For example, the online documentation search above uses the same database as the campus main search. The difference between the searches is that the documentation search will only show results related to the online documentation.</td>

 Some firewalls (rightly) block these requests, so if the browser goes silent just interrupt the transfer request with the stop button. If you're running an IRC client you may find the disclosure stops when you turn it off; see instructions below. People often type their email or postal address into forms, when registering at a site or requesting information. It's usually a string of random-looking letters long enough to be unique. If you look at your cookies file you may see the names of web sites that you have never heard of.</td>
