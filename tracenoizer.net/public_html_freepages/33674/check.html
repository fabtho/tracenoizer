 Greenpeace offers this easy guide to known nuclear weapons, drawn from publicly available sources, but this site is believed to be unique in providing one global map with the exact coordinates of all known nuclear weapons facilities and storage sites. Please keep comments on topic, or leave rants about US policy on your own blog. Check out their video clip which I'm pretty proud of, cos the star is my Grandmother who passed away last year. Their video is still in the top 5 on the NZM videos chart. I'd love for Nesian Mystik to grab a stack of awards, those boys are great.</td>

 It's normally about an hour drive but we've had the trip take 3 on a Friday evening, so we don't want to take chances. If we get there early, we'll just kill time at the nearby Potomac Mills. Last time we were there, the Sanrio store had all sorts of rare stuff (including Shinkansen) from other countries, so I'd like to go there and check out the Deery Lou selection. At any rate, it will be fun seeing them again, and getting out to dinner. .</td>
