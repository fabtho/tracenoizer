 Everyone wants the best for their children and to protect them from danger. Why would anyone knowingly allow their children to be exposed to toxic pesticides when effective alternatives already exist. Rachel Carson Council's mission is devoted to fostering a sense of wonder and respect toward nature and to helping society realize Rachel Carson's vision of a healthy and diverse environment. Please remember that migrating birds need insects to eat to survive and raise their young. Among her legacies is the view from Rachel's window.</td>
