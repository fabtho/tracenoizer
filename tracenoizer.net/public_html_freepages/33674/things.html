 Where's the call to repentance and humility and the call to walk without compromise. The reason is that we are more concerned about making someone feel good than we are about making someone good (redeemed). I don't not believe, I just need to be shown things before I believe. If they want to go to their church on Sundays and send their kids along to Sunday School that's fine by me, but don't ram it down my throat. " I'm still trying to process these fragmented conversations, and what God is saying through all of them.</td>

 It seems like Woodbridge is the home of the chain restaurant however, and the traffic was so bad we didn't dare venture into DC. Of course, we were just happy we got a chance to see Shannon and Jon while they were here. I wish we lived closer together, it's hard finding another couple to do things with that we both like. We both ended up picking up stuff even though they are going back to do the bulk of their shopping today and we have our own Ikea we're at all the time. On our way down to meet them, we saw a new Ikea being built near College Park.</td>
