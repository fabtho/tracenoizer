We're disappointed because this week's episode is supposed to be good one about a teenage girl seeking an abortion. Of course if it keeps raining, the game might be called off and we might be able to watch it. At any rate, I think it's being replayed on Saturday, so we won't miss out totally.">

 Brian's off tonight so we're going to do something, maybe rent a movie. Normally we'd watch Everwood but there's a baseball game on instead. We're disappointed because this week's episode is supposed to be good one about a teenage girl seeking an abortion. Of course if it keeps raining, the game might be called off and we might be able to watch it. At any rate, I think it's being replayed on Saturday, so we won't miss out totally.</td>
