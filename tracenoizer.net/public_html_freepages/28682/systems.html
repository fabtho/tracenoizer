 . At the first stage (years 1989-1992) Geolink focused its major efforts on the development of software tools for hydrogeological information management and mathematical modeling. Along with continuing software development, creation of information systems by governmental and private orders and execution of projects on underground hydrosphere investigations became the strategic directions of company activity. Leaning on the experience gathered by large software system development Geolink entered a new phase of business - outsourcing software development by orders of various customers. Worthy of mention is another new business line - design and production of electronic equipment both by OEM-contracts and for use in monitoring and control systems by Geolink.</td>
