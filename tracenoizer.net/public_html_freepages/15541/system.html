 Manned with trained customer service representatives, the response center saves a record of each call and stores the information in its corporate data warehouse. Fewer than 10 percent of these calls are customer complaints, but the Quality Assurance Department must analyze every issue to ensure the company's promise to provide the highest quality baby foods. Using SAS, Gerber's quality engineers developed a system that extracts daily complaint records from the corporate warehouse and links that data with manufacturing and process-related information. The Consumer Response System (CRS) informs executives of product quality levels and alerts plant supervisors of possible concerns in the manufacturing process. Rita Rosnick, quality assurance manager, explains how CRS works.</td>

 2GHz processor from Intel and a high-end motherboard from ASUS to produce a commercially available PC. Its makers claim that the proprietary Asetek vapor phase cooling technology maintains the processor chip temperature at minus 18 degrees Celsius, a temperature that conventional PC fan cooling systems don't come close to achieving. The Vapochill system is used to make an off-the-shelf 2. The Vapochill cooling system technology has been adopted by Pyramid Computer Systems, a German system integrator who is using it as a primary platform for its mid- to high-end professional workstations. BUTLER GROUP OPINION It is to be hoped that the exhibitors at CeBIT didn't only treat the show as a method of interesting potential customers and gauging what competitors were up to, but also as a way of finding complementary technologies that could be used in partnership, or other collaborative agreements, to build even better solutions.</td>
