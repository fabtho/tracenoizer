It provides support for alias analysis, dependency analysis, modeling machine latencies, and modeling resource requirements. It also supports top-down and bottom-up instruction scheduling, as well as adding instructions to scheduled blocks. A research compiler requires many man-years of effort to build, and a production compiler may be orders of magnitude larger. So compiler work that can be reused in other projects is a benefit.</td>
