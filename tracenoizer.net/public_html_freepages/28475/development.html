 National Report - Students and learning - Part 2 8. 22 Over the last 20 years, the higher education sector has undertaken a wide range of experimentation in developing and implementing new technology for learning and teaching. This has been triggered by a succession of publicly funded development programmes, and in the last decade has been underpinned by the network of discipline-based Computers in Teaching Initiative (CTI) centres, now numbering 24, all sited in universities. Looking ahead, we see a growing contribution to learning from the extensive use of computer-assisted learning materials, communications technology and new, enhanced delivery systems. 24 One of the benefits of new technology lies in providing a learning environment that may succeed in improving understanding where other methods have failed.</td>
