<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" NOVASIL QUARZ is waterbased and contains a siloxane resin, which makes it water-repellent, without reducing in any way the permeability rate of the substrate. Apply the second coat after at least 12 hours from the first one. Stain effects, patinas or transparent glazes may be achieved with Antiche Patine mixed with Fase Silossanica, transparent siloxane base applied over NOVASIL QUARZ with any tool depending on local tradition, at least 12 hours after the application of the siloxane paint. NOVASIL QUARZ dries out completely within 12 hours, but this figure may vary depending on weather conditions.

 The proprietor was asked to run a mailing list for a local business newspaper, then asked to train on the software and it all went on from there. In 1986 a sister company CHURCH MICROS was formed offering the supply of hardware and peripherals to GRAYSWOOD customers. CHURCH MICROS has flourished and now maintains its own customer base. Servicing London and the South-East of England, we have expanded - with our original customers and gained many more en route - offering a personal and professional service. Between the two companies we are able to advise, install, train and support PC based systems.</td>
