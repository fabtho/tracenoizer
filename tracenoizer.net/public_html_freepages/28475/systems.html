 22 Over the last 20 years, the higher education sector has undertaken a wide range of experimentation in developing and implementing new technology for learning and teaching. This has been triggered by a succession of publicly funded development programmes, and in the last decade has been underpinned by the network of discipline-based Computers in Teaching Initiative (CTI) centres, now numbering 24, all sited in universities. Looking ahead, we see a growing contribution to learning from the extensive use of computer-assisted learning materials, communications technology and new, enhanced delivery systems. 24 One of the benefits of new technology lies in providing a learning environment that may succeed in improving understanding where other methods have failed. 25 Computers can provide access to information and learning materials through the World Wide Web, datastores, electronic journals and other sources.</td>
