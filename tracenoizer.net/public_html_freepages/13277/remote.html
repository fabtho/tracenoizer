 Just ask for the videos from Captain of My Ship or Skip Atwater, or ask for the videos by name. . Secrets of Training Military Remote Viewing Skills Military Training Remote Viewing Skills In 1977, I became the Operations and Training Officer for the newly formed U. It was my responsibility to develop and implement a comprehensive military remote-viewing training plan. To develop background material, I read about different remote-viewing programs at various organizations such as Stanford Research Institute, the Psychophysical Research Laboratory, and The University of Houston.</td>

 . In particular, the treatment of different image data sets in multiple combinations with optimum degree of geometric accuracy is required for the exact geographic location of individual ground features, especially in mountainous regions. Moreover, multisensor remote sensing data have to be made available to be used in geographic information systems or environmental monitoring systems. Hence, based on many years of research in the field of remote sensing, the Institute for Digital Image Processing of JOANNEUM RESEARCH has developed RSG - the Remote Sensing software package Graz. The RSG software package is designed as comprehensive and versatile as possible for geometric processing and quality assessment of digital multisensor remote sensing data.</td>
