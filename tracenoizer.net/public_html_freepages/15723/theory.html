 Student in Instructional Systems Technology I came from China. I am a second year doctoral student in Instructional Systems Technology Department. This is a prestigious program, with a great variety of focuses a doctoral student can choose for his or her professional development, from soft technology - the theory - to hardware technology application. My personal interests lie in systems thinking, affective learning, and how hardware technology can facilitate learning (especially in online learning environment).

 . Infinite Dimensional Stochastic Analysis Infinite Dimensional Stochastic Analysis (includes Malliavin Calculus, Dirichlet Forms) November 3-7, 1997 Video for this conference is available in our Video Archive. There are challenging connections between this calculus and other areas of stochastic analysis such as diffusions on manifolds, anticipating stochastic calculus and quantum field theory. The theory of Dirichlet forms provides analytic tools to construct and to study a large class of Markov processes with irregular or large state spaces like fractals or infinite-dimensional manifolds. The purpose of this workshop is to review the current state of knowledge in these areas, to identify important directions for future research, and to provide a forum for cross-fertilization of ideas between the two areas.</td>
