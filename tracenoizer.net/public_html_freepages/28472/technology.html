 Woonona High School principal Clive Arthur, the Wollongong district representative of the NSW Secondary Principals' Council, said he welcomed the introduction of e-learning accounts. TAFE An increasing array of online courses at TAFE colleges across Australia mean students will no longer be limited to the courses offered by their local TAFE. Illawarra Institute of Technology director Ray Tolhurst said TAFE NSW already offered a variety of online courses, while many more were in the pipeline. And it offers flexibility and diversity to both students and teachers. '' Mr Tolhurst said the Illawarra institute had been instrumental in developing, and piloting, a number of innovative online courses.</td>

 The phrase sends shivers down the spines of cash-strapped college students everywhere. The increase seems meager when UA students consider the scope of needs facing the university. From professors' salaries and teaching assistant (TA) salaries to improvements in advising and information technology, a tuition increase could have a direct impact on the quality of education UA students receive. Arizona students should not object to an increase that could have substantial benefits. While each area needs attention, Likins' plan to pay for UA's construction debt is problematic.</td>
