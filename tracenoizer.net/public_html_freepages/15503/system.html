 Our solutions also comprise log rotation, continuous security updates and administration training. Intrusion attempts are reported and tracked, and in most cases we can also offer analysis of possible errors for the hardware, which means that the hardware can be upgraded before any serious errors occur. The surveillance system reports all events to the system administrators or, if you like, to Cendio Systems. In order to establish reliable messaging, when the network capacity is limited, the system can be completed with a GSM card which sends SMS messages when serious errors occur. .</td>

 Today we are the only commercial enterprise capable of end-to-end integration of entire imaging payloads. Then we design and build the focal plane electronics, fabricate and test the precision optics, and build the structure that holds the camera together. In this way, we can make your system better, faster, and more cost efficient. Throughout our history, Kodak has continually pioneered electronic imaging. Our CCD Image Sensors are used widely in industry and consumer markets, and in 1997 reliably guided NASA's Mars rover about the red planet.</td>
