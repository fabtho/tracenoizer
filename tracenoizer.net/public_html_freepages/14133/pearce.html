 These converted bedrooms as classrooms are still there but looking a little more civilised than this. A fourth form class, at a guess, but from well before my time. What I do know is that Christian Pearce on the right of the back row has positioned himself so that you can't see that one of his legs is completely in plaster. This is the same fourth form class that feature in the first picture in Gallery One. In a moment the photographer is going to head round to the right and take their photo from the front - like in the preceding photo.</td>

 . Showbiz VERVE WYZIN YOU UP Project Wyze looks promising As I grow increasingly disillusioned with the state of hip-hop music, I find myself ever more willing to sample new musical flavours. By Christian Pearce Recently, I opened my ears and mind to the exploding rock-rap genre, mixed together in this case by Ontario's own Project Wyze. for the first time early last summer, I've been pulling PW's CD out of my shrinking pile of regulars on, well, a regular basis. reflects the diversity of the group's influences, which include everything from Black Sabbath to Swollen Members.</td>
