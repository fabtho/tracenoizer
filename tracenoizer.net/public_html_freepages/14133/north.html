 To mark International Women's Day, we have joined together to support their call. We urge the Government to give its backing to the Jubilee 2000 campaign for the cancellation of the unpayable debts of the poorest countries to benefit the poorest people in the South. Arms sold by the North create debt, while social unrest caused by the debt crisis can escalate into war. Famine and displacement of communities are also consequences of the debt crisis. The Northern governments which gave loans to governments in the South which they knew to be undemocratic and repressive must accept their responsibility for this situation.</td>
