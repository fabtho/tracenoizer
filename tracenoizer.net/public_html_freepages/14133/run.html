 Famine and displacement of communities are also consequences of the debt crisis. The Northern governments which gave loans to governments in the South which they knew to be undemocratic and repressive must accept their responsibility for this situation. The effects of the debt burden run all through the poorer sectors and communities, making a mockery of the right to education and a decent standard of living enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. When debt repayments and structural adjustment packages demand reduction in government social spending and employment, it is women who have to cope with the problem of finding the means to feed their families. When the cost of healthcare rises it is women who have to care for the sick at home, as well as having to forego proper antenatal care themselves.</td>

 Do let me know about any problems compiling it though. Anyone interested in the latest fixes and features is free to play. update which is run before the rest of the config is parsed, so that file updates can be separated from the rest of the configuration. 2 and encoutered some problems with the SetCommentStart and SetCommentEnd directives in the editfiles section. --------------------------------------------------------------------- .</td>

 If you missed it or would like to see it again come to Weymouth Pavilion, 2-6 October 1999. They may be unhappy, worried, have behavioural problems and feel abandoned. Having someone to talk to during this difficult time can make all the difference - and this is where Relateen, run by the charity, Dorset Relate, can help. They provide one-to-one counselling of young people between 11 and 18 who are involved in a family breakdown, either now or in the past. They offer a responsive sounding board at a time when young people may feel that noone else is really listening to them.</td>
