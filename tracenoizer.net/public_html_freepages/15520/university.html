 Carnegie Mellon Census Research Data Center The Bureau of the Census of the U. Department of Commerce (DOC) has long sought a mechanism by which it could make detailed Census information more readily available to researchers, as well as connect Census data to other important national datasets, such as those housed at the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Justice, while maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of that data. With this in mind, the DOC recently granted Carnegie Mellon University's H. John Heinz III School of Public Policy and Management the only Census Center to be housed at a university. By revolutionizing access to detailed data, the Center is poised to attract nationally renowned scholars to the school to engage in inter-disciplinary, collaborative research on important policy issues.</td>
