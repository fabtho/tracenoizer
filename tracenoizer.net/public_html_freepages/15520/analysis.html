 Our research has led to novel self-tuning components being included in Microsoft SQL Server. Developing rich modes of information access from data stores is the other central focus of our group. Traditional approaches to data reduction and analysis break down with massive data sets. Therefore, we aim at exploiting data mining techniques, i. , applying statistical and machine learning techniques to detect patterns in databases.</td>

 Participating faculty represent nearly every college of the University. The Center is based on the recognition that many different kinds of systems which include self-regulation, feedback or adaptation in their dynamics, may have a common underlying structure despite their apparent differences. Moreover, these deep structural similarities can be exploited to transfer methods of analysis and understanding from one field to another. In addition to developing deeper understandings of specific systems, interdisciplinary approaches should help elucidate the general structure and behavior of complex systems, and move us toward a deeper appreciation of the general nature of such systems. If you find something on those old pages that you can't find on the new pages, but which you think should be on the new pages, please contact us.</td>

 You can also use ODBC to import data from a variety of other data base sources. . Not even the most subtle and skilled analysis can overcome completely the unreliability of basic data. Data management is the foundation of every good data analysis. You need to consider issues like how your data is entered, documented, and stored.</td>
