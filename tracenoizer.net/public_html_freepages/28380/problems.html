 " Before the computer checkout system, students would walk around the room until they found a computer, sometimes hovering over people until they were finished. "The old system was you just walk around until you find one, and then pounce -- it's like in a parking structure," McDermott said. The self-regulating lines free up time for the student navigation assistants so they can help students with computer problems rather than spending all their time checking out computers. "We have a lot of job duties, and eliminating checking out computers made it a little faster. " Some students said they dislike the new system and the reasoning behind the switch.</td>
