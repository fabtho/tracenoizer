 . This gives you a new freedom from your desktop, which is enhanced by a robust, long range Radio Frequency design for cordless operation. This sensor represents the first fundamentally new design in low cost gyroscope technology, worldwide, in over sixty years. This unique design uses electromagnetics to drive and sense a vibrating beam, allowing for a very high performance with a low manufacturing cost. Gyration owns broad patents on this approach, thus creating significant barriers to potential competitors in this low cost, high performance consumer sensor market.</td>
