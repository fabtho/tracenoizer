 Gunn suggested that every profession is related to the World Wide Web in some way. Technology can't be escaped, she said, and "every single person is a piece of the puzzle in technology. " For those who suffer from fear at the thought of having to use a computer, Gunn cited research that, fortunately, indicates that computer anxiety is not a predictor of one's ability to use a computer. In spite of the large numbers of technophobes in the United States--40 percent of people are intimated by technology--more people than ever are online. As of November 1999, for the first time, Gunn said, more adult Americans use the Internet than do not.</td>
