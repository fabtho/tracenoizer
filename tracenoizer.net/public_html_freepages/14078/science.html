<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" GrADS is a multidisciplinary group of computational and computer scientists who are exploring the scientific and technical problems that must be solved to enable the routine development and performance tuning of Grid applications. I also participate in several collaborations undertaken through the DOE Accelerated Strategic Computing Initiative. I am a member of the science steering committee of the DOE Center for Simulation of Advanced Rockets (CSAR). CSAR is a multidisciplinary group of computational and computer scientists who are developing a fully integrated simulation of solid rocket burns, targeting the space shuttle solid rocket booster. Related to my role at CSAR is my membership within the corresponding DOE center at Caltech, the Center for Simulating Dynamic Response of Materials.">
