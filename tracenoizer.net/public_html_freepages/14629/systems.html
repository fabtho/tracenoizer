 . Relevant work experience and a bachelor's degree are prerequisites for many jobs; for more complex jobs, a graduate degree is preferred. These workers-computer systems analysts, computer scientists, and database administrators-include a wide range of computer specialists. Job tasks and occupational titles used to describe these workers evolve rapidly, reflecting new areas of specialization or changes in technology, as well as the preferences and practices of employers. Systems analysts solve computer problems and enable computer technology to meet individual needs of an organization.</td>
