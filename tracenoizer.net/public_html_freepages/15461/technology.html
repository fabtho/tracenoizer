 How can we treat wastewater in sparsely populated areas. These are just some of the questions that have come up in the Environmental Cluster Research Programme. The range of topics covered by the programme is one of the most far-reaching of any of the Tekes technology programmes. In practice it extends from the earth to the skies and to the waters, too. .</td>

 Department of Energy's initiative to clean up hazardous waste, responding to remediation problems that need faster, safer, better or cheaper technological solutions. You'll find information here about those technologies, the scientists behind them, and our efforts to move these technologies into the marketplace. And because environmental issues affect everyone, not just scientists, we provide lay-level descriptions for many of our technology projects. Enjoy your Internet surfing but please bear with us as some information is still under construction. .</td>
