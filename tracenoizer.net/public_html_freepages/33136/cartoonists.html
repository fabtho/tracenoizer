 In 1997, he won first-place honors for editorial cartooning in the Best of Gannett Awards. In 1999, he was announced the winner of the Fischetti Award. The annual award, named in honor of the late Pulitzer Prize-winning editorial cartoonist John Fischetti, honors individuals whose work is judged to be representative of the best being done by professional editorial cartoonists in North America. Anderson grew up in Toledo, Ohio, in a family that he says was apolitical. At age 15, he started drawing cartoons for his high school newspaper and immediately knew his calling.</td>
