<meta name="Description" lang=" "content=" Turned himself into a great defender, and pried into the offensive weaknesses of the newly un-retired Michael Jordan in the 1995 playoffs. Nick was haunted by this occurrence, which had happened so quickly after being the hero of the Chicago series, but he didn't show it in 1995-96. Anderson played terribly after Shaq's departure in 1996-97, bothered by wrist problems, his terrible shooting, and a trumped up rape charge that left him crying at a press conference podium. It is my nature to believe the accuser in most crimes, but I immediately deemed Nick innocent after looking at him at that table, tears rolling down his cheeks not as a show of innocence, but as example of the frustration that had permeated the way he lived. Anderson started the year like he did no other, playing the worst basketball of his career.">
