 . The SPDS is was initiated in 1994 by NASA's former Space Physics Division to preserve historical data and provide improved access to space physics data. The SPDS is a distributed system whose services are existing data systems serving the disciplines of space physics, Cosmic and Heliospheric Physics Ionospheric, Thermospheric and Mesospheric Physics Magnetospheric Physics Solar Physics Multi-Disciplinary Services Other Related Services plus individuals from the science community who are interested in data related issues. The SPDS is still taking shape and will continue to evolve. Any comments or suggestions are welcome and should be directed to the SPDS project scientist, discipline coordinators, or project coordinator who form together the SPDS Coordination Working Group (directory of names and addresses).</td>

 SARSAT is part of an international cooperative effort dedicated to saving persons in distress on land or water. The Division administers the NOAA GOES Data Collection (DCS) and Argos (jointly with the French space agency) Data Collection and Locations Systems used by researchers, governmental and environmental organizations worldwide. The Division also provides operational information and support for the worldwide direct readout community who are given free, unrestricted access to scientific data directly from the NOAA-operated satellites. The links below can provide you further information on any of these activities. .</td>
