 It's her that made me build sound backgrounds in polymer, computer and biology areas. I love Tsinghua's free academic atmosphere, and miss the past time as well as my classmates. It is this period that stimulated my interests in science and technology. Then I made up my mind to pursue a higher education. In my life time, high school period is very short whereas very important.</td>
