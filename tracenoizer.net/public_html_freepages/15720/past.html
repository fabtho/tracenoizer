 Shanghai will give priority to improving its transportation system continuously, and plans to construct a highway system in suburban areas to connect with neighboring cities and provinces. . Zhang Huiming, director of the Shanghai Municipal Construction Commission, told Xinhua at the ongoing '99 Fortune Global Forum that Shanghai's transportation, housing and environmental protection have been greatly improved over the past few years. The total investment in these areas has reached 100 billion yuan for the past nine years, he said. Shanghai, with a total population of 13 million, has already completed construction of about 4,000 kilometers of new urban roads.</td>

 After finding my love in Singapore, we went back to China, our motherland. I was extremely happy because I felt lonely no longer. I found that China really took a great change during the past one year. However, China's natural environment changed from bad to worse, and reform also created more jobless than ever. Anyhow, I believe and sincerely wish our motherland can overcome these temporary difficulties as soon as possible.</td>

They have made a comeback in the past five years on the contemporary Chinese cultural scene. After General Zhou Yu died, Zhuge Liang went to Zhou's shrine to pay his respect. Zhou's soldiers wanted to kill Zhuge because he was responsible for Zhou's death.</td>
