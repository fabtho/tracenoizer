 Artist's Statement As an artist I am powerfully drawn to close up objects in nature, as well as the space that surrounds the object. I enjoy taking something out of its reality and placing it along surrounded by light or shadow. I believe that within the stillness I may encounter the object's vibration, or shimmer of energy. And when I am successful I am able to capture some of its truth in a painting. In the landscape I see the same relationship but on a larger scale.</td>
