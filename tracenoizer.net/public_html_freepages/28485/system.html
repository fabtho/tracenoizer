Pryor's Development System - Mind and Memory - Fabulous Visual Images Beyond the Doors The mind processes visual imagery on both conscious and subconscious levels. The eyes take in so much detail that the subconscious mind must filter it before encoding for memory. In the process of forming a memory, each mind spontaneously draws upon the subconscious or fabulous mental legacy of its cultural past to interact with new detail and produce unique resonances of meaning.">

 ciaopp can perform a number of program debugging, analysis and source-to-source transformation tasks on (CIAO) Prolog programs. Certain kinds of static debugging, finding errors before running the program. This includes checking the ways in which programs call the system library predicates and also checking the assertions present in the program or in other modules used by the program. Such assertions essentially represent partial specifications of the program. Several kinds of source to source program transformations such as program specialization, program parallelization (including granularity control), inclusion of run-time tests for assertions which cannot be checked completely at compile-time, etc.</td>
