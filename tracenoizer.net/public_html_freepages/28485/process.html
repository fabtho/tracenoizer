 Depending on what the specific desired use is, quite often a property owner must submit an application(s) for review by the County. In order to assist land owners and others who are interested or involved in these processes, the Planning and Zoning Department has prepared user guides. These guides will explain application requirements and the typical review processes involved for rezoning and subdividing property, for special uses, as well as for specific reviews under the County's Exemption from Platting process. These process guides are available here online and also in PDF format. The Planning and Zoning Department hopes that you will find these guides both useful and informative for your specific situation.</td>
