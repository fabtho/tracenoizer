 The lighting of the whole piece suggest some arcane ritual, and the combination of alchemy and technology is a fitting metaphor for the process of bronze casting. . ARTVOICE ArtShorts by Steve Mitchell This Saturday, a major multi-disciplinary gallery exhibition of digital video and interactive digital art opens at the Carnegie. The show is a coup for guest curator Ghen Zando-Dennis and testament to her perseverance, as all of the artists consistently produce challenging work particularly relevant to our troubled times. Shot on the New York subway system, Kennedy captures candid images of her subjects as they traverse the city wrapped in their own thoughts and oblivious to her intrusion.</td>

 . Harun Farocki's challenging documentaries take an unorthodox look at European life By Steven A. via Godmilow's short "What Farocki Taught" than for the four documentaries just released on video by Facets. The latter is meant to bear out the former's provocative contention that the 17th-century Dutch still life, by turning from religious subjects to fetishizing quotidian objects, paved the way for modern consumerism. Unfortunately, the lecture feels stiff and uncinematic, and the documentary material rambling.</td>

 to support and comment the '100 days' lectures series. Every evening there is a big lecture, organized by Catherine David. The participants of WorkSpace will have access to the guests (if she or he wants this) and their textes, video and audio recordings. But we will not become an alternative press conference space. If the atmosphere becomes too formal or if it get too busy, then we can close the space.</td>
