 The benchmarks that follow are aimed at getting students to understand human social behavior, not at fostering social action or socializing future citizens. In everyday life, scientific knowledge is seldom essential or sufficient for guiding social action. Nevertheless, if scientific knowledge of how human society works is widely shared, it can contribute to better personal and public decision making. Exploring the findings of social science requires teachers and students to be both the observers and the observed. It takes time for students to learn how to shift roles.</td>
