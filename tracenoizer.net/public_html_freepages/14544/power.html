 Bill Joy and Ray Kurzweil, two individuals who I respect for both their insight and their contributions to our industry, are leading a debate on an issue that should arouse interest in all of us. The discussion revolves around whether continued progress in computer, robotic, and genomic technology will eventually make humankind disappear or at least become superfluous. The first hazard is the near-term ability to create pathogenic organisms as increasing computer power makes genomic research possible in literally every college laboratory. By giving this power to everyone, we will also be giving it to crazy people and the extremists. " His second concern is the field of nanotechnology, where matter is manipulated at an atomic level.</td>

 We cannot go forward if we do not know whence we have come, and whence we have come is what we learn in this erudite history. Postman He suggests that a true democracy can use its technical skills not to control but to enhance human endeavor and preserve freedom and individuality. It is only by acknowledging this tradition and its power can we hope to change it. the decline of a print-based epistemology and the accompanying rise of a television-based epistemology has had grave consequences for public life, that we are getting sillier by the minute. .</td>
