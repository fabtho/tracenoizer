 Theodore Kaczynski developed a negative attitude toward the techno-industrial system very early in his life. It wasn't until 1971 or 72, shortly after I moved to Montana, that I read Jaques Ellul's book, The Technological Societv. I thought, 'look, this guy is saying things I have been wanting to say all along. It reduces people to gears in a machine, it takes away our autonomy and our freedom. Along with the rage he felt against the machine, his words revealed an obvious love for a very special place in the wilds of Montana.</td>

 An ideology is a system of false consciousness in which you no longer function as the subject in your relation to the world. "The various forms of ideology are all structured around different abstractions, yet they all serve the interests of a dominant (or aspiring dominant) class by giving you a sense of purpose in you sacrifice, suffering and submission. "In accepting ideologies we accept an inversion of subject and object; things take on a human power and will, while human beings have their place as things. The restriction of knowledge to an elite group destroys the spirit of society and leads to its intellectual impoverishment. This ever-present and necessary threat of official violence in society helps keep the system operating, making ordinary business contracts enforceable, reducing crime, providing machinery for the peaceful settlement of disputes.</td>
