 Teachers may select from these provincially recommended learning resources or may use other locally approved resources. Information about recommended learning resources is found in each Appendix B of the Integrated Resource Packages, organized in the format of a Grade Collection. As new resources are recommended through the provincial evaluation process, they are added to the Grade Collections. ..</td>

 Departments will continue to surplus laptops and non Intel based systems when appropriate. . This process, based on the Computer Workstation Acquisition and Upgrade Plan, enables participating departments to increase their purchasing power for computers by pooling funds with other departments to allow mass purchases of computers by the Microcomputer Maintenance Shop. Examples of classes of computers, their use, and their acquisition cost are shown in Table I. The class of a computer is based on the applications that a faculty or staff member intends to use.</td>
