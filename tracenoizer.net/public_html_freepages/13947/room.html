 Unfortunately it's in a random place every time you start the game, so I can't tell you where it is. Turn off all the thrusters, turn on the electricity, and carry the White Robot through the sewer maze. When you enter the room that the Black Crystal is in, the White Robot's radio will start broadcasting. Check every nook and cranny of the room, and you'll eventually find the Black Crystal. (You can tell where it is because when you walk over it, the crystal will partially obscure your cursor.</td>

The hostel had a very friendly atmosphere with lots of travellers moving to or from Sydney. We discovered the RSL (Returned Services League) club, which offered cheap food and drink, and let in any foreign visitor.</td>

Back to Top Oregon Bach Festival Sunday, May 13, 7 p. Don't miss this stunning performance of Beethoven's Missa Solemnis and Piano Concerto No.</td>
