An example of the distribution of NCI fiscal resources is found in Figures 11 and 11a, which display budget allocations by funding mechanism for FY 1997. The approved grant applications are ranked in percentile or priority score order from most meritorious to least. Generally, program directors select grants for payment in straight priority or percentile score order. However, they may skip one or more applications that already receive support from other sources or for programmatic reasons and use the saved monies to fund applications with a poorer priority or percentile score that may be important to the program's objectives.">

 But users can _create_ POSIX directories within MPE accounts and you will need to monitor this. I found that if you follow the installation instructions, it goes by the book and isn't much more involved than any other update. The difference is how much new stuff there is to to learn in order to stay on top of the system _after_ the update. Use the time until the upgrade to get the free space on ldev 1 that you must have. I have created the AXLDEV1 file (see the upgrade manual) in advance so I don't have to bother about enough disc-space.</td>
