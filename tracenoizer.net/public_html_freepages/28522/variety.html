 The computer-scored assessment contains 116-question multiple-choice questions designed to detect and diagnose unique behavioral competencies proven critical to management success. The instrument has been validated in multiple research studies and has been used in Fortune 100 companies for both hiring and management development. Student scores were compared with those of 196 front-line and mid-level managers from a variety of US industries who completed the same questionnaire. FindingsFigure 1 (below) graphs student and manager scores for each of 19 competencies. The two least differentiated competencies are both intellectual in nature.</td>

However, as we have previously pointed out, INCLL captures non commutativity at the level of hypotheses rather than connectives. Additionally neither of these systems directly admits the concept of a mobile hypothesis (although the latter system may be able to capture it by not constraining a hypothesis at all in the order variety) As a . To fully explore uses of an order aware logic in computer science, we would like it to conservatively extend both traditional and linear logic.
