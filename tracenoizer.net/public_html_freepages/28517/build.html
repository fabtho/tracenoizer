<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" Fellowship of Overseas Christian University Students (FOCUS) meets regularly at the University of New South Wales (UNSW), Sydney Australia, and it is part of the St. FOCUS started 17 years ago when a small group of overseas and Australian students gathered together to study the Bible. We meet on Fridays and Sundays to study God's Word in large meetings and smaller groups, to have fellowship together as a church, and to build each other up in the hope we all share. We will be looking at the idea of Jesus' Resurrection from the dead, where does it fit into God's plan, and how does that impact us. This year will be on Monday 22 July to Friday 26 July at Merroo Conference Centre.">

 Inviting the editor of the local newspaper to tour the campus (statement I) shows confidence in the school staff and the success of the changes they have implemented and communicates that confidence to the editor. The principal has the responsibility to define what is expected in order to accomplish the school's mission and to communicate this mission publicly. A direct response to the newspaper, such as a well-written guest editorial (statement IV), is an appropriate way for the principal to articulate that mission in a public forum and build support for the school in the larger community. Urging other staff to respond to the editorial (statement III) could communicate an unwillingness on the part of the principal to do so herself. Option B, which includes statements I and IV, is the correct response.</td>
