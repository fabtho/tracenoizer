 . The new CD-ROM will be released Sunday, October 18 in Japan. As part of promoting this concept, PFU delivered its ultrahigh-definition Kokuho Butsuzo (National Treasure Buddhist Images) image browsing system last March. Each image stored in this system is 630MB with a resolution of 16,800 x 13,200 pixels. PFU followed up the browsing system by announcing and releasing the Kokuho Butsuzo series CD-ROM titles last May, which has been well-received for its high quality.</td>

Templates were developed by clustering textual symbols from a training set. Symbols from new document images were compared to the templates to find the best script.</td>
