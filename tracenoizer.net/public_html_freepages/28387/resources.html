 To these ends, QUT will create a fair and rewarding learning work environment for its students and staff. It will provide flexible programs and professional services which are responsive to the needs of students, employers and other clients. It will be a pre-eminent institution in the application of modern technology to academic and management functions and will be a responsible manager of public resources. The University will work with its internal and external communities to achieve these objectives through implementation of a quality system. Each faculty and division is responsible for developing its quality system in the context of QUT's mission and quality policy, for specifying the requirements of its communities (internal and external), designing its products, services and procedures in the light of these requirements and allocating its resources and facilities so that these requirements are met.</td>

 Two-way programs typically share the goals of bilingual proficiency, academic achievement, and positive cross-cultural attitudes and behaviors, but they vary a good deal in the approaches and strategies they use to work toward those goals. A host of local factors affect such issues as student enrollment, program features and design, and instructional features. Emerging results of studies of two-way bilingual programs point to their effectiveness in educating nonnative-English-speaking students, their promise of expanding our nation's language resources by conserving the native language skills of minority students and developing second language skills in English-speaking students, and their hope of improving relationships between majority and minority groups by enhancing cross-cultural understanding and appreciation. INTRODUCTION The best setting for educating linguistic minority pupils--and one of the best for educating any pupil--is a school in which two languages are used without apology and where becoming proficient in both is considered a significant intellectual and cultural achievement. Glenn, Principal, 1990 In a growing number of schools in the United States, students are learning through two languages in programs that aim to develop dual language proficiency along with academic achievement.</td>
