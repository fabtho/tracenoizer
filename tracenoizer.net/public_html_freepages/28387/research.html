<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" Several programs that began in the 1960s and 1970s (for example, the Coral Way Bilingual Elementary School in Miami) continue this type of instruction through the present. Since the mid 1980s, however, the two-way approach has attracted renewed interest, and many new programs have been established. This interest was likely the result of a convergence of factors, including increased attention to foreign language learning for English speakers, research on effective programs for educating language minority students, and the availability of federal and state funding for programs using this approach. A goal of the study, and of this report, is to assist current and prospective programs with their planning by giving them a picture of what other programs are doing.

 A second survey (PDF), soliciting general input through three open-ended questions, was sent to all other employees. These surveys were developed in an effort to gather the broadest possible input from the members of our community and to make sure that the task force's recommendations are consistent with what the community needs. While the information elicited from the surveys is important, it is not as important as the community-wide discussion that the task force hopes this research will prompt. Thus, all university employees are invited to participate in a discussion session (html, PDF) to talk about the survey findings. President Merten and members of the Quality of Work Life Task Force will attend each discussion session.</td>
