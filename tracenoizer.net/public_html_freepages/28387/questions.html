Two-way programs share many features but vary in significant ways as well, and these areas of variability in implementation will be a focus of this report. There are also a number of unanswered questions about how to handle certain issues; concerns that were voiced by schools during the course of the study will be raised in the next section. Finally, following some concluding remarks, an appendix will list other sources of information about two-way bilingual education, from research reports to videotapes produced by individual schools.

 This group of fourteen faculty and staff - including the chairs of the Staff and Faculty Senates and faculty specializing in organizational psychology - has met regularly for almost a year. While much of that time has been spent reviewing the university's current policies, members of the task force also developed and analyzed two surveys that were distributed to all university employees in April 2000. A second survey (PDF), soliciting general input through three open-ended questions, was sent to all other employees. These surveys were developed in an effort to gather the broadest possible input from the members of our community and to make sure that the task force's recommendations are consistent with what the community needs. While the information elicited from the surveys is important, it is not as important as the community-wide discussion that the task force hopes this research will prompt.</td>
