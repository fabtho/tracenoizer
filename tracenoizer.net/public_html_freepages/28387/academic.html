<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" These two-way bilingual programs integrate language minority and language majority students and provide content area instruction and language development in two languages. A study of over 160 schools between 1991 and 1994 provides a picture of the current state of two-way bilingual education in the United States. Two-way programs typically share the goals of bilingual proficiency, academic achievement, and positive cross-cultural attitudes and behaviors, but they vary a good deal in the approaches and strategies they use to work toward those goals. A host of local factors affect such issues as student enrollment, program features and design, and instructional features. Emerging results of studies of two-way bilingual programs point to their effectiveness in educating nonnative-English-speaking students, their promise of expanding our nation's language resources by conserving the native language skills of minority students and developing second language skills in English-speaking students, and their hope of improving relationships between majority and minority groups by enhancing cross-cultural understanding and appreciation.">

 (2) For eighth grade students whose first language is not English, the students' native language serves as a foundation for English language acquisition. (2) For students whose first language is other than English, the native language serves as the foundation for English language acquisition. Cognitive skills transfer from one language to another, and students literate in their first language will apply these skills and other academic proficiencies to the second language. In some instances, second language learners undergo silent periods of varying durations when they first begin to learn a new language. Students often understand more than they can produce and may repeat words in sentences that they do not entirely understand.</td>

 To these ends, QUT will create a fair and rewarding learning work environment for its students and staff. It will provide flexible programs and professional services which are responsive to the needs of students, employers and other clients. It will be a pre-eminent institution in the application of modern technology to academic and management functions and will be a responsible manager of public resources. The University will work with its internal and external communities to achieve these objectives through implementation of a quality system. Each faculty and division is responsible for developing its quality system in the context of QUT's mission and quality policy, for specifying the requirements of its communities (internal and external), designing its products, services and procedures in the light of these requirements and allocating its resources and facilities so that these requirements are met.</td>
