<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" While much of that time has been spent reviewing the university's current policies, members of the task force also developed and analyzed two surveys that were distributed to all university employees in April 2000. A second survey (PDF), soliciting general input through three open-ended questions, was sent to all other employees. These surveys were developed in an effort to gather the broadest possible input from the members of our community and to make sure that the task force's recommendations are consistent with what the community needs. While the information elicited from the surveys is important, it is not as important as the community-wide discussion that the task force hopes this research will prompt. Thus, all university employees are invited to participate in a discussion session (html, PDF) to talk about the survey findings.">
