 We are always adding material about the music and culture of the Ewe and other African ethnic groups, along with related graphics, sound, and videos that you can download. . African Music and Dance Ensemble Home Page African Music And Dance Ensemble CK Ladzekpo, Director History of the Ensemble The founding and development of The African Music and Dance Ensemble is closely associated with the development of the Pan-African consciousness of African-Americans in the United States. The Ensemble in fact emerged from a tradition of African music and dance activities set by CK Ladzekpo from Ghana, West Africa through his scholarly research, teaching and performances. At university and high school campuses in California to Great Britain's Black Dance Development Trust's special summer schools for Black Dance Professionals in Europe, the Ensemble has taught the skill, artistry and philosophy that inform the African music and dance traditions.</td>
