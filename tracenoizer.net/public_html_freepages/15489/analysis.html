 You should try us because perhaps you have not been completely satisfied with the quality of the results you have received from other TEM service labs. We are also expert at preparing and examining temperature sensitive materials, exotic materials or materials that other labs find it difficult to prepare. Why shouldn't I use one analysis firm that does several techniques like SIMS, Auger, TEM, etc. Because TEM is our only business, our quality is superb, so you get the results you need the first time. .</td>
