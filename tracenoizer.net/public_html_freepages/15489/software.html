 .com Brings Remote Management Online December 4, 2000 By Cornell W. Robinson III What if a network manager could distribute software, monitor the servers on his or her network and stay on track with the helpdesk -- all with one software platform. To make things even more interesting, what if the software platform wasn't installed on a local server. PatchLink calls its E-Management Services an MSP (management service provider) package.</td>
