 The mammoth flying boat, created by Howard Hughes, achieved fame in its one-and-only flight on November, 2 1947. The Evergreen Museum won the right to display the historic aircraft in 1992 after the Disney Corporation terminated the lease on the Long Beach, California building where it had been on display since 1982. With an effort befitting the size of the worlds largest airplane, the HK-1 was disassembled and moved north. Plans for the Oregon museum were put on hold when its founder, Michael King Smith, was killed in a 1995 auto accident. After regrouping, the museum has moved steadily forward, raising funding and receiving most of the legal approvals needed to begin the construction.</td>

 They chuckled, boylike, because they would be late for bed; and it was all mother Wendy's fault. When their voices died away there came cold silence over the lagoon, and then a feeble cry. With a last effort Peter pulled her up the rock and then lay down beside her. Even as he also fainted he saw that the water was rising. He knew that they would soon be drowned, but he could do no more.</td>

 For downtown businesses and property owners, Centro San Antonio stimulates business development. It will strengthen downtown's economic base and help ensure healthy, vibrant property uses and associated property value. Through this focused effort, private property owners will continue to work together to make downtown a more attractive address to live, work, shop and visit. In addition to this web site, newsletters are published on a quarterly basis and distributed to property owners, tenants, and numerous businesses in and surrounding the District. As a part of that plan, the Centro San Antonio seeks many opportunities to promote the activities and services provided by the Public Improvement District.</td>
