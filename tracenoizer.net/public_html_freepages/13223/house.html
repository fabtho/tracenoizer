com Bush creates homeland defense agency In an address to Congress and the nation Thursday night, President Bush announced the creation of a new Cabinet-level Office of Homeland Security. Bush noted that currently, several different federal agencies have responsibility for aspects of homeland defense, and said Ridge would work to manage their efforts. Despite his Cabinet-level status, the director of the Office of Homeland Security will not need Senate confirmation and his office will be based within the White House, White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said Friday. Fleischer said the new office will be established by executive order and compared it to the Office of Faith-Based Initiatives. Tom Ridge, who will head the new office, will serve as an assistant to the President, not as an agency chief.</td>
