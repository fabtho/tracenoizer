 POLICY West Africa Nigeria Liberia East and Central Africa Burundi The Democratic Republic of Congo (Formerly Zaire) Ethiopia Kenya Rwanda Sudan Uganda Southern Africa Angola Mozambique Zambia South Africa INTRODUCTION The Clinton administration deserves commendation for its recent efforts to develop a fresh approach toward Africa. The continent is finally receiving high-level attention from the U. government, including a recent trip by Secretary of State Albright in December 1997 and a historic visit from President Clinton scheduled for the end of March. The emphasis of the administration's new Africa policy is on trade and security. But neither stability nor economic development can be sustained in the face of new rounds of repression of civil society and political opposition and massacres of civilians, with their attendant refugee flows and humanitarian disaster.</td>
