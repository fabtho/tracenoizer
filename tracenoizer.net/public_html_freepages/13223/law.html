 Clinton Administration Counter Terrorism Initiative Clinton Administration Counter Terrorism Initiative I. Actions Already Announced by the President (1) Pass the Omnibus Counter-Terrorism Act of 1995 This bill would provide clear Federal criminal jurisdiction for any international terrorist attack that might occur in the United States; provide Federal criminal jurisdiction over terrorists who use the United States as the place from which to plan terrorist attacks overseas; provide a workable mechanism, utilizing United States District Judges appointed by the Chief Justice, to deport expeditiously alien terrorists without risking the disclosure of national security information or techniques; provide a new mechanism for preventing fundraising in the United States that supports international terrorist activities overseas; and would implement an international treaty requiring the insertion of a chemical agent into plastic explosives when manufactured to make them detectable. (2) Provide more tools to federal law enforcement agencies fighting terrorism Amend the Fair Credit Reporting Act to Ease access to financial and credit reports in anti-terrorism cases. This legislation provides for disclosures by consumer reporting agencies to the FBI for counterintelligence and counterterrorism purposes. The FBI has no mechanism for obtaining credit reports for lead purposes in counterterrorism cases.</td>

 The Framework was the result of 15 months of work by an interagency task force headed up by White House policy advisor Ira Magaziner. The taxation of commerce conducted over the Internet should be consistent with the established principles of international taxation, should avoid inconsistent national tax jurisdictions and double taxation, and should be simple to administer and easy to understand. Still, the Framework itself is non-binding; in many cases, changes to federal law will be needed to implement the policies called for in the report. The report outlines the challenges faced by tax officials in a world where buyers and sellers can be anonymous, where transactions take place in cyberspace, and where both money and products exist as flurries of electronic bits. The report helped calm some Internet companies and entrepreneurs who were fearful that President Clinton might seek to impose new or redundant taxes on the Internet.</td>

 The Bill Clintongate Administration FORMER President Clinton. The most corrupt administration in the history of this nation is now over. Even out of office, the FORMER president can't seem to abide by the law. Even his departure from office was a disgrace leaving us with three new scandals. Many have inquired as to the future of this page now that Clinton has left office.</td>
