 Authentication relates to evidence that the identity of an entity is genuine, that procedure arguments are legitimate, that types are properly matched when strong typing is to be invoked, etc. Crude all-or-nothing authorizations are typically inadequate. In applications for which user-group-world authorizations are inadequate, access-control lists and role-based authorizations may be preferable. Finer-grained access controls may be desirable in some cases, such as capability-based addressing and field-based database protection. Serious security and privacy issues must be addressed.</td>

 Up to 16 base units may be daisy-chained using standard RJ45 cables to provide multi-loop solutions, up to 128 loops. The system is designed to be used with any device running a Modbus RTU or Profibus DP master communications interface or operating as an OPC client. DIN rail mounting allows the 2500 to be mounted where the control action is required, minimizing the cost of wiring, since only twisted pair communications cable is taken to the user interface. The 2500 may also be mounted directly onto the machine, saving the cost of control cubicles. IOS 2500 uses iTOOLS, a Windows-based software tool.</td>
