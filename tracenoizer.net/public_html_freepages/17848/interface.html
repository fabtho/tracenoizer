When you initialize a combo box with an array or a vector, the combo box creates a default model object for you. As with other Swing components, you can customize a combo box in part by implementing a custom model -- an object that implements the ComboBoxModel interface. The JComboBox methods that change the items in the combo box's menu, such as insertItemAt, work only if the data model implements the MutableComboBoxModel interface (a subinterface of ComboBoxModel).

 . Up to 16 base units may be daisy-chained using standard RJ45 cables to provide multi-loop solutions, up to 128 loops. The system is designed to be used with any device running a Modbus RTU or Profibus DP master communications interface or operating as an OPC client. DIN rail mounting allows the 2500 to be mounted where the control action is required, minimizing the cost of wiring, since only twisted pair communications cable is taken to the user interface. The 2500 may also be mounted directly onto the machine, saving the cost of control cubicles.</td>

 You can, in fact, create a struct on the stack without using new, but be careful. If you don't use new, you must initialize all the values in the struct by hand before you use it (before you pass it to a method) or it won't compile. This data hiding promotes encapsulation and allows you to change your implementation of the class without breaking the interface your clients rely on. To the client, a property looks like a member variable, but to the implementor of the class it looks like a method. This arrangement is perfect; it allows you total encapsulation and data hiding while giving your clients easy access to the members.</td>

 The value of a well-thought-out architecture is considerable in open-source systems. The value in closed-source proprietary systems could also be significant, if it were thought through early on, although architectural foresight is often impeded by legacy compatibility requirements that tend to lock into inflexible architectures. Good interface design is as fundamental to good architectures as is their structure. Both the architectural structure and the architectural interfaces (particularly the visible interfaces, but also some of the internal interfaces that must be interoperable) benefit from careful early specification. Trustworthiness is expensive to implement and to ensure, and as a consequence significant benefits can result from minimizing what has to be trustworthy.</td>
