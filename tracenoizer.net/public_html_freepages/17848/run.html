 The argument serves as a status code; by convention, a nonzero status code indicates abnormal termination. The virtual machine's shutdown sequence constists of two phases. In the first phase all registered shutdown hooks, if any, are started in some unspecified order and allowed to run concurrently until they finish. In the second phase all uninvoked finalizers are run if finalization-on-exit has been enabled. If this method is invoked after the virtual machine has begun its shutdown sequence then if shutdown hooks are being run this method will block indefinitely.</td>

 Late binding to methods and properties This allows the programmer to invoke properties and methods on objects dynamically instantiated based on type discovery. Creating types at runtime (Reflection Emit) The ultimate use of reflection is to create new types at runtime and then to use those types to perform tasks. You might do this when a custom class, created at runtime, will run significantly faster than more generic code created at compile time. You start by initializing an object of the type MemberInfo. Type encapsulates a representation of the type of an object.</td>
