 But like every operating system issue, the question of where and when to use this talented new-comer has become a debate of near religious zealotry in most camps. " question a number of times and have come to the same conclusions favored by most of those not caught on one side or the other of the Microsoft-Linux jihad. Namely, that Linux is great for niche serving applications (just as it has been for years), is making inroads as a stand-alone network-serving platform, but is still not really a viable option for general-purpose business desktop computing. So when the topic of testing Linux distributions cropped up, we had to decide on our focus very carefully. After some debate, we decided to check out only commercial Linux distributions and test them with an eye toward standard-network and Web-serving suitability.</td>
