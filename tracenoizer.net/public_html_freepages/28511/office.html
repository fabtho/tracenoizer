 The regulations address the rights and responsibilities of the members of the University community, including faculty, staff and students, and provide standards for sustaining this community. They do not repeat all of the definitions or terms found in the University Policies, nor do they repeat the many self-executing provisions of the University Policies. Members of the University community may propose amendments to these regulations by filing proposals with the Office of Student Life (OSL) for review and possible recommendation to the Chancellor. Property also includes computers and network systems owned, maintained or controlled by the University or funded by University budgets or designated by the campus as subject to these policies. For the purposes of this document, this definition includes students enrolled in programs such as Summer Bridge and those who have submitted an application, but whose admission has been deferred to the spring semester and who are enrolled in Extension programs.</td>
