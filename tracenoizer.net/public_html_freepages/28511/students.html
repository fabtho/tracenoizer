 After settling down in the East coast of Canada, Saint John New Brunswick, I received my BSc and MSc marine biology degrees from the University of New Brunswick. Mike Coates, Paul Scott, Paul Sammarco, and Terry Piva. Extracurricular activities include President of the Council of Postgraduate Students, Director of CQUSA, ballroom dancing, and scuba diving. With the opening of the Mackay CQU campus, I have been able to interview first year education students, as they will be the first to graduate here. I am enrolled full time, and have an interest in the completion and competencies of university students, including the structure of all support groups, such as student associations and mentoring.</td>

 . SORC Response to Recommendations from the Grievance Board History . This will be a meaningful exercise only if it has the strong support of the Senate, the University administration, and the Alma Mater Society and the Society of Graduate and Professional Students. All University decision-making officials, and in particular Associate Deans and Board of Studies Chairs should be apprised of the basic requirements of the principles of natural justice. SORC was asked to advise the Senate on how these recommendations should be addressed.</td>
