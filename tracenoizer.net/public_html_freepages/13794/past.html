"We must leave behind the constraints of the ABM Treaty that enshrined the past and that prevent us from defending against today's threats. soil is growing as a number of nations work to acquire increased capabilities.

 The showing of ID's was instituted during last year's swim season. The swim price increase was instituted in order to encourage people to join a group (TBN, HSWT or whoever), so the people who are fighting for your rights have more backing from people taking advantage of their efforts. org In the past, TBN has held it's membership meeting during the September swim. Starting this year, it will be held during the October swim. The membership meeting involves announcing who is on the current Board of Directors and openings for unfilled positions.</td>
