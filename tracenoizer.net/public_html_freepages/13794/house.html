 Bob's interests in young adulthood were football and baseball, fishing and hunting. Keith was born 27 September 1963 and Matt was born 23 November 1965. Bob's special memories were the first electricity on Fox Hollow Road, when he shot a 12-point buck with a rifle, building his house in 1966 and sailing out of the Golden Gate Bridge after World War II. Bob was in the Navy as a Seaman First Class, in the Second World War from 1944-1946 at the age of seventeen. .</td>
