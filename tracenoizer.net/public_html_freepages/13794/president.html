 Though living in New England, he is still a member of the Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia. .I remember my term as president as a time when I had an opportunity to get to know some Pioneers well, enjoy their reminiscences, and make some lasting friendships. I ended my term with a deep sense of gratitude to Susan Drake who, as vice-president solved many problems before anyone else was aware of them. Lew Klein, who has contributed so much to Pioneers over the years, was instrumental in "signing up" our Person of the Year," Dick Vermeil.</td>

 On behalf of all the grassroots supporters across New Hampshire, welcome to the Bob Smith for U. For the last 12 years, it has been a great honor to serve the people of New Hampshire in the United States Senate, putting my experience to work each day to make a difference for New Hampshire families. We all must join together with pride, behind the leadership of our President and our military in winning this campaign against terrorism. We have responded legislatively in the Senate to many of these important issues, passsing bills to make air travel safer, providing additional funding to fight terrorism and give relief to victims of this vicious attack on our nation. Last year, I had the honor of working with President Bush to lower taxes, get more dollars for New Hampshire classrooms, and reform Medicare.</td>
