<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" Riley today warned that massive budget cuts being proposed will undermine community efforts to make their schools safer next fall. Riley released state-by-state budget tables documenting sharply reduced federal funding levels that could have a significant impact on communities working to reduce violence and drug use in schools. "This retreat from federal support comes at a time when drug use among young people is rising and violence threatens the learning environment in many of the nation's schools," Riley said. "It's very disturbing and a clear signal that we must redouble our efforts. I cannot understand why anyone concerned with the future of this nation and the health and safety of our children would willingly retreat in such a critical fight.">

Most importantly, youth contests create a positive atmosphere in which young people and adults who share a love of the Morgan can interact. Friendships developed through youth contests are a rewarding and fulfilling benefit.</td>
