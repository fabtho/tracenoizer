 These schools should join or create a Rebuild America community partnership. To have a Rebuild America representative contact you, call 1-800-DOE-3732. They can become partners in Rebuild America and the EnergySmart Schools effort. As partners, they offer services and products ranging from workshops and publications to design and construction. In some cases, they provide school services such as building audits or review of energy finance contracts at no or low cost.</td>

 The mammoth flying boat, created by Howard Hughes, achieved fame in its one-and-only flight on November, 2 1947. The Evergreen Museum won the right to display the historic aircraft in 1992 after the Disney Corporation terminated the lease on the Long Beach, California building where it had been on display since 1982. With an effort befitting the size of the worlds largest airplane, the HK-1 was disassembled and moved north. Plans for the Oregon museum were put on hold when its founder, Michael King Smith, was killed in a 1995 auto accident. After regrouping, the museum has moved steadily forward, raising funding and receiving most of the legal approvals needed to begin the construction.</td>
