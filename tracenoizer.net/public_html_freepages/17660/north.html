 . Why is there no plan to link it to a M27 junction; how can they feed even more traffic into Eastleigh area. Why don't they link with Fareham and create a new link road running parallel with the motorway to help both Whitley and the Fareham North Plans.

 The mammoth flying boat, created by Howard Hughes, achieved fame in its one-and-only flight on November, 2 1947. The Evergreen Museum won the right to display the historic aircraft in 1992 after the Disney Corporation terminated the lease on the Long Beach, California building where it had been on display since 1982. With an effort befitting the size of the worlds largest airplane, the HK-1 was disassembled and moved north. Plans for the Oregon museum were put on hold when its founder, Michael King Smith, was killed in a 1995 auto accident. After regrouping, the museum has moved steadily forward, raising funding and receiving most of the legal approvals needed to begin the construction.</td>
