The Inner City Catholic Teacher Corps annually will send a dozen fresh SOE graduates to teach in Boston's Catholic schools, beginning in the summer of 1997.

A planning committee is working on site selection and recruitment, as well as the design of a professional development program that will lead to teacher re-certification for both the volunteers and participating teachers from the archdiocesan schools.">
