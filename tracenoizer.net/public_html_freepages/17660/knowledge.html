 Similarly, the AMHA believes that Morgan youths should also be versatile. Youth of the Year contests are designed to recognize top achievers. The written exam covers information concerning equipment, Morgan history, rules and regulations, basic horse care and general equine knowledge. Oral presentation topics are given to contestants a few weeks prior to the contest. Each participant is responsible for preparing a three to five-minute presentation on the given topic.</td>
