While this alone represents a significant asset, True North's Management has a broader vision for growing the Company into a leader in the discovery, production and value-added manufacturing of North American gemstone deposits. The Regal Ridge Emerald project is just one of several Canadian and international gem exploration and development projects being considered by True North.
