 Index Latest news New Interface to ADS Catalogue is in development, allowing for faster and more controlled searches. Online Access to the Index of Archaeological Investigations (OASIS) pilot study for use of electronic data submission tools begins this summer. The Archaeology Data Service (ADS) supports research, learning and teaching with high quality and dependable digital resources. It does this by preserving digital data in the long term, and by promoting and disseminating a broad range of data in archaeology. The ADS promotes good practice in the use of digital data in archaeology, it provides technical advice to the research community, and supports the deployment of digital technologies.</td>
