 Sample applications of the new simulator are discussed. 7kPDF 97-03A Simulation Tool for Analysis of Alternative Paradigms for the New Electricity BusinessThis paper provides preliminary results on the development of a simulation tool to perform analysis alternative paradigms. Since power systems are ultimately governed by the laws of physics, the heart of the tool is a power system simulation engine, valid over a simulated time frame of minutes to days. The modular structure of the tool then allows other packages to be superimposed on this structure to represent different proposed paradigms. 8kPDF 97-04Technical Challenges of Computing Available Transfer Capability (ATC) in Electric Power SystemsThis paper discusses the ATC definitions and determination guidelines approved by the North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) and presents several concepts for dealing with the technical challenges of computation.</td>

 Additionally, inexpensive real-time access to factory information from the desktop eliminated costly delays resulting from gathering, analyzing and transfering data. Normally requiring costly time-consuming development by programmers and MIS specialists, this approach of using OR specialists resulted in a complete implemented network and decision support system in less than one year. This marked a major shift from traditional shop floor systems deployment within Nortel and the industry in general and illustrates an opportunity for OR to assume a leadership role in systems implementation in manufacturing operations. The model development group has also been able to act as an internal consulting group, quickly incorporating new operating considerations.
