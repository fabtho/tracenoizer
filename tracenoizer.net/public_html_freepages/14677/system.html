 The Edelman award recognizes outstanding implemented work that has had a significant positive impact on the performance of the client organization. The work to be presented by this year's finalists covers a wide range of operations research applications. " Hewlett Packard planned to build a large automated manufacturing system for Ink Jet printers. Originally, it planned to use a flow line design with multiple subassembly cells of more than 100 processes separated by virtually no buffers. The resulting system throughput proved to be inadequate.</td>
