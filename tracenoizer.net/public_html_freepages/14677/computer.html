 Its main activities are in the field of discrete-event simulation; with a secondary interest in the simulation of continuous systems. Royal Institiute of Technology, Sweden The Simulation Laboratory at RIT conducts research and education in advanced simulation methodologies, techniques, and tools. Their focus is on thedevelopment of distributed simulation techniques as applied to computer and telecommunication systems. University of Arizona University of Arizona's Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, in Tucson, offers degree programs with a focus in simulation. University of Gent, Belgium The University of Gent, Department of Applied Mathematics, Biometrics and Process Control offers courses in simulation.</td>
