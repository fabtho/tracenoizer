 URBANITY expanded IO_dencies locates urbanity in a field generated by city inhabitants and by the city itself as an emancipated partner. Utopia is not the construction of a new city, utopia is the movement towards the potential of working together with the complexity of an existing big city in order to develop new forms of urban agencies. The Tokyo IO_dencies project combines physical, local urban dynamics of the selected city quarter of Shimbashi with virtual network flows (the activities of the participants in the net). SHIMBASHI-local urban profiles In Tokyo, the central Shimbashi area was analyzed in collaboration with local architects (Sota Ichikawa and others). Participants can collaboratively develop hypothetical urban dynamics.</td>
