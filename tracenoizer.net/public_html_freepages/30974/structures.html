 Technology is used in particular in order to make the ritualised social communication even more perfect, smooth and characterless or 'generic'. Digitisation is supposed to prevent any kind of social noise or economic disturbance. In Tokyo, the IO_Dencies project therefore develops software structures that could create a noisy, irritating network of events between the actors. The Tokyo IO_dencies project combines physical, local urban dynamics of the selected city quarter of Shimbashi with virtual network flows (the activities of the participants in the net). The movements towards 'an other city' will be generated by manipulating, operating and modifying the urban flows.</td>
