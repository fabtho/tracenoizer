 The software modules allow for the variation and transformation of data clusters by connective activities. IO_dencies proposes an experimental connection between the city and the electronic networks. The data networks enable the development of connected activities in which neither the city, nor the networks, nor the configuration of the machine can be the single determining factor for the unfolding of the events. Instead, each factor simultaneously contributes to and disturbs the impulses of the others. IO_dencies is an ongoing project, the first part of which was shown by Knowbotic Research at the ArtLab7 in Tokyo in October 1997.</td>
