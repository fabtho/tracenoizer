 IO_dencies is an ongoing project, the first part of which was shown by Knowbotic Research at the ArtLab7 in Tokyo in October 1997. The third intervention is planned for Moscow or Budapest. The choice of these cities is intended to confront different cultural environments which imply specific interrelations between traditional ways of building, economic and political conditions, and electronic communication structures. A close relation with the concrete city environment is maintained by working with local architects and urban researchers who deal with the problems and challenges of the local urban environment. Special thanks to Yukiko Shikata, Kaz Abe, Siegfried Zielinski.</td>
