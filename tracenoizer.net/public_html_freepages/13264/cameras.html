 Take a look at privacy issues of wearable cameras versus surveillance cameras in our society. . These might include cameras behind one-way mirrors in department store fitting rooms, employee changerooms in a Sheraton hotel, or video feeds taken off autoflush toilets, as well as the popular smoke-detector cameras. I consider the hidden cameras to be less acceptable than those that are out in the open. However, I find the camera in the baseball cap that TV shows use to be less invasive than the cameras hidden within the arthitecture; at least the cameras are attached to a person, and you know your not in private when somebody else is present.</td>

 . But it is up to us to decide if they are here to stay, and if they are, then under what conditions. Commonplace outside private companies, storefronts and apartment buildings, in parks and at intersections, surveillance cameras have been passively accepted as necessary for our personal safety. At this stage in their proliferation, we need to take an active, not passive, role in the decision-making process that allows for the installation of video surveillance cameras. But there is an equal, if not greater, number of situations in which cameras become not protective, but invasive.</td>
