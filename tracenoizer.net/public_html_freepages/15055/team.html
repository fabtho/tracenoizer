 Building the game is MUCH more fun that working on someone else's baby. I am a huge coop MP fan and gravitate towards games that offer me that possibility. It doesn't matter if it's a flight sim, a FPS, or an RPG - I love getting together with friends and working as a team to a common objective. I'm a pretty boring, conservative guy - I love spending time with my wife and our dog, especially outside. I'd probably count Diablo 2 and EverQuest as the other two.</td>
