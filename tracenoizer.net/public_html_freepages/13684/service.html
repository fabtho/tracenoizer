<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" The Supreme Court held that the application of the Florida statute was retrospective in the ex post facto sense because it substantially altered the consequences attached, not to conduct occurring after the law's effective date, but rather to criminal activities completed. The statute was held to be retrospective and thus violated the federal and state prohibitions against ex post facto legislation. The Supreme Court of Colorado held that because the contested statutory provision gave notice to the defendant and others who commenced service of a sentence for a felony conviction prior to the statute's effective date and further because the defendant's escape took place . well after the effective date of the challenged statute, no retrospective application is involved.
