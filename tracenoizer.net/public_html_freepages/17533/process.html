 STRUCTURAL TRANSFORMATION Beyond the technological advances, what is actually new about the so-called New Economy. As in the past, our advanced economy is primarily driven by how human psychology molds the value system that drives a competitive market economy. And that process is inextricably linked to human nature, which appears essentially immutable and, thus, anchors the future to the past. The global economic crisis that began in Asia in 1997 has caused growing concern that one of the fundamental hallmarks of the New Economy, the increasingly complex state of global interconnectedness, may in fact be a harbinger of financial chaos. Many of the Asian economies that were touted as economic miracles for the better part of this decade are now in profound economic and social disarray.</td>
