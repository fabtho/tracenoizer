 If you have any questions on this issue, feel free to contact C3 Resources. However, it is a crime not to use the latest in computer technology in your safety efforts. In gas processing, safety revolves around Process Safety Management (PSM), and PSM is built around data gathering and communicating this information to a large diverse group of people. Information technology allows this diverse group of people access to vast amounts of data, but also allows quick communication and interaction between people. A combination of knowledge and communication allows safety personnel to perform their job very efficiently.</td>
