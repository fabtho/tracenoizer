 As far as we know, it's impossible to fool Mother Nature. I thought it would be interesting to see what the basic laws of physics said about how fast, how small, and how powerful, computers can get. So in order to investigate this, I thought that a reasonable form of comparison would be to look at what I call the ultimate laptop. Let's ask just how powerful this computer could be. After working on this for nearly a year what I was able to show was that the laws of physics give absolute answers to how much information you could process with a kilogram of matter confined to a volume of one liter.</td>

 If the atmospheric tank is used for gravity separation of water, is this still an atmospheric tank. If the atmospheric tank has a vapor recovery system attached, is it still an atmospheric tank. What are the limits of a process in order to determine the 10,000 pound threshold. If atmospheric tanks are connected to processing equipment, are they exempt. This exemption is applicable to flammable liquids in tanks, containers and pipes used only for storage and transfer (to storage), and not connected to a process or a process vessel.</td>
