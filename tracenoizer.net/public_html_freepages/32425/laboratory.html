 Work When I came to UMBC, I worked for Learning Resource Center and for Computer Science department, where I was a tutor and grader for computer science courses. I also worked in LRC evening center and a CS help center. During final year of my undergraduate study and during my graduate study I work in Graphic Animation and Visualization Laboratory as a Research Assistant for professor Penny Rheingans. My main work is done in the area of scientific visualization. Current projects involve the visualization of uncertainty information I presented the paper Procedural Annotation of Uncertainty Information in October 11th at the conference IEEE Visualization 2000 in Salt Lake City, Utah (paper 5MB, slides, bibliography record).</td>
