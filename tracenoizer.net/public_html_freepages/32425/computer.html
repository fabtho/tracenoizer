 " If your god wants you to kill yourself and hundreds or thousands of innocent civilian people, then there is something wrong with your god. The words of "Fatwah" are therefore not the words of a god, but the words of a madman. Work When I came to UMBC, I worked for Learning Resource Center and for Computer Science department, where I was a tutor and grader for computer science courses. I also worked in LRC evening center and a CS help center.
