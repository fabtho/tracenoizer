 These techniques, currently used to model as many as one-third of the proteins in various genomes, will ultimately lead to expanded structure-based functional characterization of proteins and thus enhance the impact of various genome sequencing projects on biology and medicine. . NAME Lab Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics Andrej Sali Associate Professor Theories of protein folding and protein structure modeling. We are developing a homology protein structure modeling approach, which is based on sequence similarity between a structurally undefined target sequence and its structurally defined homologs. These techniques, currently used to model as many as one-third of the proteins in various genomes, will ultimately lead to expanded structure-based functional characterization of proteins and thus enhance the impact of various genome sequencing projects on biology and medicine.</td>

 Brglez and the CAD Benchmark Laboratory on upgoing research on Synthesis and Testing of Digital Integrated circuits. Interests I am interested in all aspects of VLSI design. My primary interest is in the logic sythesis, test generation and fault modeling problems in digital integrated circuits. I am also interested in FPGA design and hardware prototyping. To get access to my publications, use "find" in any of the subdirectories listed under CBL Publications.</td>
