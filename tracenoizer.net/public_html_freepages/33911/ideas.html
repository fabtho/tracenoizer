 Sometimes difficult results appeared with hardly a proof as if they were obvious to Wiener, while at other times he would give a lengthy proof of a triviality. The reader to whom he appears to be addressing himself seems to alternate in a random order between the layman, the undergraduate student of mathematics, the average mathematician, and Wiener himself. Despite the style of his papers, Wiener contributed some ideas of great importance. We have already mentioned above his work in 1921 in Brownian motion. He introduced a measure in the space of one dimensional paths which brings in probability concepts in a natural way.</td>
