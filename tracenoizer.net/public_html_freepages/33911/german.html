She joined her husband in the boarding house in Columbia, Missouri where their son Norbert was born in the following year. Not long after Norbert's birth a decision was taken to split the Modern Languages Department at the University of Missouri into separate departments of French and German.

There Leo brought in money by taking a variety of teaching and other positions and eventually was appointed as an Instructor in Slavic Languages at Harvard.</td>
