 , the Mathematics Department was predominantly a service department concerned with preparing students for engineering careers. In a manner which more pure mathematicians in the United States could emulate, Wiener did not hesitate to become interested in the problems of his engineering colleagues. When many years later the great English mathematician, Hardy, claimed that Wiener's engineering terminology was mere camouflage, he misunderstood both Wiener's motivations and sense of social responsibility. Even the purest of mathematics can be a potent tool in very practical pursuits, and Wiener felt that mathematicians, to be effective, need to realize that their labors are changing the nature of society. Most of Wiener's later mathematical work stemmed from his early interest in the study of irregularities and in his attempts to give meaningful mathematical descriptions of such irregularities, no matter where in nature they occur.</td>

 Among these were Blaschke, Menger and Frank who invited him to make a visit, while he also met Hahn, Artin and Goedel. Sometimes difficult results appeared with hardly a proof as if they were obvious to Wiener, while at other times he would give a lengthy proof of a triviality. The reader to whom he appears to be addressing himself seems to alternate in a random order between the layman, the undergraduate student of mathematics, the average mathematician, and Wiener himself. Despite the style of his papers, Wiener contributed some ideas of great importance. We have already mentioned above his work in 1921 in Brownian motion.</td>
