 Ordained subdeacon, Norbert was appointed to a canonry at Kanten. The Bishopric of Cambray was offered to him, but refused. Norbert allowed himself to be so carried away by pleasure that nothing short of a miracle of grace could make him lead the life of an earnest cleric. One day, while riding to Vreden, a village near Kanten, he was overtaken by a storm. A thunderbolt fell at his horse's feet; the frightened animal threw its rider, and for nearly an hour he lay like one dead.</td>

 Wiener had problems regarding his schooling, partly because the reading which he had done at home had meant that he was advanced in certain areas but much less so in others. His parents sent him to the Peabody School when he was seven years old and, after worrying about which class he should enter, had him begin in the third grade. After a short time his parents and teachers felt he would be better suited to the fourth grade and he was moved up a year. However, he certainly did not fit into the school in either grade and his teacher had little sympathy with so young a boy in the fourth grade yet lacking certain skills which would be expected the pupils at this stage in their education. Here my understanding was far beyond my manipulation, which was definitely poor.</td>
