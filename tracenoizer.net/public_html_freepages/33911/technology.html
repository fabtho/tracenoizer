 I've written this up in the essay "How Business Alliances Are the Key To Victory for the Free Software Movement". ." I believe that I have found a good answer, which has the potential to turn much of the information technology industry upsite down. I've written this up in the essay "How Business Alliances Are the Key To Victory for the Free Software Movement". .</td>

 I am grateful to the production team for creative input on exhibition design, especially Flieger and Killer, and I would also like to sincerely thank Aileen Derieg for translating the art server texts and for consistently wellfounded net-commentaries. The synergy effects and dynamics in the real-space art server O. K have made possible this experimental arrangement on net culture between art, technology and theory summarized here under the heading Art_Server. ..</td>

 this study introduced me to the theory of probability. Moreover, it led me very directly to the periodogram, and to the study of forms of harmonic analysis more general than the classical Fourier series and Fourier integral. All these concepts have combined with the engineering preoccupations of a professor of the Mathematical Institute of Technology to lead me to make both theoretical and practical advances in the theory of communication, and ultimately to found the discipline of cybernetics, which is in essence a statistical approach to the theory of communication. Thus, varied as my scientific interests seem to be, there has been a single thread connecting all of them from my first mature work . He returned to Europe frequently in the next few years, visiting mathematicians in England, France and Germany.</td>
