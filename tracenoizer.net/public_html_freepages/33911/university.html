 From his early youth Wiener, the prodigy, acquired intensive experience in the manipulation of both mathematical and linguistic symbols; but his career choice seemed initially little related to these skills. Perhaps in part due to his father's acquaintance with Walter B. Cannon, Norbert seemed sufficiently interested in biology to become a graduate student in zoology at Harvard University, after he had graduated at the age of 14 from Tufts College. But, in spite of his interest in the subject matter, Norbert had neither the manual skill nor the patience to do well in the graduate courses in biology of that era. I would see the end to be accomplished long before I could labor through the manipulative stages that were to bring me there.</td>

 . Because Leo Wiener was such a major influence on his son, we should give some background to his education and career. Leo Wiener attended medical school at the University of Warsaw but was unhappy with the profession so he went to Berlin where he began training as an engineer. This profession seemed only a little more interesting to him than the medical profession, and he emigrated to the United States having first landed in England. We should note that throughout his education Leo was interested in mathematics and, although he never used his mathematical skills in any jobs he held, it was a deep amateur interest to him all through his life.</td>
