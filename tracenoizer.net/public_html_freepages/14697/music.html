 This sound document attests to this transitional period and its artistic originality. Entirely instrumental, with drums as backbone, and guitars that seem to wave together a fine tapestry of ambient sound. Their music has been compared from anything from Low, Windsor For The Derby and Slint for their early releases; then they drew on the majesty of Godspeed You Black Emperor. Well, considering that this live recording is in between their first and second album, you know which way to think. Inaugurating the album is 'Waters', a winding, amorphous meditation upon waters' various characteristics.</td>
