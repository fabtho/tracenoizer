 However, the analyses show that this is not always the case when dynamic amplification is accounted for. . Thompson Doctor of Philosophy, Jesus College, University of Oxford, Trinity Term 1996 Development of Non-Linear Numerical Models Appropriate for the Analysis of Jack-up Units Summary Jack-up units have considerable economic significance because they are used to carry out a large proportion of the world's oil and gas exploration in water depths less than 90. Due to the increase in use of jack-ups in harsher environments, analysis techniques assuming quasi-static and linear structural behaviour have had to be reassessed. This thesis is concerned with non-linear dynamic analysis methods appropriate for a jack-up assessment.</td>

 Despite the fact that more than 3 years has elapsed between the issuance of the DEIS and the FEIS, nothing in the FEIS indicates that NHDOT and FHWA have assessed whether, pursuant to 23 C. 129, the DEIS should have been supplemented, or a new DEIS prepared, prior to the issuance of the FEIS. To the extent that the agencies involved may have engaged in such analysis, NHSC is greatly concerned that the agencies elected to proceed with the issuance of the FEIS. The DEIS and the FEIS contain information and analysis which is badly outdated and inaccurate. The FEIS fails to document or even acknowledged the recent discovery of an active bald eagle nest near the proposed route.</td>
