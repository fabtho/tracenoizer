Gutenberg set up another printing company in Mainz with the help of Konrad Humery. Many printers left Mainz at that time and spread the printing technology and skills throughout Germany and then to the rest of Europe. Gutenberg stayed in Mainz and petitioned the Church court for a secured position. It is unclear as to whether he continued his printing activities after 1465.">

 Dirichlet proved case 1 and presented his paper to the Paris Academy in July 1825. The complete proof was published in September 1825. On 28 November 1825 General Foy died and Dirichlet decided to return to Germany. He was encouraged in this by Alexander von Humboldt who made recommendations on his behalf. There was a problem for Dirichlet since in order to teach in a German university he needed an habilitation.</td>

 As a small but innovative archive it cooperates with other institutions and offers methodological seminars, e. In 1995 a small open-air exhibition at the Niederschoeneweide camp displayed the first research results. Our second aim, however, the setting up of a memorial, information and documentation centre on the history of forced labour in Nazi Germany is still being blocked by the authorities. Dutch survivors gave us their photos and organized commemorative ceremonies with us. We succeeded in helping the Association of Former Czech Slave Workers in Germany (Svaz Nucene Nasazenych) to show its well documented and illustrated exhibition in a German version in Berlin.</td>
