 A key component of an excellent education is the opportunity to interact closely with students, faculty and staff from a variety of different cultures and backgrounds. I came to IU first as a student in the 1970's; I have served in a variety of administrative positions, including Chancellor of IU-East and now Vice President of Diversity and Student Development. I believe that to prepare for the workplace of the 21st century, this university must value and embrace all people, and must be sure that our students graduate with an understanding of the complex and diverse nation in which we live. Our division, and the entire university, is resolutely committed to equity and excellence together; the academic success of each student is our primary goal. I invite you to explore the many opportunities for experiencing the richness of IU's diverse environment.</td>

 Examinations and papers further emphasize the development of critical thinking skills, an important skill for our graduating students. . Edwards currently teaches three courses at Washington State University. These courses are taught at the upper division and graduate levels. Application of principles taught in foundation chemistry, biochemistry, and microbiology courses to the science of food is stressed.</td>
