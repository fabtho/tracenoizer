 Pollard, the Institute of Historical Research is an important resource and meeting-place for scholars from all over the world. It contains an outstanding open-access library, runs courses and major conferences, offers research fellowships and other awards and produces many significant research aids and tools. The IHR web site provides information about all of these activities, and offers access to a wide range of electronic resources, from electronic journals to directories of historical research in UK universities, from catalogues of web sites for history to high quality learning and teaching material. It also acts as a bulletin board for the history profession in the UK, with information about conferences and events held throughout the country.
