 . PREVIOUS ENTRY Sweet Success SCIENCE ACTIVITY BOOKS NEXT ENTRY Thrill Ride. Targeting Students' Science Misconceptions, a teacher's guide containing directions for approximately 100 activities, is designed to help students identify and change their common, naive preconceptions and misconceptions about science topics. In doing these activities, students first state their ideas about a wide range of physical science concepts, and then they rethink or reconsider them after experimentation in the classroom. They try out the various options and come up with an answer based on their observations.</td>

 . Whether students have learning problems or physical challenges, they should be able to experience hands-on science with their fellow classmates. Facts On File believes that hands-on science activities should be available to ALL students. Children with learning disabilities or physical challenges should be able to participate in science experiments along side their classmates. That is the philosophy behind Science Projects for ALL Students.</td>
