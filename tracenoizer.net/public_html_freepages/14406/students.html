In doing these activities, students first state their ideas about a wide range of physical science concepts, and then they rethink or reconsider them after experimentation in the classroom. They try out the various options and come up with an answer based on their observations.">

 Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 27(10), 1033-1052. . Using Technology to Measure Change in Students' Science Learning Using Technology to Measure Change in Students' Science Learning Carl Berger and Charles Dershimer, University of Michigan Presented at the National Association for Research in Science Teaching Atlanta Georgia April 1993 Abstract The purpose of this study was to find if students became more consistant and purposeful as they became more familiar and successful with a microcomputer supported chemistry instructional program. A multimedia interactive software package was used as the learning environment. Students could navigate by clicking on icons that initiated the next event or state of learning.</td>

Development Fund for Black Students in Science and Technology The Development Fund For Black Students In Science And Technology A Nonprofit 501(c)(3) Tax-Exempt Organization The Development Fund for Black Students in Science and Technology (DFBSST) is an endowment fund which provides scholarships to African-American undergraduate students enrolled in scientific or technical fields of study at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). History The Fund was established by a group of concerned black technical professionals who realized that it is essential to provide financial assistance to talented black students who choose to pursue scientific or technical careers. Additionally, these students are supported at historically black institutions of higher learning, where it has been demonstrated that they will experience the highest rates of retention and graduation.</td>

Whether students have learning problems or physical challenges, they should be able to experience hands-on science with their fellow classmates. Facts On File believes that hands-on science activities should be available to ALL students. Children with learning disabilities or physical challenges should be able to participate in science experiments along side their classmates.</td>
