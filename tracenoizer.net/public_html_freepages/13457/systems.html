 at Harvard in 1997 and comes to us from Genentech where his development of new techniques for probing the functions of viral coat proteins was awarded a prestigious NIH National Research Service Award. While at Genentech he made other major breakthroughs in protein chemistry for which he has several patents pending. His appointment is part of our School's efforts to bridge the research of biology and the physical sciences and fits well with what is developing into a campus-wide systems biology initiative. His work ranges from the determination of the sulfur budget in the marine boundary layer to deciphering the atmospheric chemistry of the past 420,000 years using ice cores. He is regarded as a renaissance scientist in his skills and interests.</td>
