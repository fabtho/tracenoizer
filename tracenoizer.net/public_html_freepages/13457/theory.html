 . Zeman, Inner Models and Large Cardinals Zeman, Martin Inner Models and Large Cardinals 2002. The monograph contains a detailed presentation of general fine structure theory as well as a modern approach to the construction of small core models, namely those models containing at most one strong cardinal, together with some of their applications. The final part of the book is devoted to a new approach encompassing large inner models which admit many Woodin cardinals. The exposition is self-contained and does not assume any special prerequisities, which should make the text comprehensible not only to specialists but also to advanced students in Mathematical Logic and Set Theory.</td>

 The conference will be held on May 27 and May 28, 2001, on the U. The conference organizers are Steve Jackson, John Steel, and Hugh Woodin. This will be a four-day workshop on topics in set theory related to the Continuum Problem (broadly conceived). The workshop will be held at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (in Berkeley) on May 29-June 1, 2001, immediately after the Martin meeting. The workshop organizers are John Steel and Hugh Woodin.</td>
