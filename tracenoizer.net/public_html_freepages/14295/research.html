 . The course will allow you to focus on a particular subject-perhaps a studio, an independent production or industry topic that will become your specialty for the semester. You will be engaging in lively, in-depth discussions on practical issues and current events, sharing hands-on research through oral reports, and reading the trade paper Daily Variety each day to track your subject. While it is very exciting to examine the way the movie industry operates, the real work of the course is understanding and articulating your personal subject issues against the backdrop of the wider industry. In addition, the class will have weekly classes at Universal Studios to allow you to discuss your subject with executives in a seminar setting.</td>

Last year, the Faculty Senate proposed a long-term plan for the redistribution of recovered costs, which the University of Maine Administration neither adopted nor responded to in detail. Instead, the Administration retained the earlier draught plan from which the Senate's Committee on Research and Public Service had begun its deliberations. The Administration's plan was viewed inadequate in addressing how the University of Maine distributes indirect cost charges generated through research grants back to sub-units of the University in a manner that provides sufficient incentives to the university community to increase flows of indirect research funds to the University. The core substance of our previous Faculty Senate motion was not addressed.</td>
