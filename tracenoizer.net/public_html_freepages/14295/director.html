The Council meets to review the current activities of the College (recruitment, retention, enrollment, etc. ), consider curricular matters, review requirements and policies, and advise the director on issues of policy and guidelines. The Board meets in its entirety every two weeks or so; workgroups and committees get together on an irregular basis. Membership in the Faculty of the Honors College is conferred on those faculty members approved by the Honors Council to teach in the Honors Core Curriculum (preceptorials in Civilization or Science, or a tutorial).</td>
