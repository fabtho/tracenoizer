 Ubi Soft's colorful platformer sprawls over 18 levels in four environments. Within a level, Donald must track down three Energy Spheres, then find the Gyro-Gamma-Tubal-Teleport, which will warp him to the next level. Magic Books give a timed twist to standard collect-and-go fare. When Donald opens a Magic Book, he simultaneously charges the nearest Energy Sphere and starts a timer. Donald must then find the Energy Sphere before its energy runs out.</td>
