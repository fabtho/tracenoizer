 It is a must have for any serious Barks fan and for all of you who want to become one. This comic book is about Uncle Scrooge's past and his one and only girl friend. Naturally this splendid story is also about gold and Scrooge's love to money. It features all American titles (with an image for each comic story), dates of production and release, complete story index in both English and German. Although this book was made for the German market it still has a lot of useful information for the Barks Comic collector.</td>

 (The publisher once claimed one in four Norwegians reads Donald Duck every week. When the DD ban was proposed, we received a million (I counted) clippings from various newspapers read by our friends who were delighted to find something with which to give him a little garbage. ) In any case, my ex- ended up calling his mother in Kuopio, and asking her to clip and send any Finnish news articles that she could find relating to the story. The proposed ban was real, but the motivations were political in some murky Northern sort of way. It was never intended to be taken seriously; someone was trying to make a point.</td>
