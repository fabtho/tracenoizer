Initiated in the fall of 1992, the SRC is a grass-roots, self-governed teacher research community. One of the distinguishing and critical features of the SRC is that the research questions that drive current and future studies have come directly from the teacher-researchers themselves, as opposed to questions that might emanate from university researchers or their larger NRRC research agenda.

 How can people like me share their ideas as you do this study. . A research study is a way for finding answers to difficult scientific or health questions. For example, scientists may want to understand more about how AIDS is spread by asking people about their activities in a survey. Another example is when doctors might do a research study to find out whether a new medicine helps people improve their eyesight.</td>
