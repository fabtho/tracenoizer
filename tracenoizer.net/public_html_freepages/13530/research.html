 . The mission of the SRC is to conduct and report teacher-directed classroom-based inquiry that informs practice and enlightens theory for literacy professionals. Initiated in the fall of 1992, the SRC is a grass-roots, self-governed teacher research community. One of the distinguishing and critical features of the SRC is that the research questions that drive current and future studies have come directly from the teacher-researchers themselves, as opposed to questions that might emanate from university researchers or their larger NRRC research agenda. This paper describes the evolution of the research questions that guide SRC studies.</td>
