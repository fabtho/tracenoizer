 The SecurCore SC110 is identical to the SC100 but incorporates a cryptographic coprocessor to accelerate execution of standards-based cryptographic algorithms. The SecurCore family is a range of low-power 32-bit RISC microprocessor cores optimized for smart card and secure applications. Other members of the SecurCore family include the SC200 core and SC210 macrocell which incorporate Jazelle technology acceleration for Java Card applications. ..</td>

 To date, more than 100 countries in five continents have allocated frequency bands for DECT applications. 4GHz ISM band, are repeating the success story in the US market. From its origins in Europe, DECT is now a global technology. From its early days, Tality (then Symbionics) has contributed to the development of the DECT standard. 4 GHz products based around current chip sets from leading DECT IC manufacturers.</td>
