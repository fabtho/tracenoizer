 In 1959, we introduced the world's first generation digital computer for commercial use. For our existing customers, we offer a fast, cost-efficient WDPF-to-Ovation migration program as well as the latest technology for valve positioning. The new tools, OvationTune and Unit Calibration Advisor, make it easy to improve plant efficiency and profitability. OvationTune automatically provides optimal PID parameter values for process loops, allowing faster plant start-up as well as online adjustments of tuning parameters to enhance process efficiency. The Unit Calibration Advisor enables plant engineers and operators to re-tune a plant's control system to adjust for field drive element wear and tear, thereby reducing operating costs and improving plant profitability.</td>
