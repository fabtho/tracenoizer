 Click here to see how the timing of SPC ties into other quality tools. . SPC is a method of monitoring a process during its operation in order to control the quality of the products while they are being produced -- rather than relying on inspection to find problems after the fact. It involves gathering information about the product, or the process itself, on a near real-time basis so that the operator can take action on the process. This is done in order to identify special causes of variation and other non-normal processing conditions, thus bringing the process under statistical control and reducing variation.</td>
