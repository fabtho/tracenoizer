 Click here to see how the timing of SPC ties into other quality tools. . SPC is a method of monitoring a process during its operation in order to control the quality of the products while they are being produced -- rather than relying on inspection to find problems after the fact. It involves gathering information about the product, or the process itself, on a near real-time basis so that the operator can take action on the process. This is done in order to identify special causes of variation and other non-normal processing conditions, thus bringing the process under statistical control and reducing variation.</td>

 For this reason, it is difficult to find examples of subdivisions that are sustainable. If the developer of a subdivision or housing development wishes to incorporate sustainability into the project design, he or she most likely will consider some form of planned community, or form of development which considers the land-use aspect in a more environmentally sound manner. Subdivisions are the development form most closely associated with sprawl, a negative land-use pattern that consumes inordinate amounts of land and resources and is now becoming recognized as a major threat to quality of life in America and other developed countries. It also provides case studies, with emphasis on housing developments, including single-family homes and master-planned developments of various forms and scale. For additional background information, see the CESD sections on Land Use Planning and Green Buildings.</td>
