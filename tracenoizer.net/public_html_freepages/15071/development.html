 For example, project costs can be reduced, buyers or renters will spend less to operate green buildings, and developers can differentiate themselves from the crowd--getting a big marketing boost. For this reason, it is difficult to find examples of subdivisions that are sustainable. If the developer of a subdivision or housing development wishes to incorporate sustainability into the project design, he or she most likely will consider some form of planned community, or form of development which considers the land-use aspect in a more environmentally sound manner. Subdivisions are the development form most closely associated with sprawl, a negative land-use pattern that consumes inordinate amounts of land and resources and is now becoming recognized as a major threat to quality of life in America and other developed countries. It also provides case studies, with emphasis on housing developments, including single-family homes and master-planned developments of various forms and scale.</td>
