 My Name is Joe is deeply committed to its characters; underlying humanist ideals, this is an exacting and beautifully measured look at raw, forgot areas of life in '90s Britain. . Joe is Glaswegian hard man with a quick-draw temper but a basically sweet disposition, has got sober after years of alcoholism, pulling himself back from the brink because he has realised how violent he can be when he drinks. Joe is on the verge of middle age, edgy and anxious to make up for time wasted in the bottle. Slowly revealed in confidences and asides, the devastated emotional landscape that Joe's tough, bright exterior shields comes hurtling out of the past in a startling flashback.</td>
