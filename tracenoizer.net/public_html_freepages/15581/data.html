 Rainier support and Yamaha's exclusive Audio Master Quality Recording System. The need to install separate CD-mastering software or a hardware driver is a thing of the past as Yamaha's CRW3200EZ is the first CD recorder that can write to a CD as easily as a floppy disc drive. In addition, the exclusive new Audio Master Quality Recording System, designed by Yamaha, guarantees the best possible audio or data recording quality on conventional 74 or 80-minute CD-R discs.
