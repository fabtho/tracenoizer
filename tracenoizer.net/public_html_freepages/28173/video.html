<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" Guest performances by band members with other artists will be governed by that artist's policy. When Phish is performing at a festival or other event featuring multiple bands, that particular event's policy may override Phish's customary taping policy. All taping is limited to audio only - no video is ever allowed - and with microphones only (no soundboard patches). If a show is entirely general admission, then a tapers' ticket is not required. In an amphitheater, if there is a reserved pavilion and general admission lawn the taping section will be located behind the mix position in the pavilion and a designated taper's ticket will be required.">
