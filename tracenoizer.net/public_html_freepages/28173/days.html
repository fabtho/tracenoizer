Well, I've gotten pretty behind, and my shelves are lined with jewel cases with post-it note inserts. I've spent the past couple days scouring the better known art pages, and grabbed a few that I needed, but there are still dozens more to go. This is where you creative people out there come into play. And believe me, if you copy artwork from someone else's site and send it to me.">

 Aaron Patrick Vowels CBPA Dean's Suite (502) 852-6440 (502) 852-7557 (fax) aaron. . I did attend a class over the last couple of days that held the stance that it can be draining on the bandwidth and therefore can slow down the performance of the network. Also, if we disallow Internet radio in the offices, do we disallow it in dorm rooms as well because of the drain on the network. Do we allow Internet radio for special events, or ban it completely.</td>
