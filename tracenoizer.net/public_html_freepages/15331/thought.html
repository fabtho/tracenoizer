 But this one clearly stands out with gray metal textures on walls accented with blue and yellow lighting. The same texture theme is used throughout the map, but the use of different colored lighting makes some of the level look distinctively different in different areas of the map. Item placement is well thought out with emphasis on constant movement of all players during the match. The presence of a route or two that you can run to substantially increase your health and armor points isn't overbearing with the rest of the map in mind and overall, the map seems well balanced. Armor is not placed near the bigger weapons, although they may be close, which prevents that nagging urge to camp.</td>

 He joked he was the only one aware of circumference, of what a sphere was and meant - that he was the only one earth-bound, everyone else walking with stitched eyes and habits formed from childhood. He knew the sphere of stars and its awkwardness, how it shuddered above and below the equator, the rings of luminescent star-clouds and their satellites, give and take of unknown constellations. Someone fixed the stars, he thought, they were never when they were supposed to be. ______________ Llamas The llama glistened, black carapace covered within insistent tortoise plates gleaming in the brown air of noon. Sirens in the distance constantly changing, warding off violent cars close to veering out of control.</td>
