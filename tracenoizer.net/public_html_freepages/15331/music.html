 com January 21st 2001 I am researching the name CORDRAY and a place named Winstone Manor. com January 21st 2001 Hi, I will probably be visiting the Isle of Wight during the week starting January 29th. I am very interested in Folk and Traditional Music, especially Irish Music, but also that of other countries. Does anyone know where I might find such music on the IOW. Are there any Folk Clubs or Music-Friendly Pubs on the Island.</td>

 , who resides at 34 Buerger Road in Mobile, AL 36608-1801, writes that he is now serving as Vice-President of the Alabama High School of Mathematics and Science Foundation. He said the HSMS Foundation provides campus facilities through public and private donations and that the student tuitions are paid by public state funds. Spirited music was provided by Sam Raymond at the piano, Holly Raymond on drums, and Ed Sheldon on the clarinet. Attendees expressed interest in making this an annual event. As I was writing these notes the evening of December 22nd, I received a call from classmate Philip J.</td>

 It will be a limited edition available in the shops at the end of April, so keep your ears and eyes peeled for this one. We have had lots of support from various DJs including Laurent Garnier, Andrew Weatherall, Plump DJs and Nick Doherty from Fabric. There have been, not one but two reviews in Jockey Slut in February and March issues, stating that 'it is something of a treasure' and 'highly recommended' and in the current NME that 'it is elaborate and frequently beautiful electronic music'. In clubland, DJ has also gone straight into No3 in the 'Beats Chart' in the March issue of DJ magazine, and no 13 in the 'Student Dance Chart' in the current issue of 7. Thank you for all the support and a big shout to the folk playing it on Radio 1 session, Beat FM in Glasgow, and across the student radio networks.</td>
