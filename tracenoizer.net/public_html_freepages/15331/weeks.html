 His three sons are all graduates of Notre Dame University. Skiing has been the family sport in the Byrne household and he visits his sons while the snow is still nice. Spring, summer and fall will usually find the family using the travel trailer in Florida, New Hampshire or South Carolina for two to five weeks each year. Phil has retired from his mechanical engineering career and is enjoying retirement with his family. Believe it or not, I went skiing in the Atlas Mountains of French Morocco where I worked from June 1951 until May 1953 building air bases for the U.</td>

 Next thing I know I was going over 100 mph to make it home to Scituate,MA to get some sailing in. I rigged the boat in record time and remembered to put the plugs in for once. After my last trip about two weeks ago you guys were telling me I should not be sailing alone and stuff like that, you should really try it. To keep the catastrophe down I wear a 5-4-3 wetsuit under my clothes. As long as I stay within a mile or so my risk is also cut down.</td>
