 A great variety of weapons can be found through out the level with the exception of the BFG, but with the tight corridors found in this map, it would have been overkill. All of this brings me to what are arguably this map's best features. This map is in no way a huge map, but it took me a couple of times playing through it before I felt comfortable with where every item and weapon was located. The map is not symmetrical and feels like labyrinth when playing for the first time. There are no dead end hallways other than the occasional staircase you can get behind to pick up items.</td>

 I had a perfect day and survived to tell you guys about it. Hi, I went sailing today and it was like victory at sea. I got both hulls out of the water a few times when I was going upwind. When I was going downwind I thought I was going to pitchpole as I headed down each wave. I think if I went with the wind my boat would have become a plane.</td>
