 Item placement is well thought out with emphasis on constant movement of all players during the match. The presence of a route or two that you can run to substantially increase your health and armor points isn't overbearing with the rest of the map in mind and overall, the map seems well balanced. Armor is not placed near the bigger weapons, although they may be close, which prevents that nagging urge to camp. A great variety of weapons can be found through out the level with the exception of the BFG, but with the tight corridors found in this map, it would have been overkill. All of this brings me to what are arguably this map's best features.</td>

 January 11th 2001 Can anybody give details of a squash club near as possible to Mottistone and open early February. com January 5th 2001 I need agents (minimum age 16) in most areas of the Island (Brighstone, Shorwell, Cowes, Wootton especially urgent) to deliver a family magazine. There's no selling involved and I try to arrange for each agent to cover the area close to their home so there are no travelling costs either. If you would like more info, please email me with your phone number and I'll ring you with further details. com January 5th 2001 I am a scout leader and we are looking to come to the IOW in August.</td>
