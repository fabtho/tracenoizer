 Phil was going to spend the holidays with his daughter. His three sons are all graduates of Notre Dame University. Skiing has been the family sport in the Byrne household and he visits his sons while the snow is still nice. Spring, summer and fall will usually find the family using the travel trailer in Florida, New Hampshire or South Carolina for two to five weeks each year. Phil has retired from his mechanical engineering career and is enjoying retirement with his family.</td>

 They come in bright colors that kids and adults alike love. They are light and easy to pull even in the stickiest snow. They come in 5 different sizes for any member of the family. What started out as a Christmas present for my son Dustin Robert Sven, really caught on with the neighbours' children. So from "one" idea, just for fun, came the Svensen Toboggan Co.</td>
