 Together with learner-centered learning, it forces the learner to become actively involved. The wide range of applications for system dynamics makes it an excellent tool for integrating the material of many subjects. The System Dynamics in Education Project (SDEP) is a group of students and staff in the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, working under the guidance of Professor Jay W. road maps Road Maps The primary project of the group is writing the Road Maps series. Road Maps is a series of self-study guides that use modeling exercises and selected literature to provide a resource for learning about the principles and practices of system dynamics.</td>
