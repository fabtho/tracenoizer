 When sales fall, the boss gets nervous, rallies the troops, maybe tries a few threats. The next quarter, when sales go up, the boss pats himself on the back for turning around the situation and tells his people how great they are. What we really need to know is whether that last spike in sales was due to some action we took, or a random, expected fluke in the business cycle. Those below the average are taken out to the woodshed, those above it are rewarded. The question is, how many points below the average warrant action, and how many above it validate management decisions that were made.</td>
