 Of special importance are the unique natural and human circumstances that apply to each national park and its region; the need for a communication strategy to inform and bring together the many agencies, groups, and individuals typically involved, both inside and outside the parks; and a long-term interactive and adaptive planning approach. We outline details of these important considerations in ecosystem conservation planning and offer some general guidelines based on our experience to date.

IDC says the spatial information management (SIM) market will be more about spatially enabling business applications rather than building dedicated spatial applications. Location is a fundamental component of most business information architectures. SIM vendors that can help applications and tools vendors meet this demand will succeed, and those that choose not to help will find themselves competing for an increasingly small revenue pool in the traditional GIS space.</td>
