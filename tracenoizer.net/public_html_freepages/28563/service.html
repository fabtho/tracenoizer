 The staff of full-time Communications Support Coordinators at the NOC provides support for trouble calls related to the University's telecommunications services (voice, data, or video). The Staff also work to continually monitor and maintain the University's voice, video, and data networks to ensure that problems are identified and resolved quickly. Questions and inquiries to the NOC may range from restoring simple dial-tone service to solving complex network connectivity problems. Case numbers are assigned for all calls received and provided to the person reporting the trouble via e-mail. If the problem you are experiencing does not allow you to receive e-mail, a case number can be given to you upon request at the time of the trouble call.</td>
