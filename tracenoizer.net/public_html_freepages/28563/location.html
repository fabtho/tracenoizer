 This method is much like a traditional experiment, in that the researcher exposes subjects to certain circumstances or stimuli and then tests the responses of the subjects to what they were exposed to. The second major method of gathering primary data online is through the use of online focus groups. This method is also much like a traditional focus group, the main difference being that the participants are online and their geographic location is irrelevant to the study. This method is useful when a company wants to get an understanding of how people feel about certain products, company ads, or web site features. The third major method of gathering primary data online is by conducting online observations.</td>
