 Samhain is an innovative host based intrusion detection and file verification system. . We apologize for that, but as we have always stated, this site is a project between several people, and we post things as we have time. We have two new reviews that should be coming out soon, one on Kismet and another on BestCrypt. A little later down the road, we may do a comparison review with some of the Windows Applications that attempt to do the same things Kismet can do.</td>

 This book explained a lot about nutrition that I did not know, and mapped out a roadmap for regaining the 13 pounds I lost earlier in the year. I also added a section to our memorial page to remember note only people I knew who have died from AIDS but also other ways. Added a description of saline nasal irrigation to the Things From Wes' Nose section. ..</td>
