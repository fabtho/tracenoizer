 The homo sapiens species had undergone a radical transformation to a higher level of being. It had become the Homo Imaginative Sapiens species. People now had the power to visualize (see) abstract things within their mind, to form mental pictures of abstract concepts, to communicate these ideas with other other minds.

 Your arrival will be celebrated by our coven in a frenzied feast of blood. Feel free to partake in our wanton blasphemy, but bring your own bane-spirit. Do enjoy your stay at our great hall of soul-corrupting torture, though each minute spent in front of these chthonic runes, the farther down the spiral of madness your fevered mind shall travel. Fortunately for you, we've entered into an unholy pact that will grant our guests safe passage from the more nefarious spirits, but please beware the hell-hounds. .</td>
