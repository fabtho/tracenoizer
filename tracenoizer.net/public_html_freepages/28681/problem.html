 Artificial Intelligence's particular contribution lies largely in the development of heuristic search methods. . AI Chapter 4 - Nets and Basic Nets and Basic Search Search is an important problem-solving paradigm. Many real world problems can usually be modeled and transformed to some searching problems. Which Search Method is most efficient for this problem .</td>

 To overcome this "gray line," certain amounts of porcelain should be added to block out and make it "over-contour" (bulky). To prevent "over-contour" at gingival thin out margin area surface becomes rough causes all kinds of gum reaction and irritation. Technique (porcelain shoulder), which is our specialty, is one of the solutions to this type ("gray line") of problem. Technique cannot solve the concerned problem completely because a certain amount of reduction is required in the P. (Gold Blend) Technique doesn't need a "Shoulder Prep" like the P.</td>
