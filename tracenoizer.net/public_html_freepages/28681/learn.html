 I was looking for the birthday cake, but none materialized by the time the bell rang for classes. As my colleagues filed out, I could feel they were less taken with me than when they first walked in. Only later did I learn that in this country, the head of state is supposed to lay out for his own birthday. He serves his guests the cake (plus drinks), not the other way around. If he has a lot of close friends and family, he might well regret the day he was ever born.</td>

 An acknowledgement goes straight for the heart and soul. Even if the action doesn't work out, it has put the client in momentum, and that often helps the client get more experience in the real world, whereas developing instincts or awarenesses or insights from the discussion does not. When Joan hired a coach, she had to learn that she was expected to perform between sessions rather than just enjoy the conversation. What you can do is ask them to take action and to discuss during your coaching calls only the actions that they've taken rather than the insights they've had. Others attempt to manage their behavior rather than resolving the underlying cause.</td>
