 The program began to enroll families as of January 2000. This report provides an overview of the program, a description of staffing and staff development in this first year, a description of the planned local evaluation of the program over the next four years, and preliminary evaluation results. The last project scheduled for completion is the possible expansion of the Carter Street Recreation Center into a more comprehensive neighborhood center offering expanded services and programs to residents of the 14621 community. This appendix will continue to be updated on an annual basis until the next full community profile is released in the next year or two. The original report can be found in the Human Services Analysis section of this website by clicking the Areas of Impact Icon.</td>

 So if your company is tired of being forced into rigidly-defined programs that don't meet your rating and statistical needs, it may be time to give MSO a closer look. . Small to midsize insurers rely on our customized rating and statistical services to provide them with an easier, more profitable way to underwrite risks. MSO was created by and for small to mid-size insurers, and that will always be our target audience. As a result, we are not the largest rating and statistical bureau.</td>
