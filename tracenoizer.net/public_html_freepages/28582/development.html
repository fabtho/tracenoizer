 Dr Nidagundi Department of Geography Karnatak University Dharwad Karnataka India. . Valuation of Peri Urban Natural Resource Productivity Introduction Focus of research at the Department Ongoing and recent research Further information Research Seminars Contacts Links Contents Search Home Research Valuation of Peri Urban Natural Resource Productivity A research project funded by the Department for International Development (DFID) of the UK Government Despite considerable research into the valuation of natural resources, there remains a need to develop practical methods for assessing the relative worth of natural resource productivity within a peri-urban context. Natural resource managers do not presently have to hand tools to readily assess the relative worth of natural resources in alternative uses within the peri-urban interface context. The project will contribute to better understanding by natural resource managers of the values of natural resources in alternative uses, including how natural resources are valued by different stakeholders, particularly by poorer communities.</td>
