 We are, however, the most flexible and responsive for the companies we serve. The value our company subscribers derive from MSO goes well beyond the useful, marketing-oriented products we provide. Because at MSO, we're just as concerned with delivering quality service as we are quality products. That's why, unlike other bureaus, we do not add on costs for services like statistical reporting, computer programming and product filing. With no hidden costs, our member companies are free to pick and choose as many MSO support services as they need without fear or anxiety of exceeding their operating budgets.</td>

 We've helped some clients by pulling the needle out of their information haystack. We've helped other clients by evaluating proposals that they've been given. If you're busy and you don't have the background it's often hard to judge - do you rely on the glibness of the vendor, the quality of his suit, the number of buzzwords per page. As with our research, while we understand the magic languages used by lawyers, technologists, marketers and public servants we communicate with you in the way that best meets your needs. Detailed formal reports with more citations than you've had hot breakfasts.</td>
