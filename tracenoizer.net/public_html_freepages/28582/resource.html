 . Gate to My Links of the Month Links on environmental sustainability The productivity in using natural resources must be considerably improved in decades to come in order to ensure environmental sustainability. That means improving resource productivity or improving eco-efficiency. Science and technology hold the potential for this, but stimulating policies are required. Every month a number of links relevant to this to this issue are published on this web site.</td>

 . Rocky Mountain Institute is conducting research for an upcoming book. "Factor Four" contains 50 examples of at least quadrupled resource efficiency. In the next book, we'd like to include different examples (and not necessarily restricted to 4x improvements). For this reason, I'm asking all of you to please send me any examples that you may know of of projects in any sector that use resources at least twice as efficiently as standard practice (if you're not sure, please send it anyway).</td>

 Generally, we can get things quicker if we run out. Very few companies in the Rogue Valley add as much value to wood. He also hopes to expand his Web site, designed by his son, to include a chat room, registry for backyard bird sightings and a resource center. Additionally, he wants to start a local bird-feeder-filling service. .</td>
