 Recyclart, Ursulinenstraat 25 Rue des Ursulines, B-1000 Brussels Need to find the place. A nu-skool breaks event with local Belgian talent and you can get in for absolutely nothing. We've decided that it was time to give back to the Belgian breaks community that's been steadily growing over the last year, so to thank you all for making Essential what it is, and to hopefully introduce breaks to an even wider audience, we've decided to let you all party for free. Also, as this party is free, you can imagine we can't go off and print thousands of flyers like we usually do, or we'd end up with a pretty big hole in our collective pocket. So, in an attempt to do promotion in a completely different way, we've decided to ask you all for help.</td>

 For the early Christians, Easter was an ideal time to initiate new members into the Church. By the third century, Easter had extended to a full 50 days of festivity and joy. The Vigil of Easter had became the time for adult baptism -- with whole families coming into the Christian community -- and the time of preparation leading up to it became Lent. During Lent, the catechumens (those preparing to enter the Church) were expected to study, undergo exorcisms and fast. Soon that expectation spread to all members of the Church as well.</td>
