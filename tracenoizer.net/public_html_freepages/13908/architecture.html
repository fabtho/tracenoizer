 . Give Wired International Renew Reprints Customer Service BROWSE ARCHIVE Issue-Date 10. " The highly stylized 3-D graphs created by Asymptote Architecture contravene nearly every information-design principle advocated by Tufte - most significant, the ideal that design should serve the data and not the other way around. I puzzled for minutes over each graph, trying - and ultimately failing - to tease some meaning out of the gorgeously rendered surfaces. These graphs are the truest exemplars of what Tufte has called "chartjunk" that I have ever encountered; I hope he is able to feature them in future editions of his books as demonstrations of how the misuse of technology can decrease understanding.</td>
