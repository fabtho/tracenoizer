 When the ball goes airborne and smacks the underside of the glass - is there any better sound on Earth. A lot of the lament about how fragile pinball machines are, compared with videogames, could be addressed by making the friggin' flippers and solenoids more durable. I'm also bugged by the extra gadgets on the playfield, placed without any logic. I could have used a little less Dotmation graphics in exchange for better play. The trick was knowing that videogames and pinball require different skills and attract different players.</td>
