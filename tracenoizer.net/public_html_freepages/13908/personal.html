 10- The conspicuousness of the picturesque is inversely proportional to its importance. 15- Transgressions of taste are theoretical suicide. 16- In the realm of the personal there is no architecture, only taste. 17- Architectural research is an amusing little story. 18- Architecture, no matter how radically proposed, is always a socially sanctioned event.</td>

 I am surprised and disappointed thatWired was credulous enough to put him on the cover. But often the general public refuses to accept such radical ideas (they once thought the sun revolved around the Earth, after all). The possibilities for these implants - in personal identification, medical uses, and security - are endless. I'm a very sane person, but if I could make it over to Warwick's lab, I'd be first in line. I had not read anything truly revolutionary in a while, and Kevin Warwick's work has reinstilled my faith in science.</td>
