 In the first case, I am interested in the technology of operating a modern digitally recorded regional seismograph network. Over the past few years I have been involved in the development of much of the computer software for the real-time detection, recording, and automatic analysis of data from the Pacific Northwest Seismograph network. Recent developments of this system include the adaptation of the Earthworm seismic data acquisition and processing system to our needs here in the Pacific Northwest. This system and includes near real-time event processing and alarms which notify staff members of large earthquakes or equipment failure. Field work in the eastern Cascades and on Mount Rainier provide a break from sitting in front of a computer all day.</td>
