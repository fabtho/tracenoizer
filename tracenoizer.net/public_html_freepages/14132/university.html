 The module is organised by Dr Simon Riley in the Department of Reproductive and Developmental Sciences, and has generated tremendous support from participating schools. Pupils have found the sessions most useful and the medical students benefit by improving their confidence and communication skills to the age group on a difficult subject. It also provides useful links between the University, local community, and secondary education. As a reflection of the success of the project, James Jobanputra, a medical student now in his final year was recently invited to speak about the initiative at the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics Societies conference (FTGO) in Washington DC, the largest meeting in the world for this area of Medicine. .</td>
