 In addition, I have been involved in the conservation implications of the basic ecological work, with emphasis on reserve design and on economic linkages. . Much of my work is concerned with the evolution of diversification, the mechanisms sustaining biological diversity in natural systems, and the implications for ecosystem structure and functioning. The work integrates empirical studies and mathematical modeling, with emphasis upon how to extrapolate across scales of space, time and organizational complexity. The essential mathematical challenge is the development of macroscopic descriptions for the collective behavior of large and heterogeneous ensembles that are subject to continual evolutionary modification.</td>

 I hope in the future to have a page devoted to friends. . I am now working as a freelance information strategy and systems consultant. My interest in cognitive architecture is on the back burner for the moment, though I have several publications in this area as well as e-commerce and (related to LUSID) employability skills. I was also heavily involved with the conference IEC'99 - Innovation through Electronic Commerce in November 1999.</td>
