 Simon 1916-2001 Psychology Research Human beings use symbolic processes to solve problems, reason, speak and write, learn and invent. Over the past 45 years, cognitive psychology has built and tested empirical models of these processes as they are used to perform simple tasks and then more complex ones. The models take the form of computer programs that simulate human behavior. Computer programs have been built that can learn new skills by examining worked-out examples of solved problems. Using these programs as models, with colleagues in the Chinese Academy of Sciences, an entire secondary school mathematics curriculum has been designed (algebra and geometry) that is being used successfully in a score of Chinese schools.</td>
