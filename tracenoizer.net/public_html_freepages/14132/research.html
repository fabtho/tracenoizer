Research interests Reconstruction of geometry, material and illumination data from video sequences and photographs; Camera tracking and calibration for augmented reality; Illumination, perception, and rendering issues in augmented reality. Perceptually-based and parallel global illumination algorithms for rendering complex environments; Professional Activities Paul Debevec and myself are program co-chairs for the 13th Eurographics Workshop on Rendering, which will be held in Pisa, Italy, between 26th and 28th of June 2002 (in cooperation with ACM SIGGRAPH). I am also a member of the International Program Committee for Eurographics 2002, to be held in Saarbrucken, Germany, September 2002.</td>

 To access Herb Simon's complete bibliography click on the years listed below for a listing of publications for the corresponding time periods. . Simon 1916-2001 Psychology Research Human beings use symbolic processes to solve problems, reason, speak and write, learn and invent. Over the past 45 years, cognitive psychology has built and tested empirical models of these processes as they are used to perform simple tasks and then more complex ones. The models take the form of computer programs that simulate human behavior.</td>
