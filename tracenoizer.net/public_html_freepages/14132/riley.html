 As a reflection of the success of the project, James Jobanputra, a medical student now in his final year was recently invited to speak about the initiative at the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics Societies conference (FTGO) in Washington DC, the largest meeting in the world for this area of Medicine. . The module is organised by Dr Simon Riley in the Department of Reproductive and Developmental Sciences, and has generated tremendous support from participating schools. Pupils have found the sessions most useful and the medical students benefit by improving their confidence and communication skills to the age group on a difficult subject. It also provides useful links between the University, local community, and secondary education.</td>

 The man was among six crew of the Peterhead-registered vessel Radiant which sank 66 miles north west of Stornoway at about midnight. Four fishing vessels co-ordinated by the fisheries protection vessel Norna, a lifeboat and a coastguard vessel were helping with the search along with an RAF helicopter and a coastguard helicopter. Stornoway Coastguard district controller Simon Riley said the chances of finding the crewman alive were receding as time went on. " The six crewmen managed to scramble into a liferaft after their 33-metre boat sank after apparently snagging her nets. The man was lost when the liferaft itself overturned when it was in the water.</td>
