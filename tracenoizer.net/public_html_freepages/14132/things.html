 My interest in cognitive architecture is on the back burner for the moment, though I have several publications in this area as well as e-commerce and (related to LUSID) employability skills. I was also heavily involved with the conference IEC'99 - Innovation through Electronic Commerce in November 1999. During this time, and later, one of the most interesting things I was doing was leading the conceptual design of the Web systems for the Liverpool University Student Interactive Database (LUSID) project. I have taught school physics and maths, had children, lived a few fairly alternative years in Wales, etc. ) ideas on design guidelines for web pages, which is one of my connections with the HCI community.</td>

 This website is designed to be a guide to any 2nd year medics next year thinking of taking this option to know what the project may involve. All of us have gained a huge amount from this project. As well as learning a lot of things we didn't know before (both from Sarah Cavanagh and the pupils. ) it was also a great opportunity to meet people that as Medical Students, you wouldn't normally get to meet. We all found it really interesting to visit different parts of Edinburgh, and see what particular issues and problems affect teenagers there, and it was good to know that most of them found it really useful too.</td>
