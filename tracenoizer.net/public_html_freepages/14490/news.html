 Two companies, among many others, are trying to change the models. Diffusion proffers IntraExpress as a solution to the business delivery of different information to multiple recipients across a variety of media. Wayfarer Communications offers a way to blend information from the Web, news feeds and inside the organization into desktop harmony.
