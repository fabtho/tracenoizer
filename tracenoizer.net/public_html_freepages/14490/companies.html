 Sharpe Professor of Financial Economics, set out to investigate how this process works. The seeds of their recent research germinated in the notion that the key to culling information from the Web is sorting out the useful nuggets of news from the noise. Further reading about the effects of Internet disclosure on various companies' stock prices fueled their interest. In particular, their attention was drawn to the case of the 14-year-old New Jersey boy who got busted by the Securities and Exchange Commission for profiting by dabbling in stocks he had researched and touting those companies on the Internet. Pursued on the basis of manipulation laws, the boy's so-called crime is hard to distinguish from an analyst's role.</td>
