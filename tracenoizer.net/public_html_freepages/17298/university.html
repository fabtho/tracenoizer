 The visit to South Africa took, as its focus, business and management programmes. This report is one of a number of reports published from the summer 1999 overseas audit programme to South Africa. The audit examined the policies and procedures used by the University to satisfy itself of the academic quality and standards of its awards being offered in South Africa. The programmes covered by this partnership were a post experience programme which operates under the Integrated Manager Development Scheme (IMDS) and leads to a post experience certificate or diploma in Engineering Business Management; a master's programme leading to the MSc in Engineering Business Management which uses the operational title of Integrated Graduate Development Scheme (IGDS); and the Engineering Doctorate (EngD). The programmes provide progression for candidates where appropriate.</td>

"It's been frustrating," said Church, who plans to attend the University of Florida. If I tell someone the story, they don't believe me. "Springer, who will attend Stanford, says he simply followed the rules.</td>
