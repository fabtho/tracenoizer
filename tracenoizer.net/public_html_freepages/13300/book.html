 With millions of books in print, and nearly all of his 50-plus titles still available for sale, Dr. Seuss was, up until his untimely death in 1991, probably the most prolific living writer behind Barbara Cartland. In fact, his GREEN EGGS AND HAM is the third largest selling book in the English language. Seuss has lent his talent to advertising campaigns of the 1940s, political cartoons for PM, and a 1935 comic strip for Hearst publications called HEJJI, about a young lad's travels through the mythical land of Baako. Commendations awarded to Seuss include an Academy Award for best documentary short subject of 1945 for his writing and production of the propaganda piece YOUR JOB IN GERMANY (aka HITLER LIVES).</td>
