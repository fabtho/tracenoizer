 Old and New My Ghost Dog of the Solway paired with Kidnapped by Robert Louis Stevenson. My The Canine Cavalier paired with Children of the New Forest by Captain Marryat. Many of my books are set on the Scottish side of the Solway Firth. This is a very beautiful part of the country with a fascinating history. I have included a selection of photographs together with notes on the region.</td>
