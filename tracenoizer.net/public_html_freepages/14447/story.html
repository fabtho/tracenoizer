Dinosaurs are of course a staple of time travel stories, so that was one reason I brought one in.

 I've published four novels and more than fifty short stories. Sometimes it seems as though the stuff I write has the shelf life of lettuce. A story appears in a magazine and a month or so later it winds up in a corner of some basement -- or the landfill. And will be making a special guest appearance at the Music Hall in Portsmouth, NH on May 31st at 8PM in a play by yours truly. .</td>
