 Thirty six percent of the total population were of school going age (5 - 18 years). With much higher dependency needs this group necessitated higher levels of care and personal support. In addition, with the increased life expectancy of our adult service users, the Brothers of Charity Services recognises that a major area of service development in the future will be in services for the elderly. Recognising that integration is furthered by using local mainstream services where possible, the Brothers of Charity Services is committed to supporting the individual with an intellectual disability as a full member of their family and community. The organisation also recognises that there are many people in our services that require some form of residential programme or respite care.</td>
