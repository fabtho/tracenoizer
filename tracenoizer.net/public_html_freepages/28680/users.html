 .uk holds the personal Web pages of members of Oxford University with accounts on the OUCS systems, and also those of Oxford University Clubs and Societies. There is an index of individual users, which you can add your name to by logging into WING, choosing Manage from the main page, then Manage web space. You must have a Herald account to do this; if you only have an Ermine account, register for Herald now. Please note that the Clubs and Societies index is maintained by the Student Computer Users Group, not OUCS.</td>
