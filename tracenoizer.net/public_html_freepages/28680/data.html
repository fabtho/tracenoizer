 Ceres has been feeding its full-length gene sequence information from Arabidopsis and other plant species through its integrated assembly line of functional genomics technologies, generating a deep and broad knowledge base of plant genes and their functions as well as a substantial intellectual property position. The company has filed patent applications covering several tens of thousands of full-length genes, their regulatory regions and their functions in various plant species, including important crop plants. , has provided us with an early entry into plant gene sequencing and enabled us to rapidly build a critical mass of plant genomics data. Using our full suite of integrated functional genomics technologies we are rapidly translating gene sequence and function information into knowledge" remarked Ceres' President and Chief Executive Officer Walter De Logi. "This knowledge can be applied to target discovery for crop protection, molecular assisted breeding, as well as the development of high-value genetically enhanced plants.</td>
