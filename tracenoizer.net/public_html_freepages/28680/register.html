uk holds the personal Web pages of members of Oxford University with accounts on the OUCS systems, and also those of Oxford University Clubs and Societies. There is an index of individual users, which you can add your name to by logging into WING, choosing Manage from the main page, then Manage web space. You must have a Herald account to do this; if you only have an Ermine account, register for Herald now. Please note that the Clubs and Societies index is maintained by the Student Computer Users Group, not OUCS. Changes to indexes could take up to 24 hours to propagate.</td>

 6 Other Day Services 28 1 No Day Service 80 3 Annual Review 4 0. 1 Total 2,688 100 Autism The Brothers of Charity Services have become increasingly aware of the need for autism specific services. At present Health Boards maintain a manually held register but are in the process of developing a more formal register of autism to help identify the needs in this area and facilitate future service planning. In recent years there has been a significant increase in children presenting with autism. We feel that there is a need for increased collaboration between the Department of Education and Science, the Department of Health and Children, service providers and parents so as to devise and implement models of service provision and delivery in this area.</td>
