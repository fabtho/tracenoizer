 Its commercial portfolio includes gene discovery programs in CNS disorders, cardiovascular diseases, obesity and metabolic disorders; its pharmacogenomics programs for high-throughput target validation and drug response; and its gene libraries. . The program emphasized full-length cDNA sequencing as opposed to EST or partial gene sequencing in order to capture complete information on gene sequences and the encoded proteins. Such full-length cDNA sequences have been notably absent in other high-throughput gene sequencing programs because of the technical and organizational difficulties involved. Ceres has been feeding its full-length gene sequence information from Arabidopsis and other plant species through its integrated assembly line of functional genomics technologies, generating a deep and broad knowledge base of plant genes and their functions as well as a substantial intellectual property position.</td>
