 You'll find their singing deeply beguiling to the Western ear. Combining the elegance and intensity of European and American traditions of quartet playing, Orion maintains a unique place among chamber ensembles around the world. First off, they'll play a sumptuous intermezzo from the first quartet by a little-known contemporary of Tchaikovsky, Sergei Taneyev. And they'll conclude with a performance of Wynton Marsalis' "Hellbound Highball," a movement from the jazz master's extended work called "At the Octoroon Balls. " Orion's collaboration with Marsalis marks an exciting new chapter in this country's ongoing relationship between its classical and jazz cultures.</td>

 Players at the Spartak Moscow football club even complained that the lack of a proper anthem affected their morale and performance. Earlier this week in a television address, Putin defended the restoration of Alexander Alexandrov's rousing tune, saying his choice of symbols was meant to unite Russians by taking the best from their tumultuous history. Children's poet Sergei Mikhalkov will now rewrite the lyrics for a third time. Mikhalkov wrote the original, "An unbreakable union of free republics the Great Russia has sealed," in 1943 but amended the lines after Stalin's death to drop any mention of the dictator. Liberals say his backing of Soviet-era symbols shows a lack of respect for the millions of victims of Stalin's totalitarian rule.</td>
