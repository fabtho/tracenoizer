 . But now the new symbols have been adopted, the debate has died down and I am suddenly overwhelmed by the desire to express my opinion about these now official state symbols. During the anthem debate, the liberal intelligentsia argued that Alexander Alexandrov's music had been the "hymn of the Soviet Communist Party. " In reality, the Party's hymn was "The Internationale," which was also the anthem of the Soviet Union until 1942. In the middle of the war, Stalin made a series of decisions intended to break with the old communist-revolutionary symbols and traditions.</td>

The Soviet anthem, which cleverly combines musical features of both a march and a song, was written by Alexandrov in 1943, originally as the Communist Party anthem. Soviet leader Joseph Stalin approved the music and ordered the lyrics to be rewritten so the song could serve as the national anthem. After Stalin's death, lyrics praising him were dropped and eventually new lyrics were added retaining praise of Lenin and the Communist Party.</td>
