 . But now the new symbols have been adopted, the debate has died down and I am suddenly overwhelmed by the desire to express my opinion about these now official state symbols. During the anthem debate, the liberal intelligentsia argued that Alexander Alexandrov's music had been the "hymn of the Soviet Communist Party.

After Stalin's death, lyrics praising him were dropped and eventually new lyrics were added retaining praise of Lenin and the Communist Party.</td>

Sing to the Motherland,Home of the free,Bulwark of peoples and brotherhood strong. O, Party of Lenin, the strength of the people,To Communism's triumph lead us on.
