 . An Instruction Scheduling Library for SUIF - Chen, Young (ResearchIndex) A. The library builds on existing control-flow graph, data flow analysis, and memory disambiguation infrastructure from the SUIF system with machine SUIF extensions. It provides support for alias analysis, dependency analysis, modeling machine latencies, and modeling resource requirements. It also supports top-down and bottom-up instruction scheduling, as well as adding instructions to scheduled blocks.</td>

 Phoebe Chen, Andrew Brown, Xujuan Zhou, Greg Jenkins. The work combines a novel application area with databases in Bioinformatics. In this project, we present generic process solution Data Model Tools for L-Systems. L-systems, as defined by Lindenmayer, are context-sensitive parallel grammars. L-systems have been used in scientific work for quite a long time.</td>

 The goal of S3 is to develop new modeling and simulation technologies and a suite of novel software tools to enable interactive parallel simulations of global-scale, heterogeneous wireless telecommunications systems. Please see a prelimilary Java framework for large-scale distributed simulation to meet this challenge. Industry participation provides mechanisms for systematic technology transfer, access to real traffic data, and practical validation of the approach by concurrent use of prototype software tools for concrete problems. A project entitled "Common Runtime Systems for High Performance Data Parallel Languages" is pursued jointly by the above members of the Parallel Compiler and Runtime System Consortium (PCRC). Its goal is to develop a basic public domain infrastructure to provide runtime support for high level parallel languages.</td>
