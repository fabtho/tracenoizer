 . However, time series data does not support this hypothesis while cross section evidence is mixed. Given the ambiguity of empirical results, a theoretical model can help us explore the dynamic correlation between growth and inequality. Most of the existing growth theories formulate economic growth as the outcome of the technological change and underestimate the importance of educational system. Failure to describe the detailed process of human capital accumulation in the model misses an important linkage between economic growth and income distribution.</td>

 student at the Department of Petroleum Engineering, Stanford University, working with Prof. My research focuses on the multi-scale phenomena in reservoir modeling. The general objective is to develop a method or model to capture the subgrid (small scale) heterogeneity in a more rigorous and effective way. research was about modeling techniques for wellbore flows. Capturing Subgrid Effects in Coarse Scale Reservoir Models Introduction Methodology Work in Progress Introduction In science and engineering, many problems exhibit multiscale phenomena.</td>
