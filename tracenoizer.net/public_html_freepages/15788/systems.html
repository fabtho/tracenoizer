 Multimedia databases will play a significant role in the use of the Internet, for example in news-on-demand, video-on-demand and other such applications. Multimedia databases are an increasingly important area, which involve fascinating new issues beyond those of traditional databases. A rich content-oriented query language will provide more effective and more responsive multimedia systems. Through this project we have been developed custom-designed Interactive Finanace CD. Versions of the Interactive Finance CD are used in a number of leading Master-level business programs through Australia and the United States (e.</td>

 . I've enjoyed exploring both theoretical issues such as the complexity of certain algorithms and practical issues such as the effects of cache collisions on the performance of shared memory code. My dissertation is on preconditioners for computing eigenvalues and solving sparse linear systems of equations. For more on the classes I've taken, see my Classwork page. .</td>

 . Use of contrastive social-linguistic analysis of news reports in The China Daily over a period of time, coupled with a parallel analysis of the same texts for evidence of changes in what is and is not seen as reportable, can reveal both apparent and subliminal changes in the Chinese socio-cultural schemata, and can be a powerful tool for understanding the reality of socio-political change taking place in China. An area of research to be developed from my unpublished PhD on the functional-linguistic systems of MAK Halliday. Since his early work in the 1960s, little attempt has been made to further develop a functional linguistic Chinese grammar. The Teaching of English as a Foreign Language is a sophisticated science with a highly developed research base of its own and well-developed best-practices.</td>
