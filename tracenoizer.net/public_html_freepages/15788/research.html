 .edu When materials and devices are shrunk to a sufficiently small size, their electrical, optical, and thermal characteristics become distinctly different from those on a larger scale. Professor Chen's research addresses thermal problems in micron and nanoscale materials and devices using analytical, experimental and numerical methods. The goals of this research are (1) to understand fundamental heat transfer processes in small scales and (2) to solve important heat transfer problems in electrical and optical engineering and materials science. A list of research topics is available I have moved.</td>

 . My approach to studying issues and phenomena in both of these areas is heavily influenced by social-cognitive theory and methodology. For example, much of my research has addressed issues pertaining to knowledge activation and use, as well as to the automaticity of cognition and behavior. My research has also been informed by the large literature on dual-process approaches. In my view, integrating social-cognitive concepts and principles with the study of interpersonal and intergroup relations, and of the ways these relations shape the self and identity is useful for numerous reasons.</td>

 . Use of contrastive social-linguistic analysis of news reports in The China Daily over a period of time, coupled with a parallel analysis of the same texts for evidence of changes in what is and is not seen as reportable, can reveal both apparent and subliminal changes in the Chinese socio-cultural schemata, and can be a powerful tool for understanding the reality of socio-political change taking place in China. An area of research to be developed from my unpublished PhD on the functional-linguistic systems of MAK Halliday. Since his early work in the 1960s, little attempt has been made to further develop a functional linguistic Chinese grammar. The Teaching of English as a Foreign Language is a sophisticated science with a highly developed research base of its own and well-developed best-practices.</td>
