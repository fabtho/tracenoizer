 Deposit is applied to your last day's stay and will be refunded only if written cancellation is received 14 days prior to your arrival date. We bill by full day units with no deductions for meals or facilities not used. Our service charge applies only to the basic taxable wage for all of our staff and insures that all areas and facilities will be maintained and fully supervised. We believe that our staff is the finest in ranching. If you feel that you have been given exceptional service, tipping is a nice way to say 'thank you'.</td>
