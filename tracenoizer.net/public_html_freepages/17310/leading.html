 . Measles Initiative Each year, a disease barely remembered by most Americans kills nearly one million children, a half million of those in Africa alone. This fact makes measles the single leading cause of death among children in Africa - more than HIV, more than tuberculosis, and more than malaria. In a place where health conditions are extremely poor, living conditions are more than difficult, and access to health care is minimal, measles can be easily prevented with a simple vaccination. The Measles Initiative is a long-term commitment to control measles deaths in Africa by vaccinating 200 million children, preventing 1.</td>

, Tuskegee, AL) de Vaucouleurs (1958) found observationally that a sample of spiral galaxies had arms which trailed relative to disk rotation. Byrd, Freeman and Howard (1993) simulated NGC 4622's pattern with a small companion in a plunging retrograde orbit in the disk plane. This encounter created a single long-lived central leading arm. NGC 4378 is also a single armed galaxy (Rubin et al. Byrd, Freeman and Howard (1994) simulated the arm pattern of NGC 4378 by a direct planar grazing passage of a small galaxy predicting a single trailing tidal arm.</td>

 Forgot to uncomment a line (semicolons are comment marks). Accidentally left spaces at the start of an IN A, IN SOA or IN CNAME line. Leading space at the start of an IN A or IN CNAME line causes inability to ping to the name (and obviously if it can't be pinged, it can't be nslookuped or browsed to either). Leading space at the start of an IN SOA line causes a "Non-authoritative answer" response from nslookup, which indicates a subtle problem causing troubleshooting grief down the road. The search of hosts can take a long time if everything isn't set up just right, or if the hosts file lists servers that can't resolve names.</td>
