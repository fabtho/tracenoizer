 Quality physical education is not a specific curriculum or program; it reflects, instead, an instructional philosophy that emphasizes Providing intensive instruction in the motor and self-management skills needed to enjoy a wide variety of physical activity experiences, including competitive and noncompetitive activities. Keeping all students active for most of the class period. Influencing moral development by providing students with opportunities to assume leadership, cooperate with others, and accept responsibility for their own behavior. 22 Quality physical education is more than just fun, however; it is also a serious academic discipline. Physical education and health education are recognized as important components of the education curricula.</td>
