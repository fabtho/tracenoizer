 Physical education teaches students how to add the habit of physical activity into their daily lives by aligning instruction with the National Standards for Physical Education, and by providing content and learning experiences that develop the skills and desire to be active for life. The American Heart Association (1995) recommends that all children aged 5 years or older should engage in at least 30 minutes of daily physical activity at a moderate intensity and vigorous physical activity for 30 minutes at least 3 days per week. Acknowledgment of the contributions of school physical education to health led to the inclusion of two national objectives that are related to school physical education in Healthy People 2000, the U. The Surgeon General's report calls school-based physical education "the most widely available resource for promoting physical activity among young people in the United States," (Physical activity and health, 1996; p. 237) and recommends that "every effort should be made to encourage schools to require daily physical education in each grade and to promote physical activities that can be enjoyed throughout life.</td>

 One of the best ways to promote the widespread use of innovative practices and build support for quality school initiatives is to identify model programs that allow educators to learn from the successes of their peers. Expanding this initiative to more schools in more states would facilitate the dissemination of innovative practices. Training on implementing these curricula is provided for interested educators from state and local education agencies, departments of health, and national non-governmental organizations. To date, curricula have been identified that address tobacco-use prevention and HIV, sexually transmitted diseases (STD), and pregnancy prevention. Expanding this initiative to include programs that promote physical activity would help states and school districts make more informed curricular decisions.</td>
