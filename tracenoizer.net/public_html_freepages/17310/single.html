, Tuskegee, AL) de Vaucouleurs (1958) found observationally that a sample of spiral galaxies had arms which trailed relative to disk rotation. Byrd, Freeman and Howard (1993) simulated NGC 4622's pattern with a small companion in a plunging retrograde orbit in the disk plane. This encounter created a single long-lived central leading arm. NGC 4378 is also a single armed galaxy (Rubin et al. Byrd, Freeman and Howard (1994) simulated the arm pattern of NGC 4378 by a direct planar grazing passage of a small galaxy predicting a single trailing tidal arm.</td>

 . Measles Initiative Each year, a disease barely remembered by most Americans kills nearly one million children, a half million of those in Africa alone. This fact makes measles the single leading cause of death among children in Africa - more than HIV, more than tuberculosis, and more than malaria. In a place where health conditions are extremely poor, living conditions are more than difficult, and access to health care is minimal, measles can be easily prevented with a simple vaccination. The Measles Initiative is a long-term commitment to control measles deaths in Africa by vaccinating 200 million children, preventing 1.</td>

 That allows you to do lookups when some part of the system configuration is lying about where the DNS server resides. For instance, if you know your DNS server is at 192. 3, but the single argument nslookup call hangs, times out or isn't producing some meaningful output, some part of the system thinks the DNS server is somewhere other than 192. 3 as the second argument to override the IP the system thinks is the DNS server. If that doesn't work, you need to wonder whether 192.</td>
