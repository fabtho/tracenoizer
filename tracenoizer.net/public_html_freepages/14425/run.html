 He doesn't have hundreds of people in the race shop, just a loyal band of 60 that keep two race teams going at full speed. Anything less means the powerful teams can use their resources to win races. In short, if you're not spending in the lead pack, you can't run there. That's more money than Carter spends during an entire year on engines. When we have a definite number that race every week and we're coming to the point where we might not meet that number with full-time race teams, to me that shows the mechanics of the whole operation is incorrect.</td>

 The company's board of directors also announced it has formed a restructuring committee to "facilitate the management of the Company's restructuring efforts. " The change at the top of PSINet comes one week after the company's stock was delisted from the Nasdaq. PSINet officials recently announced that the company may soon run out of cash and it has hired Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein and Goldman Sachs to assist in exploring alternatives including the sale of all or part of the company. "Hopefully, they're trying to take a step away from the grave," said Lydia Leong, an ISP analyst with Gartner Group Dataquest. " PSINet has seen its financial situation deteriorate along with many other ISPs over the past year.</td>

 Sadly, it looks as if Shamlyan's brief reign as the modern master of suspense is over. . REVIEWED BY BILL HARDING Hannibal The Gift Proof of Life The Watcher Meet The Parents Way of the Gun The sixth day Unbreakable Bedazzled Space Cowboys Wonder Boys Gladiator Stigmata Circus Double Jeopardy Toy Story 2 The Beach Chicken Run Frequency Deception The Next Best Thing Shanghi Noon Cherry Falls American Beauty Snatch Blair Witch 2 Skulls Shaft 'You talkin' to me. ' Robert De Niro was great - make that the greatest - in the mid-seventies to the early nineties, when beautifully written, disturbing and moving roles like Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver, Jake La Motta in Raging Bull and James Conway kicked his career into the critical if not the box office stratosphere.
