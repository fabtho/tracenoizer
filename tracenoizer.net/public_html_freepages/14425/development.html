 ) the Protestant Work Ethic prepared the way to a vigorous domestic industry which in turn was a major factor in the eventual drive to political independence. In the meantime the first Industrial Revolution of the 18th century was centred in western Europe (mainly Britain) and based on the application of mechanical power and the use of coal. Soon freed by the development of the atmospheric steam engine from the need to locate industry adjacent to waterpower sites, manufacturies concentrated on the coalfields of the midlands and north of England. A transportation infrastructure was constructed in the form of a network of canals. In combination these and the accompanying activities may be thought of as an early manifestation of rapid, large-scale material resource exploitation and its effect on the national economy.</td>

 Goldschmidt was already a geneticist of international renown, especially famed for his studies of the geographical variation of genetic types of the gypsy moth, Lymannia dispar, in Japan. These variations included modifications of the strength of the sex determining factors, and threw light on the evolution of geographic races into species -- or so it was thought at the rime. Goldschmidt had also published a very influential book on the physiological basis of gene action during the course of an animal's development. At the time, however, Goldschmidt had remained unconvinced of the truth of the novel ideas of gene linkage within chromosomes, and the mapping of gene loci by the study of crossing over frequencies. Morgan and his students at Columbia University in a paper that Curt Stern, upon reading, felt was quite wrong, and Goldschmidr became aware of this.</td>

Cross-border shopping has increased each year and accounts for about 20 percent of sales revenue in the city.</td>
