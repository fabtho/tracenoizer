 Develop a maintenance and replacement program to ensure that the baseline package is serviceable and replaced during its five year life cycle. Broadly distribute a technology manual that includes standards, network architecture and product recommendations, and technology support and repair options. Maintain a pre-purchasing certification process to ensure that all technology acquisitions meet the standards and are consistent with the baseline technology goals. Require all new technology acquisitions to include provisions for installation, security, and maintenance and meet deployment standards. Identify school and library needs for instructional media and on-line resources and acquire district licenses for the most popular titles to reduce costs.</td>

 I loved movies and I understood how to tell a story. I wasn't articulate about it at the time, but I certainly got it. Hollywood's always hungry for young, aggressive people who at least get the process. Groveling for a little bit, trying to reach that ring to get an opportunity to show how talented they are. And Marty making Mean Streets, and Paul Schrader writing four or five movies that got made right away.</td>
