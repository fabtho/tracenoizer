 Like Ho's own Cubist piece that adorns the album cover, 'Universal' is a real masterpiece. . Having enjoyed huge critical acclaim with 'Voices' it's hardly surprising Ho hasn't gone off on a new artistic tangent for 'Universal'. Instead, his third album sees him refine his sound, drop the tempo and take in more jazz, ethnic and groovy house elements. It's best typified on tracks like the funky and down right sexy groove of 'Palace' or the textured, tech tones of 'Running', where insistently hypnotic percussion is fused with jazzy stabs to make music that is both challenging, inventive and entertaining.</td>
