Claire was committed to the concept of establishing an archive which would do the same vital rescue work for the Second World War as the Liddle Collection had done for the First World War. She was involved in the establishment of the Centre from the very beginning, becoming Secretary to the Trust and being appointed Acting Director. She now works alongside the Director, Peter Liddle, as Business Director of the Centre. With a German father and a German grandfather who himself served in the Second World War, Claire is particularly committed to the international scope of the Centre and its aim to document all aspects of Second World War personal experience, both Allied and Axis.</td>
