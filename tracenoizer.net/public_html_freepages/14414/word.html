 If you are interested in developing applications for use with PsiStack, download the SDK and BIN archives. Consult the SDK reference guide for more in-depth information about installing the SDK package on your PC. 05a, Matt stopped using Microsoft Word, with Internet Assistant 2. Previous versions of the documentation were available in PostScript for A4 and Letter printers. You'll have to produce these from Netscape yourself, should you need a printed copy.</td>
