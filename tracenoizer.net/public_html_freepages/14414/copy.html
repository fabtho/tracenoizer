 05a, Matt stopped using Microsoft Word, with Internet Assistant 2. Previous versions of the documentation were available in PostScript for A4 and Letter printers. You'll have to produce these from Netscape yourself, should you need a printed copy. Also, there is now no separate documentation archive. The relevant documentation comes with the relevant packages.</td>
