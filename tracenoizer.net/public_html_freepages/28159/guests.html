 Thanks again to the Nagoya Hilton, Himalaya Confectionary, and Takahara Shoten for donating other raffle prizes. . Four guests in particular deserve the distinction of having travelled the furthest to come back to NIS - Keiko Kiren came all the way from Canada, Clay Nishimoto and Kazuko Adachi-Nishimoto came via Hawaii, and the furthest was former teacher David Olson, who flew in all the way from South Africa. Thanks everyone who came, and hopefully there will be many more to come. Congratulations Hideko Ito ('75) , shown here with Sawae Hovde (teacher) and Kande Sheppard ('78).</td>
