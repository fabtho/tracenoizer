 We only need to use these bowl-shaped curves at the curviest parts of the complicated graph. Since we have only used straight lines and quadratic curves, we know everything about our approximation of the complicated graph.

 These all have drawbacks and may only be indicated in some countries. Their advantages are that they can be used to treat two conditions at once e. Amitriptyline if exacerbations are related to stress (but note that this drug has side effects that may cause particular problems in the older person). These drugs may not be available for the migraine indication in all countriesProphylaxis is only recommended when the patient has four or more attacks a month or they are especially severe, because of its many disadvantages. Acetaminophen (acetaminophen) is the drug of choice and a tricyclic antidepressant may be used if appropriate and if the side effects are tolerated by the patient.</td>

 However, this makes sense if there is a possibility that there are reads at unknown times that need an up to date version of a block. Preemptive Scheduling in Overloaded Systems (Extended Abstract) - Chrobak, al. It turns out, however, that for some scheduling problems it is possible to compute in an online fashion a solution that is within a constant factor of the optimum. An algorithm that approximates the optimal solution within a factor R is called R competitive. In addition to competitive analysis, online algorithms for scheduling are also sometimes studied in the framework called resource augmentation.</td>
