<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" Over the past weeks alone, more than a quarter of a million redundancies have been announced worldwide. Many of these redundancies are concentrated in information technology and related sectors and in some subsectors mass redundancies have affected virtually all major players. In many cases, the companies involved are multinationals which have been hit by the downturn in the US economy. It is thus probable that further cases of collective redundancies will occur if the US downturn persists. The social consequences of corporate restructuring decisions may be considerable.">

 Except for the Massachusetts State Scholarship, students retain their regular financial aid eligibility while studying abroad in a program which has been pre-approved for transfer credit toward completion of their UMass Lowell degree. . In most cases students have a cummulative grade point average of 2. While language immersion programs are one option, in most cases knowledge of a foreign language is not necessary. It is recommended to students that they work closely with their faculty advisor and the Advising Center in filling out the necessary paperwork such as a Petition to Study Abroad and an Authorization for Off-Campus Study form for each course taken abroad.</td>

 Patients who do not respond to drug withdrawal need to be referred to a headache specialist. This explains why typical acute treatments for episodic sufferers include migraine treatments. The drug is stopped perhaps 1 day per week to see if the cluster recurs and if so ergotamine is continued for a further week If ergotamine is unsuccessful sumatriptan, methysergide or verapamil can be given Lithium and corticosteroids are used for intractable cases. Complementary therapies and changes in lifestyle to avoid triggers may also be used to manage migraines. However, they are generally well tolerated, inexpensive, easily obtained and convenient Naproxen sodium and ibuprofen are only moderately effective Opioid analgesics should not usually be used for migraine.</td>
