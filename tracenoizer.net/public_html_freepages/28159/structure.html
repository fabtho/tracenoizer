 When teachers meet to carry out the Action Reflection Process, they are guided by a facilitator, who uses a variety of strategies to ensure a productive conversation. The team then records the key ideas on the action reflection tool. What anchors this ongoing conversation is a structure--a well-defined process for looking at the work of three focal students (one on an IEP, one at risk for failing, and one typically developing student). You can spend a lot of time describing a child's skills, but to have the piece of paper in front of you . Teachers are impressed with the strengths students exhibit, especially students with disabilities.</td>
