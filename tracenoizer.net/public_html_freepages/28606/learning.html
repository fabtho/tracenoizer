 . This mission has guided LRDC in its programs of research, its demonstration projects and its direct support of school improvement and reform. Reichle Media Highlights The Denver Post and Los Angeles Times editorial boards back the Institute for Learning. Isabel Beck on vocabulary in the Washington Post Kevin Crowley talks about physics and roller coasters with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. With public and private financial support, LRDC continues to study learning and teaching of basic cognitive skills and school subject matters, as well as the underpinnings and elements of effective learning environments.</td>

 Both development in technology as well as in substance itself are changing. The emphasis is moved from pure technical tasks to management and problem solving. Computer assisted learning (CAL) methods have been utilized and developed systematically already more than for ten years. Now we are discussing on virtual academies which will integrate all separate techniques and methods together. Still a lot of work must be done before distance learning in virtual universities is everyday work.</td>
