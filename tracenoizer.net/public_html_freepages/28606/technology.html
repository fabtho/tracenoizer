 BCT allows the Carter to be the only all-pull steel guitar whose changer fingers make direct contact with the wood in the steel guitar body. BCT changes the way the string energy is transferred throughout the steel guitar. BCT is a Unique Sound Transfer Technology that allows the pedal steel guitar to create a better tone and a more consistent sound. BCT has been built into Carters since late-July 1998. So, as of August 2001, over 600 Carter owners have had a chance to field test this new technology.</td>
