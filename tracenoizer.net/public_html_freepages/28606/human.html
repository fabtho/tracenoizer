 This one, similar in superficial ways, is a challenge to the imagination. It's as if European films have a more adult, inward, knowing way of dealing with the emotions, and Hollywood hasn't grown up enough. They're not in a position to do anything about or to answer any of our essential fundamental human and humanistic questions. Films that probe the fundamental question of the nature of human being, and the link between relationship and redemption. Perhaps most significant of all, the works rely on words from scripture --on I Corinthians 13-- to provide a subtext which cuts to the heart of the problem --the human condition, reflecting the persistent power of the word of God to shed light in the darkest places of human habitation.</td>

 On the other hand, we have experienced stunning advances in medicine, communications, the ability to understand the natural world in all its magnificence and complexity. And how does the Christian move about in all of this. The question that was once the domain of theology and philosophy -- What does it mean to be human. Inevitably, the marketplace teamed with science will produce ever more spectacular cures and ways of dealing with human frailty. The great danger, however, is that humans -- the very idea of humanity -- lies vulnerable to becoming one more commodity in the global marketplace.</td>

 . Performance Theory in an Anthropology Program Performance Theory in an Anthropology Program William O. In the most general sense these questions lead to a comparative analysis of human similarities and differences in all times and over all geographical locations. With this broad set of concerns in mind, in my teaching I help bring students to an understanding of performance as an inherently human activity. It is presented as having origins in pre-historic behavior and having functional value in the evolution of human cognitive functions.</td>

 In this paper we try to outline the aspects which we have recognized as necessary viewing points to education in FIG Commission 2 future work. In the work of the working groups the Commission tries to concentrate on selected, most important topics and also bring practical results which could improve both the substance and the methods of learning and teaching processes in educational institutions. Education is a complicated process in which both human and technical resources should be used in balance. Computers have caused changes both to teaching and learning methods as well as in the contents of courses.
