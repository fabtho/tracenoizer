 Driving large loads What is the most common media used in Solid State Disks (SSDs). Collecting data from an IP address (Ethernet or Internet) directly into Access, Excel, etc. These types of systems are often found in factories, laboratories, and machinery to provide programmable control of a complex system. These systems can be programmed with the same development tools used with full-size PCs which reduces the need and cost of custom development efforts. PCI gives peripherial devices more direct access to the CPU which can greatly improve system performance.</td>
