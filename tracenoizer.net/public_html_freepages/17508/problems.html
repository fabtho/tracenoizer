<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" Decisions based on precedent may be easier to defend but are not responsive to the variation in exotic species or natural system interactions over space and time. Thus, priorities set for managing exotic species based on precedent may not reflect current ecological and economic realities. On the other hand, consistently using an analytical toot such as the Exotic Species Ranking System, can ensure that ecological knowledge is applied to the decision process and can remedy some of the problems associated with decisions based on judgment and precedent alone. An analytical framework encourages researchers to consider the full range of factors and consequences of their decisions. An analytical framework documents the procedures and the reasons for the decisions made, thus reducing the risk aversion characteristic of park managers.">

 Any equipment at the User's site and the circuits necessary to connect the participant to the CalREN-2 network are the property and responsibility of the Participant. It is assumed that directly connected Users have the staff and ability to manage both the equipment connected to CalREN-2 and the circuits to their site. Directly Connected Users must have their own network operations center whose staff can work with the CalREN-2 Network Operations Center ("C2NOC") to resolve problems and for other support needs. C2NOC will not respond to or support the User's own end users directly. back to top Indirectly Connected Users Indirectly Connected Users are CENIC Associates who are sponsored by, connected to and entirely supported by a Directly Connected User.</td>

 Degrees 0 to 3 are supported by almost all parts of the Locfit code. Choices may be restricted when derivatives are required; e. In multivariate problems, "prod" uses a simplified product model which speeds up computations. family Local likelihood family; "gaussian"; "binomial"; "poisson"; "gamma" and "geom". Density and rate estimation families are "dens", "rate" and "hazard" (hazard rate).</td>
