 Many people enjoy the loudness of those and so to each their own. Since most of the P-flows are not legal here in California we do not sell many and do not install them except on the few CARB exempt models. When we tested James Sly's Turbo Golf 3 we found less HP with the funnel filter and the noise was annoying. Now as for a ram air system we have seen one from Europe and it might be something to try but another project for another day. the boost gauge was throw in a bag with other metal parts and got scratched.</td>
