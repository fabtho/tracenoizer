 These views come as no surprise as giving birth has always been prone to complications. Women in childbed often didn't survive the strain of the delivery or were unable to feed their offspring properly. Sometimes they even felt constrained to kill their babies either from fear of disgrace or poverty. If the baby was welcome, it had to be christened without delay, for people knew from experience that child mortality was at its highest during the first months. In spite of spiritual and medical security measures, many children died and had to be mourned.</td>

But a segment of the community has been openly critical about Switzerland's role promoting the accord, which critics say undermines Israel's elected government. "At the same time, the Foreign Ministry has been knowingly forgoing any cooperation with the Israeli government, even to the point of not informing the Israelis of their intentions.</td>
