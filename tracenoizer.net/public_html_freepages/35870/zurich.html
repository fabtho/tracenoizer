 Ein Beitrag zur Entwicklungsgeschichte bis zum Beginn des 20. Begleitband zur Ausstellung im Medizinhistorischen Museum der Universitaet Zuerich. Catalogue of the exhibition at the Museum of Medical History of the University of Zurich. Well into the 20th century a delivery was a serious risk for both mother and child - with life and death often closely linked in the act.
