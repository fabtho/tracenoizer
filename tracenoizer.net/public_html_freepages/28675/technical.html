 The Music Department sponsors three choruses of various competitive levels, the University Singers, the Concert Choir, and the Harding University Chorus. If you are interested in a vocal performance, groups like Belles and Beaux and the Good News Singers may be of interest. Harding has a wide variety of opportunities if you want to be active in technical theatre, performance, or both. There are at least three major shows a year, and several one act shows. If you are looking for something more personal, there are children's and performance groups like Pied Pipers, Theatron and the Campus Players.</td>
