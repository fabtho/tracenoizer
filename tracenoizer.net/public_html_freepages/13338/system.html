 org Related Sites As the Internet and networked systems become more widespread and advanced, there is a higher risk of accidents, attacks, and failures. Our research develops ways for critical systems to continue to provide essential services when they fail for any reason, and to recover quickly. Survivability is the ability of a network computing system to provide essential services in the presence of attacks and failures, and recover full services in a timely manner. It provides a view into systems in which local actors interact to produce system-wide emergent properties. all research papers Survivable Systems Engineering The field of survivable systems engineering explores the current state of systems to identify problems and propose engineering solutions.</td>
