 The following three fellows have their focus in the key areas of transport, infrastructure and land remediation as well as broader aspects. David is particularly keen to add value to both the local community and businesses, by identifying industry and regulatory problems associated with regeneration, particularly with regard to contaminated Brownfield sites. Before joining the University of Birmingham, he worked as a site engineer for Balfour Beatty Construction where he developed his management and contractual skills. He then went on to study for a PhD in environmental remediation, specifically stabilisation and solidification of contaminated soils and wastes. This aim will be met through the provision of workshops, continued professional development courses, research contracts, collaborative research proposals and student placements. David has 23 years experience in manufacturing, both in the UK and Europe working with high technology and process equipment based companies within a range of engineering sectors. David has additional experience as a lecturer working with small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) and students in business development and administration.
