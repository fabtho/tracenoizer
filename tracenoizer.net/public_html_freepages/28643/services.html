 Lesko's wardrobe is as much a part of his appeal as his frantic message - colorful clothes, like his suit covered with neon question marks, his mismatched bright socks, wild bow ties and a seemingly inexhaustible collection of eyeglasses in every color of the rainbow. He even drives the only Lexus with yellow polka dots. Matthew Lesko has published over 70 books showing everyday people how to get free services and products from the federal government. He has had two New York Times best-sellers and two national best sellers, Getting Yours and Information USA. In addition, Lesko has twice received the prestigious "Best Reference Book of the Year" award from the American Library Association and has written syndicated consumer columns for Good Housekeeping, The New York Times and The Chicago Tribune.</td>
