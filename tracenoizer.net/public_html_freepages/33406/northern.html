 This rapid growth rate in the Chesapeake Bay exemplifies the potential growth rate that this invasive species could have throughout the Flyway. Mute swan movement, inland up major river systems and out of the survey areas may have caused this lowed count. Although the northern New England States reported few birds, it is important to note that 13 years ago there were none (Vermont) or fewer (ME and NH) swans in this region. Maine reported a pair of mute swans with 4 cygnets on a remote lake in the north central section of the state. New Hampshire's population remains low, with birds found primarily in the coast zone.</td>
