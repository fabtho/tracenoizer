 There are good crops of crocus in spring, followed by daffodils, bluebells and orchids, and gorse is present in the northern side of the park. The Upper Lake is maintained as a wildlife area, and the larger Waterloo Lake is used for fishing. The Park has a natural ampitheatre which provides the venue for many special events ranging from sports days to major pop concerts and the spectacular bonfire and firework displays on 5th November . A lakeside cafe overlooks Waterloo Lake with an adventure playground nearby. .</td>

 This growth is seen throughout the Flyway, particularly in the Chesapeake Bay region (Maryland and Virginia) which has increased 1271. This rapid growth rate in the Chesapeake Bay exemplifies the potential growth rate that this invasive species could have throughout the Flyway. Mute swan movement, inland up major river systems and out of the survey areas may have caused this lowed count. Although the northern New England States reported few birds, it is important to note that 13 years ago there were none (Vermont) or fewer (ME and NH) swans in this region. Maine reported a pair of mute swans with 4 cygnets on a remote lake in the north central section of the state.</td>
