 A 'Potted History' of Roundhay Park Roundhay in the thirteenth century was a three square mile hunting park for the DeLacy family of Pontefract Castle. The entire estate was purchased by the City in 1872 and opened as a public park by His Royal Highness Prince Arthur on the 19th of September 1872. At the time, the then Lord Mayor John Barran was ridiculed for buying a 'White Elephant' - in that the park was too far out of the city for the majority of the population to enjoy, and in any event the park had just one access road - an old 'turnpike' road dating from 1808. During the 1950's and 1960's about 100,000 people a year visited the 'swimming baths'. The park comprises over 700 acres of parkland, lakes and woodland.</td>

 Remember, however, that it is illegal to remove archaeological materials from public lands. It was already far too thick for its width and was therefore thrown away. The photo was taken on site against a white backdrop. On the left are two quarry rejects; on the right, two projectile point parts, a tip and a base, broken in the process of manufacturing. They were photographed on site against a white backdrop.</td>
