 Good numbers of Skylark, Reed Bunting, Sedge Warbler and Whitethroat were resident at Lower Burgh meadow. However, negative news from the site concerned the young of one of the pairs of Great Crested Grebes, which were allegedly killed by the other pair of adults. At the north end, Great Crested Grebe and juvenile, Sand Martin and Garden Warbler were present on the 30th. A Little Owl was at Lisieux Hall fields on the 15th.

 Mute swan movement, inland up major river systems and out of the survey areas may have caused this lowed count. Although the northern New England States reported few birds, it is important to note that 13 years ago there were none (Vermont) or fewer (ME and NH) swans in this region. Maine reported a pair of mute swans with 4 cygnets on a remote lake in the north central section of the state. New Hampshire's population remains low, with birds found primarily in the coast zone. Vermont had no swan sightings, a decrease since 1996 (11), attributed to a new mute swan management policy.</td>
