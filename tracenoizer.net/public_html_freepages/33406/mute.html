 The ecology, distribution, and abundance of the mute swan (Cygnus olor) in Rhode Island. . AFC Mid-summer Mute Swan Survey Report Mid-summer Mute Swan Survey Report Atlantic Flyway Council and Technical Section July 2000 The 1999 Mid-Summer Mute Swan Survey (MSMSS) was completed during August and September. Survey data was not collected in Canada, however, so the overall mute swan population is under counted. Canadian reports for the previous MSMSS indicated static growth.</td>

 A Woodcock was regularly seen roding over a member's garden in the Heapey area. At Birkacre, two pairs of Great Crested Grebes had each produced three young by the 16th. The resident pair of Mute Swans managed 6 cygnets this year (21st), the best for a few years. A pair of second summer Mute Swans had been seen on Lower Rivington reservoir on the 4th. On the same day a female Siskin was still visiting a garden feeding station close by, and pairs of Bullfinches were still visiting feeding stations at two or three gardens in the area.</td>

 This application has become the means for accessing needed funds. The review and approval process of applications is relatively quick. The requests have included funds for attorney fees for obtaining legal guardianship of a child who is deaf and mute, summer camp for a special needs child, and airfare for an out of state child with autistim. Often the allowed amount may be insufficient to meet the complete needs of the child so it is essential that all available resources be exhausted before applying for these funds. As time proceeds we have the expectation that this statewide fund will enlarge and be able to meet the needs of many families who utilize the CRCG within their county.</td>
