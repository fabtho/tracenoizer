 The corporate takeover of agriculture, the collapse of biodiversity, and the unpredictable results of letting engineered life forms 'into the wild' are just a handful of the doubts surrounding the biological revolution. But to be cautious does not imply a lemming like return to the illusory mbosom of Big Mamma Nature. Technoscience is the intersection point of the information and life sciences, where the technological marries the living in a bid to conquer death and disease, endow life with the utility of technology and technology with the kiss of life. its economic dimension becomes the real Surgeon General presiding over the birth of this technoscientific progeny. .</td>

 The earliest Americans arrived with tools in hand, and these tools were of the Neolithic type. Today those who replicate the stone tools of the past are called flintknappers, and there are trade journals, conventions, and Internet sites devoted to the avocation. In Victorian America, the knowledge of stone tool technology was in its infancy, despite the fact that in that age of exploration, stone-age societies were being observed and documented. Observing and documenting is always one step behind the practice of doing, and the mechanics behind fracturing stone did not become widely known until archaeologists began experimenting on their own. It was accessible and very large, and the stone supply was abundant quartzite.</td>
