 The production goals of the quarry worker were thin, leaf-shaped quartzite blades. These roughed-out quarry blanks were carried home to village sites, further reduced in size, sharpened by further thinning, and then styled into a variety of edged tools. The first official report of worked stone at Piney Branch was published in the 1880s by the United States Geological survey. Florida Avenue was then the city boundary, and Fourteenth Street, extended, was the access route to the quarry. Obtaining permission from the landowner, Thomas Blagden, Holmes began his archaeological investigation on the bluffs above Piney Branch Stream northwest of Fourteenth Road extended.</td>

 The original proposal asked each site to address this issue during the term of the grant. Three of the grant sites have definite plans to form a non-profit organization with key CRCG member involvement. In one site's final report, it was noted that the CRCG intended to share its grant outcomes with key community leaders of local agencies and local county boards (commissioners) with a request for continuing integrated funding. Other local foundations would be approached with a similar request for funding. The overall consensus is that the grant dollars definitely enhanced and expanded the role of the each of these four grant sites.</td>
