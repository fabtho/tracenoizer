 This issue is a hot one and until now has often been influenced by the many personalities involved. This has been unfortunate to watch because a project with nearly universal support like this is seldom seen. That fact was finally recognized Monday night, and we can hope that as planning continues we can avoid such unnecessary hard feelings. The council's deliberation hasn't happened fast enough for some of the private parties involved. Now that action has at last been taken, it's up to them to show us (via the IRRRB) more of the project's financial details.</td>

 But the practice green remains not only a good place to practice putting, it's also a good place to practice etiquette as well. They're not mandatory, but they are advisable, especially on weekends or holidays. Suppose you wanted to take a friend to a trendy restaurant on Friday night. You wouldn't expect to be seated immediately without first calling ahead and reserving a table. A tee time assures your place by assigning a specific starting time.</td>
