 This appears to be a deliberate attempt on the part of this company to ensure that its employees send mutilated mail. It's probably better not to allow 8 bit characters, though I haven't seen any problems in this area. I wasn't able do this on this system; it insisted on automatic wrapping, and the only choice I had was where (lines of between 30 and 132 characters). This has the advantage of stopping the single-line per paragraph problems, but often enough there are requirements where you want a line to be longer than 132 characters (when quoting long output lines or URLs, for example), and this breaks them. On the other hand, normal text should never get to be 132 characters long, so it's unlikely to break quoted text.</td>
