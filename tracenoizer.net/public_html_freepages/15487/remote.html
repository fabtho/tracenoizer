 Current research by the remote sensing group is to understand the statistical properties associated with different land cover types particularly in coastal regions. . Center for Space Research Remote Sensing Group Information Features Technical Projects Publications Presentations Data Catalog Internal Links The Center for Space Research Remote Sensing group is working toward the development of advanced image processing algorithms which can be applied to airborne and satellite imagery to better understand changes affecting the planet. The remote sensing group's efforts have been focused on developing methods to characterize and model the spectral and spatial features from both optical and microwave sensors. Current research by the remote sensing group is to understand the statistical properties associated with different land cover types particularly in coastal regions.</td>

 . In particular, the treatment of different image data sets in multiple combinations with optimum degree of geometric accuracy is required for the exact geographic location of individual ground features, especially in mountainous regions. Moreover, multisensor remote sensing data have to be made available to be used in geographic information systems or environmental monitoring systems. Hence, based on many years of research in the field of remote sensing, the Institute for Digital Image Processing of JOANNEUM RESEARCH has developed RSG - the Remote Sensing software package Graz. The RSG software package is designed as comprehensive and versatile as possible for geometric processing and quality assessment of digital multisensor remote sensing data.</td>
