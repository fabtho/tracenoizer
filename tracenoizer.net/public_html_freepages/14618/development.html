 Fast Track is a multisite intervention project aimed at reducing adolescent conduct disorder via a long-term, multifaceted intervention; my role is as statistician with the project's Data Center. My training is in social psychology, with a focus on attribution processes, person perception, and self-perception. My current research interests include methodology for testing hypotheses of mediation, the etiology and prevention of adolescent health risk behaviors, the development and nature of ethnic identity, and the psychological impact of perceived discrimination. Long-standing interests also include the development of identity more generally, the nature and implications of different levels of self-esteem, cognitive and motivational processes of attribution and self-perception, and the nature of academic giftedness and creative processing. These pages include material relating to my professional experience and activities.</td>
