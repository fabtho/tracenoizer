 We celebrate the contributions of different outlooks and cultures within a context of openness. Personal support includes two student Deans, Registrarial staff and a Chaplain. The College has a Bursary and Scholarship programme, a Computer Centre and an excellent Library. See our Student Services page for a summary of the resources available to students. A high number go on to professional programmes or undertake graduate studies, often earning major scholarships.</td>

 I have two areas of primary research interest, network seismology and volcano seismology. In the first case, I am interested in the technology of operating a modern digitally recorded regional seismograph network. Over the past few years I have been involved in the development of much of the computer software for the real-time detection, recording, and automatic analysis of data from the Pacific Northwest Seismograph network. Recent developments of this system include the adaptation of the Earthworm seismic data acquisition and processing system to our needs here in the Pacific Northwest. This system and includes near real-time event processing and alarms which notify staff members of large earthquakes or equipment failure.</td>
