There is the "Free Miles" sections, as well as a full listing on what partnership specials are out there from 5,000 bonus miles for long distance service, to the best frequent flyer credit cards. The best thing is the site is not affiliated with any airline so has news and opportunities for just about any airline you can imagine. It's, well, frightening how many men look like Kenny Rogers. Not only does this site have scores of pictures of Kenny-looking fellas, but it gives you tips on where to find more men who look like the Gambler.">
