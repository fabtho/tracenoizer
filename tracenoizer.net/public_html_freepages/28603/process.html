Center for Process Analytical Chemistry, Washington University The objective of the Center for Process Analytical Chemistry (CPAC) is to develop real-time measurement and relevant data handling techniques. Through its consortium of industrial sponsors and several national laboratories and government agencies, CPAC addresses challenges in monitoring production processes for effective modeling and control.</td>
