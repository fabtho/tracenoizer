 Having used these methods for many years, we have found it not only improves quality, but also reduces delays which can occur through the delivery of wrong materials to the jobsite. . To us, quality control is conformance to the plans and specifications, and we are dedicated to insure that these contractual requirements are adhered to. Before quality can be achieved at the jobsite, the necessary preliminary work must be accomplished to assure that the proper materials are delivered on a timely basis. This is accomplished through thorough and detailed checking of shop drawings along with the familiarity with materials, suppliers and subcontractors that the completion of projects generates.</td>

 Free Appropriate Public Education The provision of a free appropriate public education based on the unique needs of the child is at the heart of the IDEA. Similarly, the section 504 regulation at 34 CFR 104. 36 contains free appropriate public education requirements, which are also applicable to local educational agencies serving children who are deaf. A child is receiving an appropriate education when all of the requirements in the statute and the regulations are met. The Secretary believes that full consideration of the unique needs of a child who is deaf will help to ensure the provision of an appropriate education.</td>
