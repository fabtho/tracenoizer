 The phrase sends shivers down the spines of cash-strapped college students everywhere. The increase seems meager when UA students consider the scope of needs facing the university. From professors' salaries and teaching assistant (TA) salaries to improvements in advising and information technology, a tuition increase could have a direct impact on the quality of education UA students receive. Arizona students should not object to an increase that could have substantial benefits. While each area needs attention, Likins' plan to pay for UA's construction debt is problematic.</td>
