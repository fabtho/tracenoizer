The guidance further suggested that care be organised, as far as possible, in community rather than institutional settings. The co-ordination of services required was acknowledged as a special challenge and one that would rely on multi agency approaches to ensure that the right services, in the right locations, were available when required. Each local agency received a digest report on progress in their area. The attached Care Pathway Document adds to the information available to agencies by providing a further means of assessing what action is required locally towards completing a co-ordinated response to safe care and accommodation for this group.">
