 But the golden age of our home culture that came after a very short (both from historical and human points of view) flash of Pushkin's genius was far beyond the horizon. Longing for world culture, if it is still alive, - is longing for Pushkin's epoch this time. The heights of Russian culture - are not so much ethical perfection as serving to conscience. Moral measuring of public actions is undoubtedly, the merit of Russian culture. In Russia literature and philology became the basis of it and it is not only our writers' merit but also the fact that philology is the main peculiarity of our home culture.</td>

It would be good to know exactly what those Russian-American agreements were about. Please help, you will do a good thing and help lots of people. There are more than 19 NGOs and 300 members in the division.</td>

 Mendy gave Nazarov a big lesson ; he led the action with his jab and hook to the head ans body. As a champion, Nazarov reacted as a hurt man but still the challenger won with a fair decision on points. The 2nd world championship of the night was between Julien Lorcy and Alexander Alexandrov for the WBO title, unfortunetely, Lorcy was once again dominated on points by the russian Alexandrov. Lorcy was not in his best physical condition and finished exhausted. .</td>
