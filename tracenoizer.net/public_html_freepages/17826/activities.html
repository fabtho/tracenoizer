 But by placing hard bitumen on top of the sealing surface of the banked oval, these problems should be avoided. However, the work has resulted in the postponement of the BARC Championship race meeting scheduled for the weekend of the April 27-28. "Although that means track activities, including the BARC meeting and ASCAR Spring Training, will be postponed, our priority is to solve the problem with the 'weepers' on the oval and we will do whatever is necessary to make that happen. "We are working with the British Automobile Racing Club to find an alternative date later in the year. "On behalf of Rockingham I would like to apologise to the competitors and fans for any inconvenience caused, but Rockingham is still the best motor sport venue in the country for both drivers and spectators and I look forward to welcoming the BARC back in the near future.</td>

 The Superintendent charged the group with the task of developing a curriculum framework to support the established learner standards. The group's shared vision is included in the sections which follow. Activities focused on identifying the major dimensions, or strands, around which the curriculum should be organized and on developing the academic standards and benchmarks associated with the agreed-upon strands. The most difficult issue for the group to resolve pertained to whether the curriculum should be structured on the basic academic disciplines or in an alternative form which would better support the committee's vision of a quality curriculum. .</td>

 In the second part, Describing Patterns, examples of various ways students might interpret the same sequence of cubes are given. This illustrates the importance of discussing and analyzing patterns in the classroom. 2 Investigating the Concept of Triangle and Properties of Polygons This two-part example describes activities using interactive geoboards to help students identify simple geometric shapes, describe their properties, and develop spatial sense. In the second part, Creating Polygons, students make and compare a various polygons, describing the salient properties of the shapes they create. Both parts help students reach the goals described in the Geometry Standard.</td>
