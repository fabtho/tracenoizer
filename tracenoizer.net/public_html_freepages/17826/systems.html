 Hardware Configuration Software Configuration Linux Guests User Requirements Technical Support Porting Hints and Tips Registration Hardware Configuration LCDS System 9672 G6 Model ZX7 (10 way processor) Memory 32GB DASD Shark 2105-F20 (2. 1 terabytes) Network The network configuration is a direct Internet connection with open access to the Linux guest machines from the WWW. Software Configuration The LCDS mainframe is supported by an IBM Virtual Machine, established to support a large number of guest systems. With registration approval, you are given access to a guest system to accommodate your Linux project. We have found that an SSH1 RSA key is implemented with minimum efforts.</td>

 Properly appropriated, research overhead income could supplement and substitute for shrinking clinical income. Clinical research programs are vital to improve the health of patients throughout Kansas. Research opportunities for faculty, students, and residents have been limited in Wichita because of limited resources and inadequate support systems. Exploration of research opportunities in Wichita by the other KU campuses is needed. Little collaborative research has occurred between KU-Lawrence, KU-School of Medicine-Kansas City, KU-School of Medicine-Wichita and WSU.</td>

 Several kinds of source to source program transformations such as program specialization, program parallelization (including granularity control), inclusion of run-time tests for assertions which cannot be checked completely at compile-time, etc. ciaopp is distributed under the GNU general public license. lpdoc generates a reference manual automatically from one or more source files for a logic program (including ISO-Prolog, Ciao, many CLP systems, . It is particularly useful for documenting library modules, for which it automatically generates a description of the module interface. A fundamental advantage of using lpdoc to document programs is that it is much easier to maintain a true correspondence between the program and its documentation, and to identify precisely to what version of the program a given printed manual corresponds.</td>
