 A quote from the Internet, "don't worry about the future. Or worry, but know that worrying is as effective as trying to solve an algebraic equation by chewing bubblegum. " Like a man on a tightrope, we're all tempted to freeze in times of danger. The only way a tight- ropewalker can keep his balance is by moving forward. Self-development depends on our doing something else, something more, something different, something new.</td>

 We will be there on Saturday and Sunday, March 16th and 17th, from 9 A. If you can do a half day on Saturday, an afternoon on Sunday, or just an hour or two, it will be greatly appreciated. There will be sign-up sheets at our next general meeting, or you can contact SSAS's Therese Lucas and let her know which dates and times you can be there. WE THANK THE HOLIDAY PARTY VOLUNTEERS SSAS's perennial wildlife-oriented holiday party for children was held on December 15 at Tackapausha Museum and we'd like to thank our volunteers. We'd also like to thank falconers Bob Young and Sonny Squiciarino for providing the free live-raptor show.</td>

 Qualities of a good coach include business experience, honesty, a strategic mind and people and communication skills, says Johnson. Well-known businesswoman Wendy Luhabe is one such coach, while Spoornet's recently appointed CEO Zandile Jakavula has benefited form personal coaching. Take Johnnic executive director Irene Charnley, who, on winning the Businesswoman of the Year award, thanked Rand Merchant Bank's Wendy Lucas-Bull for encouraging her through tough times and being her sounding board for often non-conformist ideas. But not all executives have such close, personal mentors. Take the autocratic MD, who has years of skills and experience but is struggling to understand and adapt to an Internet-enabled business world, where young whizz-kids seem to rule.</td>
