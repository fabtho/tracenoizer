<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" . This project investigates a database management system that supports a meta-query language with which users can design their own visual query languages to specify both the data to retrieve and the display format. Theoretical aspects of the research address the characterization of classes of visual queries that can be evaluated with guaranteed time-complexity by providing a careful design of the query evaluation engine. Practical goals include the implementation of a database management system supporting visual queries, the dissemination of results using the WWW, and the transfer of technology. The project has a strong educational component, seeking the involvement of graduate and undergraduate students and the inclusion of prototypes in the classroom so as to reflect the more interactive and visual aspects of today's computer science.">

 . Tremendous growth continues in Web use, Web search engines, and Web sites. The interdisciplinary scope of Web research is broadening, and is now an important topic for publication in prestigious scientific journals such as Science and Nature. We are beginning to map the nature of users' Web interactions and the dimensions of better Web systems. However, researchers' and users struggle daily with the tough problems inherent in a system used for general interaction and e-commerce on a massive scale.</td>

 . Contributions like these help us achieve the unique goals we cannot attain fully from state funding. We use such gifts to provide for the expenses of visiting lecturers; to fund our graduate students' travel to professional conferences at which they are reading papers; to subsidize graduate student travel to distant facilities necessary to their dissertation research; and to secure special equipment that enhances undergraduate and graduate instruction and facilitates the work of the faculty and staff.
