 The meeting noted that there have been notable successes as a result of the partnership between government and the business sector. Co-operation on priority crimes such as organised crime and vehicle syndicates. Improvement of service delivery trough mechanisms such as the provision of technology and management skills to the various components of the criminal justice system. Deputy President Zuma said the work of BAC was a practical example of the spirit of voluntarism and called for an extension of this spirit to other sectors and spheres of South African society. He said the partnership between BAC and government showed that something concrete was being done to fight crime in the country, and called for this pro-active initiative to be replicated.</td>
