 . I am sure they will all be proud to be part of this great American nation, and I hope their Romanian heritage will enrich their life as well. I often hear about the legacy of Swiss, German or Irish heritages, for example, but it seems so little is written or known about Romania. As people ask me where I am from, I learn that only very few know where Romania is located. I believe it would be such a loss for our children if they were to know nothing about their heritage, as roots are such an important part of who we are and who we become.</td>

 To not only the Turks but also to many of his own countrymen he was Vlad The Impaler, Vlad Die Tepes (pronounced Tee-pish). Dracula built a defense around him that dared not open kindness nor trust to anyone. During his tenure, he killed by the droves, impaling on a forest of spikes around his castle thousands of subjects who he saw as either traitors, would-be traitors or enemies to the security of Romania and the Roman Catholic Church. Sometimes, he slew merely to show other possible insurgents and criminals just what their fate would be if they became troublesome. And there are countless of other tales of Dracula's wickedness written down ages ago, many of which will be related in this article.</td>
