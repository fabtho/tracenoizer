 Not primarily about Dracula, but includes discussion of pre-Rice vampires. . Stoker wrote a number of other novels and short stories, several of which (The Jewel of Seven Stars and Lair of the White Worm, to mention just a couple of the novels) also have major supernaturalist elements. That book makes no mention of the historical Dracula's obscene cruelties, which Stoker of course does not mention. Translation of a 1488 pamphlet purporting to document the evils of Prince Vlad.</td>

 . But Dracula realy lived long before the novel was written. In Bram Stoker's novel Count Dracula lives nearby the Borgo pass in the Transylvanian Carpathians in todays North-east-Romania. Harker initially stays with Dracula as his guest but quickly finds himself a prisoner (and a bite victim). One morning, as Harker looks frantically around the castle for an escape hatch, he stumbles upon a crypt where a number of coffin-like boxes of earth are stored.</td>
