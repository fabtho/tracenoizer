 The country of Wallachia was a principality, meaning that it was ruled by a prince, rather than a king. Dracul was a member of The Order of the Dragon (a position from which he derived his surname). The Order of the Dragon was a group of Slavic rulers and warlords who were sworn to uphold the Christian faith by fighting off the advancing Turks of the Ottoman Empire. Warfare was almost continuous in Wallachia and the surrounding areas at that period of history. This bargaining was viewed as treason by John Hunyadi, (the King of Hungary in fact if not in name, and the most powerful member of the Order of the Dragon.</td>

 . He was born into the Basarab family, the son of Vlad II. His father was Vlad Dracul, a soldier who commanded one of the units guarding the Wallachian-Transylvanian border, which was susceptible to attacks from both Turks and Hungarians. Dracul is thought to derive from either the Romanian word for devil, or from the knightly order of dragons that Daddy Dracul pledged his loyalty to. An interested reader, Daemon866, informs me that the name of Dracul was assumed after Daddy Vlad entered the Dragon order.</td>
