At the beginning of the deportations in the fall of 1941, a new - larger - wave of refugees from Vienna to Hungary commenced. Many refugees managed to go into hiding and live as "U-Boote". Those refugees who were arrested, were collected in four small internment camps in Budapest and later detained in one of the five larger provincial camps.</td>
