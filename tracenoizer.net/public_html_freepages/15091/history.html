 McKay doesn't bowl over listeners with breathtaking metaphor or puzzling obliqueness--his songwriting style is fairly straightforward. However, he possesses a knack for keenly and sincerely bringing to life people, places and times from throughout his life. In this release, we get to know some of the history and characters from a part of New Jersey heretofore unknown to most non-Garden Staters, the farming area around Secaucus. For I have joined the elders now and I must take my stand in the furnace of humility I will trust His mighty hand. Ownership, copyright and title of this folk music CD review belongs to me, Kevin McCarthy.</td>
