<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" While many studies have provided evidence of this concern, few have explored the nature of the concern in detail, especially for the online environment. With this study, we have tried to better understand the nature of online privacy concerns; we look beyond the fact that people are concerned and attempt to understand how they are concerned. We hope our results will help inform both policy decisions as well as the development of technology tools that can assist Internet users in protecting their privacy. We present results here from the analysis of 381 questionnaires completed between November 6 and November 13, 1998 by American Internet users. While this is not a statistically representative sample of US Internet users, our respondents are heavy Internet users, and quite possibly lead innovators.">

 Schmolze The KL-ONE Family Computer and Mathematics with Applications, 23(2--5), pp 133--177. . When this happens, users get creative and the intended semantics of the notation is easily cast aside for an operational semantics determined by what the algorithms do (to the extent that they can be understood). In many cases, users have creatively used these systems to achieve behaviour that was not intended by the designers.
