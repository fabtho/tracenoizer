 Clutch, of course (who can forget the NCAA shot versus Ole Miss. Has good leadership qualities -- Valpo made the NCAAs all 4 years he was there. Looks like a late 1st round pick at the moment, but a good performance in Chicago could raise his stock. I saw him at Valpo's camps and he is hands down the best shooter in the draft.
