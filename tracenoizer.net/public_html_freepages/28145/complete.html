 I have taken a stab at defining what I feel would be a good "Director's Cut" of this movie which blends the best of all the available versions. Maybe Amy Heckerling will one day agree to release something similar to this as an offical "Director's Cut" as has been done for Blade Runner and other films. My approach to creating this director's cut was to start with the most complete version, the broadcast TV version, and edit from there. As a result, if a scene is the same in all the versions I usually selected the broadcast TV version as the source. Interestingly, this edit comes closest of all to following the novel and screenplay.</td>

 First published in 1791, this more sought after second edition was published , correcting the errors that appeared in the 1791 edition. Bound and rebacked with calf, gilt embossed label on spine, marbled boards. A detailed and complete original day-to-day account of the construction of the famed Eddystone Lighthouse by the design engineer himself. A very detailed account, particularly of the repeated frustrations and efforts of the designers and workers at this exposed site, the storms and rescues and their ultimate success. This was Smeaton's first project as civil engineer.</td>
