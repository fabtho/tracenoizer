 Completed on line career plan at beginning of unit, no revision. Frequently used on line interviews and had one chat session with students participating in the on line chat about careers as documented in sign in log. Used at least three resources to research trends, wages, general and local outlook of career choices resulting in footnoted information in written report material. Prepares final written report using a word processor that incorporates internal citations from research collected, comments on their findings and a summary of their career plan at end of unit.

 Paper consumption was drastically reduced thanks to appropriate measures. . Environmental Report - Material and energy balance I Content Back Forward Material and energy balance The breakdown of the total material consumption in 1996 is shown as a percentage by weight. The consumption of raw materials, process materials, and packaging materials decreased versus the previous year despite the increase in production. Paper consumption was drastically reduced thanks to appropriate measures.</td>

 Reports for unrestricted distribution often contain summarized, or abstracted information. . JTEC report on Material Handling Technologies in Japan, summary. EDU The JTEC approach is to choose a topic for study and then select a panel of 6-8 US experts, who are leading authorities in the field, technically active, and knowledgeable about both Japanese and US research programs. Panelists spend considerable time in the US reviewing relevant material and then the panel (as a group) spends about one week in Japan conducting extensive tours of Japanese labs from industry, academia, and government.</td>
