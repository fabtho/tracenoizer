 4 The County Council has a statutory responsibility with districts and the Police Authority to have crime and disorder strategies in place in each district by 1 April 1999. The contingency sum was intended to support the County's new responsibilities which span all County Council services. Part of the contingency has been used in connection with the review of levels and patterns of crime and disorder in each area - this work is now substantially complete and the analysis of the results of the review is under way. The next phase is to prepare an analysis of the results of the review, followed by publishing a report of the analysis and widespread consultations. These consultations will then be used to inform the final version of the strategies which will need to be ready for approval early in the New Year.</td>
