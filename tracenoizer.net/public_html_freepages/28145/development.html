 The result has been an acceleration in the application of automated material handling systems that dwarfs what we see occurring in the United States. The evidence is fairly clear that factors such as declining population, aging work force, changes in work preferences, and the ever-present congestion and lack of space are fueling the use of automation in Japan. The corollary in this case is that demand (application and use of automated material handling technologies) fuels supply, which translates into a rationale for ongoing research and product development. In many cases, economies of scale in the production of material handling equipment can also be associated with high demand levels. Automated material handling equipment and systems in Japan are not deployed exclusively in large,complex integrated systems.</td>
