 Meanwhile, please, let us all support the boycott of Pennsylvania products, businesses and tourism. NB In France, we are thinking of adopting the front of Macdonald's as a petition signing location where we can get the word out about Mumia and about Macdonald's at the same time. I love the Food not Bombs idea of distributing free food, and we will probably do that too. ..</td>

 By the way, there was a sequel series which covered the rise of Napoleon. (There was also a TV series which differs considerably from the manga series). The idea of a woman competing with men was rather an unusual idea in Japan at the time (it still is), and it's certain that Oscar had a great impact on many Japanese girls who are now adults in the workforce or raising children at home. But she's so sociable and nice that no one can dislike her. Meanwhile, in Paris, a young girl Rosalie and her more sinister sister Jeanne are growing up in the slums.</td>

 Profile's Story Profile, for us, is yet another example of failing fostering. He came to us first at the end of July, having been rehomed after a placement situation turned out poorly. We loved our goofy, silly foster boy, and toyed with the idea then of adopting him. However, we had just become Grey-Parents in March, and had just gone through having to return Henry (he tried to eat our cat. Profile was adopted in August by a very well-meaning lady and her daughter who ended up having too much going on in their personal lives so they returned him to Kim.</td>
