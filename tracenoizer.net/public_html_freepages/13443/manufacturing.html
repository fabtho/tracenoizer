 "With 500 finished goods items, the SYSTEM 2000 sales analysis tools are real handy to help us forecast and stay on top of the business. The VAI sales analysis tools allow for quick access, easy drill down, and presentation in graphs in units and dollars. The VAI sales analysis help us better anticipate what our partners want, and the manufacturing module with MRP (Materials Requirements Planning) helps reduce raw material and provide better lead times. "There is no question that VAI's SYSTEM 2000 is a good value. SYSTEM 2000 is much easier to use than our old system.</td>
