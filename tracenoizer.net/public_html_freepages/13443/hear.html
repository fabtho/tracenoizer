 He admits to indulging long solos in obscure scales, but all of his musical "excesses" are sensical and contextual. After an hour of music, the listener is neither taxed nor tired. A few tracks stand out, but it's tough to find ones that are less interesting to hear than the others. "Pig" possesses a certain charming goofiness that Vai productions occasionally use to flash a smile to the audience. Calvary," with its wailing voices and unnerving industrial flavor, border on unfathomable, but that's an anticipated part of Vai mystique.</td>
