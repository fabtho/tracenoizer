 VAI presenters including Larry Murphy, Joe Scioscia, Kevin Beasley, Claudio Gallina and Diane Brand all did a terrific job in preparing for and presenting the latest offerings. Also, thanks to all VAI employees who joined their customers at the Millennium dinner. And finally, very special thanks to Charles Germano and Dick Bains, both of whom did an outstanding job presenting IBM products and industry directions. We look forward to next years event which promises to be even more exciting. .</td>
