 With over 100 System 2000 customers and 12 third party presenters, the focus was on e-business and 21st Century technology. The event was kicked off by Bob Vormittag who provided a review of 1999 and a forecast of future product direction and new application plans. Vormittag stated, "This was the most important conference ever because our customers need these new e-business applications and versions today to compete in the new millennium. Germano provided a view of the distribution market and the changes taking place especially with e-business. VAI introduced John Avitabile from Ad Methods, a New York advertising agency and web developer.</td>

 "VAI has helped us make a big difference with order processing and customer service. Easy access to notes about customers and sales history has been an unbelievable timesaver. We process more orders today with 2 people than on our old system with 4 people. That savings alone has probably paid for SYSTEM 2000 just in the first year. "With 500 finished goods items, the SYSTEM 2000 sales analysis tools are real handy to help us forecast and stay on top of the business.</td>
