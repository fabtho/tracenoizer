 A few tracks stand out, but it's tough to find ones that are less interesting to hear than the others. "Pig" possesses a certain charming goofiness that Vai productions occasionally use to flash a smile to the audience. Calvary," with its wailing voices and unnerving industrial flavor, border on unfathomable, but that's an anticipated part of Vai mystique. By assembling a stable of high-caliber musicians to accompany his high-octane playing, Vai successfully removes himself from the pack of forgettable guitar speed demons and technique freaks from the late '80s. Dan Amrich (Ithaca College, Class of '93) freelances music critiques from his home in New Jersey, and owes everything he knows about writing to Barbara Adams.</td>
