 Gemco has approximately 70 employees and 22 users on its current system, an IBM 9406-170. It's a competitive business, so having the right system makes a big difference in being responsive to customer demands. "We looked at upgrading to the next release of MAPICS and upgrading our in-house custom program, but we found it to be three times more expensive than VAI's SYSTEM 2000. " Joe continues, "We looked at several Windows-based MRP solutions but they were out of the question because these PC-based solutions could not handle more than 10 EDI trading partners. "Not only was VAI's SYSTEM 2000 a better value than MAPICS, we felt SYSTEM 2000 sales analysis tools were much better than anything we had.</td>
