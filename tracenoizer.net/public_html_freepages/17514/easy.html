 Apart from some unofficial beta testing of Deadlock, that was the first and last project on which I worked directly with him. But later in groups, we played a few games of RoboRally and had lunch together. Paul was always a lot of fun to work around a has and casual attitude that is easy to accept. Dave now is using his talent as Senior Game Designer for Random Games. Darren provided me with some of the best links on this site.</td>

 This is an aspect of my life that is very important to me. I enjoy helping people, and it feels good to use the gifts that I have in this area. Since I am fortunate enough to have a career that provides me with a good living, it has been easy for me to never charge anyone for healing them. This is the natural balance to studying martial arts--if you learn to harm and destroy life, you must also learn to heal and save lives. I must say that although I have some substantial skill at both, I much prefer to heal.</td>
