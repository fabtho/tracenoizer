 I taught a mini-course on "Doing Business on the Internet" at XRT (2-day course) and at Cabrini College in PA. I've also taught other self-defense (including at a kids summer camp) and rape prevention classes, and given several talks at various conferences about computer-related topics. I don't do a lot of teaching, but I enjoy it occasionally. In giving what you've learned back to others, it completes the circle of life. I studied Amma (a Japanese massage style) for a couple of years, and other energy-based healing arts for a number of years.</td>

He also enjoy crafts and bugging the hell (am I allowed to say that. Chris is totally psyched to have gotten our taxes done, his GPS to work, Dazzle to run AND his tomato plants started (in our bathroom. He has been spending as much time as he can, when the weather cooperates, getting his garden ready for planting.</td>
