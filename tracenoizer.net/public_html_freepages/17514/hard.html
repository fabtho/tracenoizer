 After a few days' practice they could go up and down as gaily as buckets in a well. And how ardently they grew to love their home under the ground; especially Wendy. A Never tree tried hard to grow in the centre of the room, but every morning they sawed the trunk through, level with the floor. There was an enourmous fireplace which was in almost any part of the room where you cared to light it, and across this Wendy stretched strings, made of fibre, from which she suspended her washing. There was a strict rule against turning round until one gave the signal, when all turned at once.</td>
