 SOAP encoding is based on XML Schemas and as such it closely models many of the standard types and constructs that developers would be familiar with. . We need to know the rules for representing an integer, string, or floating point number in a SOAP message so that we can exchange messages freely between languages and platforms. The serialization of data inside a SOAP message is referred to as encoding. As this section focuses on the payload of the message, the XML in the examples represents only a SOAP message payload and not a complete message.</td>

 Workshop Overview The morning workshop presents a process that Briggs has evolved since leaving Microsoft in 1991. The workshop begins with an explanation of why you need to tell a compelling story to create awareness and demand for your product. The presentation includes a discussion about why a successful message strategy includes company vision and mission statements, along with product positioning statements. The message does not matter to the target audience Claims that fail any reasonable test of credibility Long sales cycles due to market confusion; i. , me-too marketing Confusing positioning with a description of what a product does, how it differs from the competition and why it is unique In the rare case where a company actually claims benefits, a shotgun approach is often used.</td>
