 Department of Health and Human Services This Page Has Moved This directory was created in 1994 in anticipation of the Department's usage of the Internet. In fact, the HHS Internet presence is highly decentralized, and this directory now only adds to the length of a web page's location. Please take this opportunity to change your bookmark. We are forwarding you to our Agencies web page, so you can more easily locate the organization you wish to visit. .</td>

This is because of a change-over in the servers talker. So whilst this happens the website may, or may not, loose some functionality. Sorry about this, but it should all prove to be better in the long run.</td>
