 As an engineer its almost impossible for me to understand how an intelligent treatment of a subject such as reliability engineering could be accomplished otherwise. I recommend this book without reservation, to anyone interested in this multifaceted subject. Covers, lightly, the organization of telephone networks. Dumps a great deal of math on the reader which is out of place. I would have to ask for a refund and spend the money on a telcore manual.</td>
