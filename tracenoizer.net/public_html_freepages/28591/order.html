 Some NAT routers misbehave only until an administrative password has been set; you can try to connect to it using HTTP to see if this is happening to you. . We implemented this system in order to stop the abuse of unsecured WinGates and various other unsecured and openly accessable proxies. This has more recently been expanded on with the introduction of ProxyCheck services. We have instituted these measures in order to protect our users from other people whowould use these proxies to attack and annoy the general network population and the network itself.</td>
