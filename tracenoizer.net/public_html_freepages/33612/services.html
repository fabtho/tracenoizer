 Since outsourcing projects usually entail long-term partnerships - often five years and more -, the question of a provider's "chances of survival" is just as important as the compatibility of the two company cultures. As far as the price is concerned, experience shows that both parties' expectations rarely match. Particularly im-portant in this respect are clearly defined SLAs (service level agreements) in which the scope of services, quality and re-sponsibilities are clearly defined. Ultimately, the provider whom one judges as most trustworthy should be awarded the contract. "As an IT service provider focused on outsourcing, we're all too familiar with the process of choosing a partner", reports Triaton expert Gerd Rusch.</td>
