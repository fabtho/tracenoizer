 The exhibition is curated by Andreas Broeckmann (director of transmediale) and Matthias Weiss (hartware). Software artists develop computer programs that exceed the boundaries and possibilities of conventional software or reduce their functions to absurdity. However, the artists do not see the software as a tool, but rather view the code as fundamental aesthetic material for their artistic creations. While most PC users accept the possibilities and above all the limitations of commercial software as a given, software artists demonstrate all the active and creative possibilities by developing their own independent programs. Whereby the hype surrounding the Internet, as well as, topics like simulated environments in computer games are thematically dealt with.</td>
