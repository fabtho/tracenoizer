And, as Kathleen stated, you can then more strongly demonstrate that your B phase was responsible for the change seen by returning to baseline, or in essence creating an ABA design. In group designs, the same aspect is attempted by assigning some subjects to the control group and some to the experimental group. However, in a single-subject design, you're generally looking at the change WITHIN a subject's behavior, and hence why they're often also called within-subject designs.

 An invariant is an expression which must evaluate to true whenever the entity being described is in a stable state. An invariant expression must evaluate to a boolean. An object is defined as being in a stable state when either (a) no threads of control are within the object or operating upon the object, (b) a single thread of control is about to enter a method of the object, or (c) a single thread of control is about to exit a method of the object. If an invarient is violated when an object is in a stable state, a Throwable is thrown. The execution context for a method should be described at this point.</td>

 (d) The capacity of the environment is limited, and it is the intent of the Legislature that the government of the state take immediate steps to identify any critical thresholds for the health and safety of the people of the state and take all coordinated actions necessary to prevent such thresholds being reached. (e) Every citizen has a responsibility to contribute to the preservation and enhancement of the environment. (f) The interrelationship of policies and practices in the management of natural resources and waste disposal requires systematic and concerted efforts by public and private interests to enhance environmental quality and to control environmental pollution. (c) Prevent the elimination of fish or wildlife species due to man's activities, insure that fish and wildlife populations do not drop below self- perpetuating levels, and preserve for future generations representations of all plant and animal communities and examples of the major periods of California history. (d) Ensure that the long-term protection of the environment, consistent with the provision of a decent home and suitable living environment for every Californian, shall be the guiding criterion in public decisions.</td>
