 When we think racing, it's not all motors, grease, and speed. It's about hard work, dedication, and coming together as a team. Like many things, we can associate this sport with a machine. It is here and now that I would like to offer my sincere thanks to my sponsors, fans, and the crew that gets me through each race with great dedication and offers the strength we need to go the distance. Winning is what we're all here for but the day to day passion for the sport is what makes us continue to reach for the big one.</td>
