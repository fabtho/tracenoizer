 The RCA Black Plates come next, raunchy and hot with sizzling upper mids and highs but a little muddy compared to the Visseaux and Sylvania's. These are widely considered the Holy Grail, and they really are a fantastic sounding tube. They are clearly the choice for guitarists looking for an over the top overdrive, they compress faster and breakup more than any other tube in the test, but are less articulate than the Visseaux and Sylvania. The Marconi JAN (Italian made) was a good middle-ground tube. Not as hot as the RCA, and not quite as musical and sweet as the others.</td>
