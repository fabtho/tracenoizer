 Here are the results of a very unscientific taste test I ran with a good friend recently. Your mileage may vary, but here's what we found out using our very flawed techniques. There's no reverb or tremelo in the circuit to get in the way, just pure sound. The amp is rectified by a 5Y3GT and the speaker is the stock 8" Oxford AlNico magnet speaker. The test guitar was a stock early 70's Tele, and we used a 10 foot Spectraflex cord and plugged into the amp's high impedence jack.</td>
