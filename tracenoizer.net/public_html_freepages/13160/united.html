 Additional research time is encouraged, but must be on a volunteer basis or compensated by the faculty sponsor from other sources. A grant makes funds available to purchase approved supplies and equipment (which become the property of the University) for the research project. When strongly recommended by a student's faculty research advisor, the URS Program will consider supporting a student's travel to use a unique resource collection within the continental United States. Grants may not be used to buy personal books or personal items or to pay salaries of assistants. Again, students eligible to apply for URS grants are those whose research is part of a concurrent independent study course.</td>
