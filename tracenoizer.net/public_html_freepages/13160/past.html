 The System and R2S has been key to our increased growth and profitability. The System is a total professional accounts receivable program. From the opening of an account (which usually takes less than five minutes), to the monthly billing and collection of my past due accounts, the people at R2S treat my customers with the professionalism that I demand. ..</td>

 Our research program concentrates on topics related to the prehistory, origin and early evolution of planetary systems. By means of in situ measurements, laboratory analysis and numerical modeling, we investigate our own solar systems with its small bodies (comets and asteroids), its planets and their atmospheres as well as the newly discovered exo-solar planets in order to unravel the physical processes underlying the formation and evolution of these systems. These investigations also include the past and present interaction of the Sun with magnetospheres and atmospheres with the Earth and with comets. ..</td>

 Again, students eligible to apply for URS grants are those whose research is part of a concurrent independent study course. Students who have conducted research at Duke and who have the opportunity to present their research results at a national or regional meeting of a professional organization should inquire about the availability of travel funds through the URS Program. Past experience suggests that students should submit applications within the first four weeks of the semester to ensure consideration before program funds are fully committed. Applications will not be accepted after the mid-semester break. Notification of awards will be mailed to students and faculty sponsors within two weeks of submission.</td>
