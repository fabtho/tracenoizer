 We have read these sites closely so as to find clues to sources about and by women, even when they are not highlighted by the creator of the web page. We have also chosen not to include websites that provide general descriptions of the repository, but do not provide information about the collections held. We hope this site is of help to you in your research, and we welcome feedback and additions to these pages. This site was maintained, updated, redesigned and added to by Jill Jackson from 1996-2000. htm Send questions or comments about this site to Toni Jeske, Assistant Archivist.</td>
