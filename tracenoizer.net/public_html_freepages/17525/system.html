 And that bring me to the number of trains required for the movement. It is an extremely difficult problem, as we do not know how many - er - passengers we have to handle. I realise, gentlemen, for any one system to provide 30 or 40 or 50 trains at the present time is a big problem. I suggest we now discuss it and get down to detail as soon as possible. It took 186 trains, not 150 - and they never stopped for nine and a half days; 323,000 men they took away from the ports.</td>

 .USPS National Customer Support Center - Services Address Change Service Description Address Change Service (ACS) is an electronic enhancement to traditional, manual methods of providing change-of- address (COA) information to mailers. The system is designed to reduce the volume of manual (hard copy) address correction notifications handled by both the Postal Service and mailers and to centralize and automate the provision of address correction information to mailers. Mailers add a unique code to the address area of their mailpieces to identify them as ACS participants. These records are consolidated nightly at the National Customer Support Center (NCSC) in Memphis and are provided to ACS mailers according to a frequency determined by each mailer.</td>
