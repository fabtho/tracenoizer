 This scheme will not affect the deployment of any specific long term plan, and therefore, this document will not discuss any long term plans for routing and address architectures. 1 Aggregation and its limitations One major goal of this addressing plan is to allocate Internet address space in such a manner as to allow aggregation of routing information along topological lines. Unfortunately, not all sites are singly-connected to the network, so some loss of ability to aggregate is realized for the non simple cases. There are two situations that cause a loss of aggregation efficiency. Because multi-homed organizations must be advertised into the system by each of their service providers, it is often not feasible to aggregate their routing information into the address space any one of those providers.</td>
