 The 4 L's of Parenting From birth to 7LOVE THEM From 7 to 14LIMIT THEM From 14 to 21LISTEN TO THEM From 21 on. A simple easy-to-use program that is loved by parents, children and teachers alike. com If you have a young family, and you don't currently hold regular Family Nights, then starting them might be a little easier for you, as young children usually don't have a problem with playing a game and having a snack with mom and day. If your children are mostly in their teen years, you may find a little more resistance, but if you are determined to make this work for your family, you can accomplish this. Just remember, the overall idea is to have this one night set each week that everyone in your family will know to be family night.</td>
