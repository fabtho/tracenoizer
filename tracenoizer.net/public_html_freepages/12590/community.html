 Josh Riggle, a fifth-grader at Northwest Elementary School, was helping his teacher carry supplies to another room when he found out from the school principal that his story had been chosen for the stage. The Chicago company visited Huntington County schools last fall, putting on short performances and explaining what they were looking for in new stories. Three schools elected to participate, said Margaret Roush, director of the community fine arts program at the Merillat Centre for the Arts. Newsome learned of her selection at the same time as the rest of the school. To reserve tickets, call the Huntington College box office at 359-4261.</td>

 And I think of it in winter time when snow drifts against the tombstones. I can hear the warm south wind moaning there on summer nights.
