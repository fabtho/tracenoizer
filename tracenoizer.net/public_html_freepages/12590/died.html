 There are many records abstracted, and perhaps I overlooked it. There are supposed to be deeds or a deed between John Cockerell and a husband of his supposed Presley sistier-in-law, but I don't know if these deeds prove the relationship or not. 123 states that Elizabeth Presley Cockerill died (April-May) 1719, and Peter Presley Jr. 19, 1718) doesn't name her, only his two sisters Mary and Ursula. However, his sister Jane Presley Rodgers Neale is proved, and she is omitted from Peter Presley's will.</td>
