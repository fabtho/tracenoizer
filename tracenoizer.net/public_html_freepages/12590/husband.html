She and her husband John moved with their six children to Australia in 1975. When the grandchildren started arriving, Barbara began storytelling. Now with 11 grandchildren and most of the family living in and around Brisbane, she finds time to put the stories to paper.</td>

 The names Presly, Peter, Ursula, are all handed down in the Cockerill family. There are many records abstracted, and perhaps I overlooked it. There are supposed to be deeds or a deed between John Cockerell and a husband of his supposed Presley sistier-in-law, but I don't know if these deeds prove the relationship or not. 123 states that Elizabeth Presley Cockerill died (April-May) 1719, and Peter Presley Jr. 19, 1718) doesn't name her, only his two sisters Mary and Ursula.</td>
