 Furthermore, the Dust Bowl and Great Depression were recent enough for roast on an ordinary day to be cause for celebration. And, our two roomed apartment was in sight of the Gulf of Mexico. My mother and I loved to walk on the beach, looking for sand dollars, building sand castles. But on that sweltering July morning, it was enough to get out of the apartment while the roast cooked slowly, to tender perfection. A little while later, I was wading happily in the surf while Mama daydreamed in the seawall's shade.</td>

 Presly and Peter Presly, the father, and donor of the hereby granted land to the sd. John Cockrill, is a sister of Jane Presley Rogers Neale, but apparently this has been interpretation of several researchers. )Saunders Cockrill from his father Edward Sanders and mother Mary Webb Hudnall Saunders Thomas, or why else would they be named and their relationships given such detail. Of course, there are many associations with their relatives, and the same family names are handed down, so certainly the Saunders and Cockrill families were close friends of the Presleys if they were not related as the books say. I would think that if she has a theory, it is likely the best theory, and I am not in a position to second-guess any opinion she might have.</td>
