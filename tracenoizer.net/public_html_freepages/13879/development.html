 When you buy a video camera or something like that, it comes with a serial cable or usb connection. There are enough reasons to be able to run windows. My primary development system is definitely linux, my desktop is linux and all the server machine at Zope corporation are linux. 2, but we've done it in a way that it's totally backwards compatible, no old code is broken by the new feature. What we want to do over the next few years and the next couple of releases is to get the user communauty to start using the new features that replace old features.</td>
