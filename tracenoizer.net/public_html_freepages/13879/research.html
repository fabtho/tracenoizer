 He is listed in Marquis' Who's Who in the World 1999 and Who's Who in Science and Engineering 2000-2001. . The Numerical Fracture Mechanics Corner The Numerical Fracture Mechanics Corner The Numerical Fracture Mechanics Corner is meant to give a synopsis of the fracture research conducted within the numerical fracture mechanics group at MTU (MTU Aero Engines designs and manufactures aircraft engine components and belongs to the DaimlerChrysler company). Furthermore, by providing links to other important fracture research centers it hopefully yields a small contribution to the integration and further development of the field. Even kids realize the importance of fracture mechanics.</td>

 To make this large collection more accessible to scholars, each item has been classified under one of thirty-one sub-collections, each with its own Library of Congress subject heading (subject headings). Collection-level bibliographic records for the Guido Mazzoni Pamphlet Collection and the thirty-one subject areas are also located in the Duke Libraries online catalog. For more in-depth research, interested scholars may wish to consult an item-level database, which contains a brief bibliographic record for each pamphlet in the collection. Exhibits have also played an important role in the efforts to enhance access to the Mazzoni Collection. A new, expanded on-line version of this exhibit now makes this extraordinarily rich Italian collection come alive for visitors to this web site.</td>
