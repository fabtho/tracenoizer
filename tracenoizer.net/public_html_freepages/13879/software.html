 The FSF also helps to spread awareness of the ethical and political issues of freedom in the use of software. . FSF President and founder, Richard Stallman, presented the award to Guido van Rossum for inventing and implementing as Free Software the Python programming language. The award ceremony was hosted at the Free and Open Source Software Developers' Meeting (FOSDEM) in collaboration with the Free Software Foundation Europe. A committee of Free Software pioneers and leaders selected the winner and two other finalists from the scores of mostly volunteer programmers worldwide who dedicate their time to advancing Free Software.</td>
