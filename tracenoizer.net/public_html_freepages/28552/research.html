 When growing scab resistant cultivars, fungicides are either not applied or their applications are reduced. As a result, control of summer diseases has become a major consideration on these cultivars. Larson Research Center at Rock Springs on an acre of scab-resistant apple cultivars which was established in 1992. Our primary research objective has been to determine the commercial potential of scab resistant apple cultivars and develop an optimum disease management program that will produce high quality fruit and reduce disease to economic levels with a minimum in pesticide applications. For information on our research findings please refer to the publications.</td>

 They will interpret past events and issues within the context in which an event unfolded rather than solely in terms of present day norms and values.

Students will use a variety of maps and documents to understand causes and effects of human movement including migration, war, diffusion of ideas and technology, settlement patterns and trade.</td>
