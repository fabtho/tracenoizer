 . A representative sample of welfare recipients throughout an entire California county are surveyed in the Spring of 2001, as they apply for federal Temporary Aid to Needy Families (TANF, formerly Aid to Families with Dependent Children) and locally-funded General Assistance (GA). The objective is to test important new hypotheses raised by welfare reform concerning how key program changes are affecting clients with alcohol and drug problems, and changing their prospects for economic mobility and addiction recovery. The project uses event history analysis to study the relationships between alcohol and drug problems and cycles of welfare dependency. It examines alcohol's role in the circumstances surrounding particular welfare exit and re-entry events, including how these events can serve as predictors of subsequent welfare returns.</td>

 For whatever reason, either due to bus contention, or the INTEL chipset (the 82801-82840 series) having difficulties, a thread return (a thread delete then re-open) seems to be being accessed by the wrong CPU at which point a massive bus error happens and the crash occurs. You can see how such a thing happening in a WORKSTATION would be of grave concern to anyone using such a system in any critical avenue. I wonder after seeing how I have been treated by them since I first reported these problems in OCTOBER 2000. Now why when media player opens so many copies of itself as separate threads is not known by me. If the basic audio drivers are doing this, then the problem would seem to be there one would assume.</td>
