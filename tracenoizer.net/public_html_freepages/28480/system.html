 . The EPA designed and fabricated the DSS systems to evaluate and understand the dynamics which influence water quality within water distribution infrastructure systems in the United States and abroad. The first distribution system simulator (DSS-1) has continuous flow conditions. There are six individual 75 ft (25 meter) lengths of 6 in (15 cm) diameter ductile iron pipe arranged into "pipe loop" configurations to simulate a distribution system. DSS-1 is equipped with two 1500 gallon reservoir tanks to simulate a comprehensive distribution infrastructure system.</td>

This is a dual processor system running windows 2K. and Yes, I have experienced dual processor problems - dealing with multi-media failures. (1 gig ram, dual 933 xenons) I have not been able to get DELL to repair the problems since OCTOBER of 2000 (that's 4 MONTHS LAG on a 4hr service contract).</td>

 It could even be the frame that holds the case together. I think I will try LINUX just to try to narrow down if it is some sort of MS issue. I've tried NT, and 98SE on the system to see what's up and I've seen the problem appear whenever two processors are being used. Obviously in 98SE the crashed didn't happen since 98SE only can use one processor. By the way, 98SE in single processor mode also during graphics benchmarking BEAT the pants off win2K dual processor mode.</td>
