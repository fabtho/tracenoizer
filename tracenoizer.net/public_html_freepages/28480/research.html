 0) will be used to provide guidance on how to maintain a high level of water quality during distribution. A secondary objective to this project is to develop, evaluate, and demonstrate real time monitoring of water quality parameters within distribution systems using remote telemetry . Results from research will be used to provide guidance on how to utilize remote monitoring of water quality to detect changes in water quality within distribution systems. Although these distribution systems provide drinking water to the world, very little is known about the physical, chemical, and biological activities that occur within them. Some of these water distribution systems have been in service well over one hundred years.</td>
