 "SAP has the advantage of understanding how quickly the market has evolved from a technology play into an applications game. " One of the tasks of the new unit will be to better incorporate its technology into the rest of SAP's product line. It will also focus on making SAP applications communicate better with non-SAP software and enable customers to link many different computing systems. Agassi's promotion is a signal that the company is committed to the new applications it introduced during the dot-com heyday, said Laurie Orlov, an analyst at Forrester Research. The last time it did was last year when it added new Chief Financial Officer Werner Brandt to the board.</td>

 I've tried a different OS, to verify it wasn't the OS. With windows NT OS running on this ws, I've seen similar problems - so it seems to me that the basic issues will come down to the CHIPS which Dell used to build up the motherboard. It may be that the same chip issues exist in other systems built. I believe the only way will be for users to try the test files and see if their system fails or exhibits anamolous behaviour.
