 What makes the door swing open is the fulcrum of the word. Here we learn that a task for multimedia is not the simulacrum of the moving image but the renewal of literature, a language through whose gaps the light gets in. After spending 4 years for generating moving images on video tape, I had felt frustration with the computer images, because the image was generated with 3D data but we can not touch that 3D object. I had had strong desire to materialize the object which is from computer data, for touching the surface. The results were shown as computer generated sculpture in 1987 titled Geometric Love, NC milling machine was used for realization and in 1990 titled Forbidden Fruits, Stereo lithography technology was used.</td>
