 EDC students designed a prosthesis to allow her to play tennis again. Engineering Design and Communication (EDC) is a two-quarter sequence of courses for first-year engineering students in Northwestern University's McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science. Students work in teams to solve real problems for real clients, designing solutions that range from websites to wheelchairs. EDC students designed a prosthesis to allow her to play tennis again. ) Part of McCormick's Engineering First program, EDC teaches students how to design effectively in response to real-world problems, and communicate effectively as part of the design process.</td>

 Coombs Computing, as part of its commitment to this process, is cooperating with the Government of Vietnam initiative on Information Technology and Vietnam's Institute for Information Technology. The Australia Vietnam Science-Technology Link is particularly interested in the environment and appropriate technology. We assist Vietnamese scientists find their own solutions to development problems. We are also concerned with the enormous task of saving Vietnam's environment. We know that conservation is not fencing in forests or jailing poachers.</td>

 The dramatic increase in the number and size of distributed networks of workstations in recent years has created a tremendous demand for more, and better trained, systems administrators. Understanding of the profession of systems administration on the part of employers, however, has not kept pace with the growth in the number of systems administrators or with the growth in complexity of system administration tasks. Both at sites with a long history of using computing resources and at sites into which computers have only recently been introduced, systems administrators face perception problems that present serious obstacles to their successfully carrying out their duties. In general, systems administrators enable people to exploit computers at a level which gains leverage for the entire organization. Employers frequently fail to understand the background that systems administrators bring to their task.</td>
