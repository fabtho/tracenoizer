 Equally problematic is that they have difficulty determining the credibility of the information they do find. These web sites have been selected from thousands of sites about children, based primarily on the quality of the information provided. The goal of the WebGuide is to give the public easy access to the best child development information on the Web. The Eliot-Pearson Department has a 75 year history of studying, teaching and fostering the well being of children. The Tisch Library participates in the educational and research programs of Arts, Sciences and Technology at Tufts University by facilitating access to relevant information.</td>

To address the problem of retention, YES emphasizes networking among peer students and mentorship between students and professionals already established in the field. Mentorship is recognized as a necessary component in professional development (Gibbons, 1992; White, 1970) and acknowledged as a critical component of development progr;ams for gifted and talented students (Beck, 1989). The importance of a peer support group is also widely noted (Council of Ontario Universities, 1988; American Association of University Women, 1992). The YES program and 20 participants during its first year (1993-1994) and presently 22 students are enrolled for the current academic year (1994-1995).</td>
