 GPS Research - University of Texas Center for Space Research - . As part of the College of Engineering section, the group gave a series of talks and demonstrations on the subject "Navigating With Satellites". Participants were treated to a hands-on demonstration of Global Positioning System technology and research. The talk was geared toward high school students interested in pursuing engineering fields in college. As representatives of the MITE (Minorities Introduction To Engineering) and NexTech (Young Technology Leaders) programs, these students were given the opportunity to hear an explanation of GPS from grad students Tifanie Smart and Greg Holt.</td>
