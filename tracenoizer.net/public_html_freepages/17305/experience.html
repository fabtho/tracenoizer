 Alireza will receive the award on November 6 at the AVS 49th International Symposium in Denver. Alireza is a graduate research assistant in the MEMS Sensors and Actuators Lab. Our design for the SHOP2 planning algorithm was based on the theories of planning that we developed as a result of our experience with application domains such as automated process planning, the game of bridge, and noncombatant evacuation planning.
