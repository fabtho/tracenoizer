<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" To achieve our goal, we need to understand the molecular mechanisms by which plants resist the detrimental effects of high temperatures and dehydration. Knowledge of the mechanisms will aid in devising molecular and other strategies for enhancing the ability of targeted species to cope with these stresses. Our research group has selected maize (corn) as a model system. We have identified an extremely drought and heat resistant line of maize that synthesizes unusual proteins. We have obtained genetic evidence that these proteins are important to the plant's drought and heat resistance.">

 He has obtained his Diplom Engineer degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Faculty of Technical Sciences at the University of Maribor, Slovenia, in 1987. Upon his graduation he has taken the post of the young researcher at the same faculty. In 1989 he visited Berkeley Nuclear Laboratories, Berkeley, UK, on a three month scientific and research leave where he worked under supervision of Prof. Hellen on development and application of modern advanced engineering computational methods. degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Faculty of Technical Sciences at the University of Maribor, Slovenia, for successful competion of M.</td>

 During my student days at Concordia I worked in microelectronics laboratory on many very interesting projects with very nice people. Since June 1999 I have been working for Trex Medical Inc. My work is in research and development of X-ray equipment for cardiovascular imaging. If you want to see something about what I am doing there click here. In addition to my everyday job, since fall 1997 I was a part time master degree student in electrical engineering.</td>
