 CID arrays offer considerable promise in many applications due to the focal plane architecture that allows random pixel access and non-destructive readout. These features provide for the possibility of new sampling techniques to reduce effective read noise added to the latent image by the on chip electronics. In addition to improving presently available devices, the development of next generation imaging arrays is also proceeding. Such devices, often referred to as Active Pixel Sensor (APS) arrays, promise considerable flexibility in read-out and on-chip processing for the future. 2) Robotic Astronomy - Automated observatories located in remote locations are of increasing interest in programs of routine repetitive observations of portions of the night sky, such as in searches for earth orbit crossing asteroids and comets.</td>

 These mechanisms include cell-cell recognition and taret-dependent induction of the presynaptic secretion machinery. Our studies investigate synapse formation of identified motoneurons following nerve injury in vivo and following isolation of neurons into cell culture. Since the synapse is the site of most interneuronal communication within the nervous system, an understanding of the development, regeneration and plasticity of these connections is crucial to an ultimate appreciation of neural integration and brain function. In our studies of synaptic specificity, we take advantage of the accessibility of neurons within the buccal nervous system of the American pond snail, Helisoma trivolvis. The central focus of my research program investigates the role of target-recognition and synaptic induction in the formation of neuromuscular synapses.</td>

 During my student days at Concordia I worked in microelectronics laboratory on many very interesting projects with very nice people. Since June 1999 I have been working for Trex Medical Inc. My work is in research and development of X-ray equipment for cardiovascular imaging. If you want to see something about what I am doing there click here. In addition to my everyday job, since fall 1997 I was a part time master degree student in electrical engineering.</td>
