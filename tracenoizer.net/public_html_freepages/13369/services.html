 . Announcement The 5th NKOS Workshop will be held in conjunction with the Joint Conference on Digital Libraries, July 18th, Portland, Oregon. This workshop will focus on work-in-progress on gazetteer services and gazetteer-related projects in connection with distributed digital library services. Digital gazetteers are specialized knowledge organization systems (KOS) that map placenames and types of places to map-based locations and thus integrate word-based georeferencing to map-based georeferencing. You may register for the workshop at the conference website also.</td>
