 The table at the left provides a quick, powerful source of automatic math operations. Use it to study math operations and to do online math. These problems provide the background in problem solving needed to solve problems reliably in more advanced courses. They provide the edge needed to excel in all courses and tests involving use of mathematics in problem solving at the elementary, high school and university levels. Break the problem solving barrier and make Story Problems fun and a constructive learning experience by moving past pretend-a-math.</td>

 . The problems are classified into grade levels from Grade 5 to Grade 12. THIS IS NOT A TEST, but a set of carefully selected problems which can help you improve your problem solving skills -if you try to carefully think about how you would solve each problem, and once you have found the solution, you make sure that you understand all parts of the solution. You can try any problem you like and if the problem is a little difficult you can get helpful hints by following the hints link.
