 Petersburg, and Yuri Matiyasevich's book Hilbert's Tenth Problem. .Mathematical Problems of David Hilbert The Mathematical Problems of David Hilbert About Hilbert's address and his 23 mathematical problems Hilbert's address of 1900 to the International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris is perhaps the most influential speech ever given to mathematicians, given by a mathematician, or given about mathematics. In it, Hilbert outlined 23 major mathematical problems to be studied in the coming century. Some are broad, such as the axiomatization of physics (problem 6) and might never be considered completed.</td>
