 It's best to check with students who have recently returned from study in the country of interest, with advisers at the International Center, with your study abroad program administrators, and with the country's consulate. These prestigious awards and the contacts they open up have often been stepping-stones to international careers. Direct enrollment in a foreign university is another post-graduate possibility. Student status may allow you to work part-time or during vacations, but some countries (e. Britain, Ireland, France) will either not allow students to work, or students must petition local authorities to do so with the assistance of their host university.</td>
