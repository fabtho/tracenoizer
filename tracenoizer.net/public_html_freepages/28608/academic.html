<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" Rick Lynch is a renowned trainer, author and management consultant based in Seattle who serves as a CASA board member. He is experienced in volunteer management, was the training director of the Washington State Office of Voluntary Action, and he features as a speaker at hundreds of conferences and workshops each year in Europe and North America. This seminar is aimed at policy makers in public, academic and voluntary sector organisations and at managers of volunteers. The topical seminar is a timely look at US experience when our own welfare of children and the systems for their support and protection are under intense scrutiny. Are there lessons that our much criticised child care and associated professions can learn from involving trained volunteers, as CASA has done.">

 send a question What happens to my paper's copyright when it appears in Education-line. Education-line asks for your permission to display the work on the internet. If another party (such as an academic publisher, College or Learned Society) owns the copyright, you need to secure their permission for its appearance in Education-line. In either case, the copyright remains with the original owner. Further exploitation of the work by the copyright holder can therefore take place without reference back to Education-line.</td>

 For those interested in working abroad, the study abroad situation can also provide a secure base from which to explore job possibilities and make contacts with potential employers. Credit towards your degree is available as long as you check with the proper offices before going. If you don't need the academic credit towards a degree (if you are graduating, for example), study abroad might simply be impractical. U-M students who receive financial aid may apply it towards U-M study abroad programs. Scholarships for undergraduate study abroad are fairly rare.</td>
