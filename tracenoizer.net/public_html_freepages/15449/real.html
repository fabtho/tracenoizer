 Then, see if you can come up with your OWN cartoon based on that bird. . Do you think cartoon birds are like any real birds. They are all based on birds that exist somewhere in the world. Even the behaviors of some of these cartoon birds are based on the real things.</td>

 . One evening at the Ink and Paint Club, Disney's Donald Duck and Warners' Daffy Duck engage in a memorable piano duet. So, is this the real McCoy, or just another case of the power of suggestion influencing us to hear ordinary dialog as something else. (See the pages about the film Aladdin and The Lion King talking toy for similar examples. ) At first listen, it's easy to hear what we're told to hear, "god damn stupid nigger.</td>

 Jansen Flower and Gift Gallery-Walt Disney Collection. htm One night in 1938, Roy Disney was in bed with the chicken pox when his Uncle Walt stopped by to say hello. They got to chatting, and Uncle Walt ended up telling him the whole story of Pinocchio, the wooden puppet who dreamed of being a real boy. The story, of course, became a Disney film classic, and the memory of that night has stayed with Roy all these years - because that's what our most cherished memories do. But what if we could hold those memories in our hand .</td>
