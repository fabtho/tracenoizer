 King of the Klondike King of the Klondike was not only the eighth episode of his "Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck" masterpiece, it was also the first of Don's stories to have a One and Three part version. Interestingly, with the exception of the text boxes in the European versions, The art for the three and single part versions is exactly the same, unlike all the other multi-part stories. The Empire-Builder From Calisota The Empire-Builder From Calisota was the first real single and multi-part story. That's right, the art for the two versions is completely different. We would show you the original American scans, but unfortunately Tristan's scanner broke.</td>

 Jansen Flower and Gift Gallery-Walt Disney Collection. htm One night in 1938, Roy Disney was in bed with the chicken pox when his Uncle Walt stopped by to say hello. They got to chatting, and Uncle Walt ended up telling him the whole story of Pinocchio, the wooden puppet who dreamed of being a real boy. The story, of course, became a Disney film classic, and the memory of that night has stayed with Roy all these years - because that's what our most cherished memories do. But what if we could hold those memories in our hand .</td>

 (The publisher once claimed one in four Norwegians reads Donald Duck every week. When the DD ban was proposed, we received a million (I counted) clippings from various newspapers read by our friends who were delighted to find something with which to give him a little garbage. ) In any case, my ex- ended up calling his mother in Kuopio, and asking her to clip and send any Finnish news articles that she could find relating to the story. The proposed ban was real, but the motivations were political in some murky Northern sort of way. It was never intended to be taken seriously; someone was trying to make a point.</td>
