 As host of Morning Edition, National Public Radio's signature a. " Edwards has been at the helm of Morning Edition since its premiere 20 years ago, when he was co-hosting All Things Considered with Susan Stamberg. When Morning Edition's highly touted pilot show faltered, Edwards was recruited to fill in for 30 days. Thirty days will have become two decades this fall when Morning Edition celebrates its anniversary, along the way becoming NPR's most-listened-to program. The hallmark of Morning Edition is its focus on thoughtful analysis of events rather than the race to break the big story.</td>

 The route for an official attempt on the round-the-world record is eastabout from a start-finish line between England's Lizard Point and Ushant in France, leaving all the Capes to the left. British yachtswoman Edwards is preparing for a second attempt at the Jules Verne trophy next winter after her 1998 all-female bid ended in disaster. Edwards and her crew on Royal and Sun Alliance were dismasted in the Southern Ocean while trying to better Frenchman Olivier de Kersauson's time of 71 days 14 hours set in 1997. Four years later - and having acquired Dalton's 110-foot catamaran Club Med - Edwards believes the New Zealander's mark is also under threat.
