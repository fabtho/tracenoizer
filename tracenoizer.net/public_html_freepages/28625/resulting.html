 If home schooling is an issue, we will represent our member families until the issue is resolved. On Fourth Amendment unreasonable search and seizure issues, HSLDA will assist and advise our members whenever the privacy of their home is violated by forced or coerced entry for the purpose of an unsubstantiated investigation. HSLDA membership benefits do not extend to court actions resulting from non-home schooling matters. By the creation of these forms, HSLDA did not intend to burden its members with more paperwork. Rather, the forms are designed for the convenience of our members and to protect them from inadvertently giving more information than their state's law requires.</td>
