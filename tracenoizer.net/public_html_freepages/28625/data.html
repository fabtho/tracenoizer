 Space Physics Data Availability Overview of SPDS What's new with SPDS. . The SPDS is was initiated in 1994 by NASA's former Space Physics Division to preserve historical data and provide improved access to space physics data. The SPDS is a distributed system whose services are existing data systems serving the disciplines of space physics, Cosmic and Heliospheric Physics Ionospheric, Thermospheric and Mesospheric Physics Magnetospheric Physics Solar Physics Multi-Disciplinary Services Other Related Services plus individuals from the science community who are interested in data related issues. The SPDS is still taking shape and will continue to evolve.</td>

 This Introduction to Small Bodies provides general information about the objects we study, geared for the non-specialist. . The Small Bodies Node (SBN) specializes in data concerning asteroids, comets and interplanetary dust. Data Services at this Node SBN on-line data archives, with immediately downloadable catalogs and datasets for New. The SBDB will eventually allow users to identify objects based on observed properties and to retrieve data relevant to specific selected objects.</td>
