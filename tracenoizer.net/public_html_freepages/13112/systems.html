The security vulnerability -- affecting Windows 95, Windows 98, the Sun Microsystems and Solaris operating systems -- involves what's known as the ICMP Internet Router Discovery Protocol (IRDP), which determines the route computers use to connect to the Internet.

 A number of Stats users are also providing further assistance by being members of the User Validation Panel for the AIMS software. The AIMS core module will be made available free of charge to all Stats users who are still subscribers at the time of launch. However, because the two systems are almost 10 years apart in database technology we do not intend to offer an upgrade facility from Stats to AIMS. We hope that all our Stats users will take the opportunity of moving over to the new system when available. Lasa will continue to offer support to Stats users for a period after the launch of the AIMS software.</td>
