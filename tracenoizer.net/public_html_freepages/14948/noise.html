Buyers are confused by too many similar choices from too many similar vendors. With all the marketing noise, we've learned not to listen. For many of us, buying decisions are influenced not by advertising, but by referrals and word-of-mouth. And word-of-mouth referrals don't come from big advertising budgets--they come from understanding how to get the attention of the customer you want to help.">

I know I have disappeared and may have disappointed quite a few people out there and I sincerely apologize; but due to a job change and a huge move that took me to Japan, I have not been able to concentrate on noise. The English teaching job that I have, has really transferred me around Western Japan, but I have now been permanently and securely stationed at a nice industrial city in the Northern Kyushu area. I would like to thank Mikko for the opportunity, the great format, an ass kicking CD and killer layout.</td>
