<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" But Wrestling has given me so much more than the financial rewards that go along with a 10-year career. It has been about the love I have had and continue to have for Pro Wrestling, which I consider to be the greatest business in the world, and a great privilege to be a part of. It has given me more than I deserve, and not only for the 10 years I have been actively wrestling, but for the 26 years I have been watching, and for the past 18 years since I first decided that it was wrestling that I wanted to do for a living. And to this day, Wrestling gives more to me than I could ever possibly give back to it. Newsboards may post the above with a link to ChrisKanyon.">

 Even with his A in the wine class, Springer wouldn't have made it to the salutatorian's post without dropping the grades he received for high school classes he took in middle school. This is allowed at Spanish River only for calculation of valedictorian and salutatorian. Over the past few years, McKee watched as grades from high school courses taken in middle school brought down the averages of students from public middle schools. Students from private middle schools, like Shelling and Church, were not affected because their earlier grades don't count toward their averages. The state says all high school-level and college-level courses taken at public schools must be included in a high school transcript.</td>
