 There are still a number of WWF superstars that have yet to be drafted, so it looks like we'll just have to wait and see. It has been 10 years, to the day, of my first match. In Levitown, Long Island, at Island Trees Junior High School in front of about 350 fans, Chris Kanyon (actually called Chris Morgan for this match only) was having his first match. It has been an unbelievable and tremendously rewarding ride. Yeah, I have a pretty nice house with a great backyard, playfully called "Klub Kanyon" by some people.</td>
