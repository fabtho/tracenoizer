<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" The award, made for the first time in 1999, recognises outstanding achievement in British universities during the past 12 months. The award is not decided solely on a university's position in our league table (or Cambridge would win every year) but is designed to recognise excellence, with teaching quality to the fore. More than anything else, this determines the academic experience of students at university. Backed by superb all-round strength, Newcastle is our choice because of its outstanding teaching record in medicine and related subjects - a perfect example of academic excellence addressing national need. It is crowned by the university's designation as the learning and teaching support centre for all UK medical schools, to disseminate best teaching practice - in a year when a surprising number of university medical schools have missed out on the highest teaching ratings, signalling excellence under our criteria.">

 Thomas Tweed, professor of religious studies, serves as co-director of a team of researchers using GIS to map religions in North America. The Electronic Cultural Atlas Initiative, based at the University of California at Berkeley, brings together international religious studies researchers to make new maps of religious and cultural history. Tweed predicted that eventually teachers could show students an animated map, for example, of Methodist churches as they expanded across the United States during the 19th century. "Non-believers will need a conversion experience," Tweed said. Russ Van Wyk, history lecturer, underwent his conversion experience at an academic conference.</td>
