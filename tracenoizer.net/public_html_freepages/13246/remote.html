 . In particular, the treatment of different image data sets in multiple combinations with optimum degree of geometric accuracy is required for the exact geographic location of individual ground features, especially in mountainous regions. Moreover, multisensor remote sensing data have to be made available to be used in geographic information systems or environmental monitoring systems. Hence, based on many years of research in the field of remote sensing, the Institute for Digital Image Processing of JOANNEUM RESEARCH has developed RSG - the Remote Sensing software package Graz. The RSG software package is designed as comprehensive and versatile as possible for geometric processing and quality assessment of digital multisensor remote sensing data.</td>

 . Both of these processes are climatically determined, so that measurements of the mass balance of glaciers can provide an important tool for high-latitude climate monitoring. The Scott Polar Research Institute's use of remote sensing methods in glaciology began in 1963 with the development of the first radio echo-sounding (RES) equipment for the measurement of ice thickness. RES is a radio-frequency (VHF or UHF) technique, depending on the transparency of ice at these frequencies, normally operated from the ice surface or from an airborne platform. In 1967 a joint programme of airborne radio echo-sounding of the Antarctic ice sheet was begun by SPRI and the US National Science Foundation, culminating in the publication in 1983 of the Antarctic Folio which contains a detailed description of about half of the ice sheet of east Antarctica.</td>
