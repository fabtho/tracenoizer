<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" Technical committees have been established to cover four technical strands - Subsurface, Seabed, Environment and Metocean - and to define and recommend projects for execution. The technical committees comprise representatives from selected exploration companies and the Petroleum Affairs Division (PAD), but may also draw on outside expertise from time to time. In excess of 60 proposals have been received from a broad spectrum of research organisations and companies and detailed reviews of existing data have been initiated. Work carried out by the RSG will be additional to normal licence - specific work programmes and will be screened to avoid duplication of effort across national or international boundaries. Co-operation with other joint industry and research groupings will be promoted, particularly those focusing on the Atlantic margin frontier area.">

 The group also designs proprietary, Windows-based software to enable end-users to access and manipulate ISI publication and citation data with maximum power and flexibility. . The data provided by the Research Services Group is based on the bibliographic and citation information that ISI collects from its multidisciplinary database of thousands of influential, peer-reviewed journals. The Research Services Group maintains a file of publication and citation data spanning 1981 to 1999 that is specially structured in a relational database format for bibliometric analysis. It is multidisciplinary in scope and exhaustive in coverage of bibliographic information and citation counts (essential measures of research influence and impact).</td>
