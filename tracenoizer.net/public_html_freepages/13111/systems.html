 Leaving your PSION unattended for two minutes is enough. It is possible to protect your machine against this form of attack, but as a description of the way how to do this would also be a description of how to attack the machine, Ralf decided to keep this information under disclosure. He is in close contact with PSION Germany, and the people there are very interested in the method of the attack, and they will definitely be looking for a way to protect the systems against it. In the meantime, PsionWelt strongly recommends to encrypt ALL sensible data on your machine, on the CF as well as on the internal drive. The security hole does NOT depend on the language, so the hack also works for all international versions of the Series5.</td>

I am also still looking for anecdotes and experiences you may have had in testing dirty systems. If selected for the book, we will give you credit, but sorry, no pay. Your goal is to plan and perform a test that is more than just guesswork.</td>
