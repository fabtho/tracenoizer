 I had a great time with it, and certainly benefited from the notoriety it gave me; but eventually I didn't have time to maintain it well. Like most people in that position, it took me years to admit it and even more time to come up with a reasonable solution. I could have searched for a new maintainer, but there was no guarantee that the new person would find the task any less overwhelming in the long run. I realized that the best solution was a collaborative system, allowing any interested party to become a contributor to the document. Downloading the Components For your convenience, you can right-click the following links and choose "save link as" in order to pick up a copy of the current "web browsers OpenFAQ," which you can use as a starting point for your own OpenFAQ system.</td>

 Squid's configure does not use -lmalloc on Solaris. DNS lookups can be slow because of some mysterious thing called ncsd. You may notice something similar if you run a log processor executing many DNS resolver queries - the resolver starts to slow. conf file determines the order of searches for lookups (amongst other things). You might only have it set up to allow NIS and HOSTS files to work.</td>

 Can NcFTPd password database users have their password expire. No; the databases were designed to be read-only by the ncftpd processes. If you want daily logs but only want to keep a few days worth of logs, you can write a short shell script to remove old log files and have it run from cron. NcFTPd is displaying directory listings with the wrong timezone. To fix this, write a small script which sets the timezone to what you want, and then runs NcFTPd.</td>
