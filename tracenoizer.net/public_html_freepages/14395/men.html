 Charlie left the shipyard for good in 1956 to go to the half complete East Yelland Power Station where he was seconded to Parsons to assist with the completion of the remaining turbines. In 1960 he transferred to the training school which had been set up in 1957 by Tom Godfrey who was at that time the sole instructor. Charlie enjoyed his work at the school immensely, feeling (justifiably) that he had helped many young men to a good start in their working lives. Charlie retired when the school closed in 1982 and has traveled extensively with Madge, they have been to America, Canada and most of Europe. He realised a dream when he took Madge to Vancouver, he'd always wanted to take her there since first visiting it all those years ago whilst in the Merchant Navy.</td>
