 The one thing she never aspired to was being a writer, although she devoured books as a child as though they were delicious candy. It all happened so suddenly, she still can't believe that over 72 of her historical romances have been published. Cassie has won ROMANTIC TIMES 'Lifetime Achievement Award' for her Indian series and a 'Reviewer's Choice Award' for her first Indian romance, SAVAGE OBSESSION. Cassie lives in Mattoon, Illinois, with her husband Charlie and she and Charlie have two grown sons. For those of you who collect Cassie's books and want to know more about her backlist and future books you can write to her at her address that appears at the back of each of her books.</td>

 But now having the Space Station in orbit all the time means there can be many more radio calls with the astronauts. Hams on Earth can get calls from the Station crew in between their work tasks and meals. The astronauts set dates and times for contacts with schools, and they also make or receive calls almost any time with earth-bound hams. So far they have talked with thousands of hams around the world. .</td>
