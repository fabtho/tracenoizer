 We did wake up early but it was because of raindrops. The rain didn't last though and the sun eventually shone down on the rock, baking the climbers who had started their day early, when it was chillier. This being The Valley at the beginning of the good climbing season, we had to wait to start the climbs. Bishop's Terrace was straightforward, mostly crack climbing. We went the little extra bit up onto the terrace proper from which we enjoyed the view for a while before rappeling back down.</td>

 The victory helps the Sounders finish a five match A-League road trip, plus one US Open Cup Tournament road match, with a 2-4 record. Seattle were able to battle back after Minnesota scored first. Forward Corey Woodfolk got his first goal of the season in the 17th minute on an assist from midfielder Paul Nowak. Two newcomers to the starting lineup contributed to the Sounders first goal, which tied the score at 1-1. Midfielder Scott Bower, who joined Seattle on a one match loan from the San Jose Earthquakes, assisted on Jeremy Sweet's first goal as a Sounder in the 20th minute.</td>
