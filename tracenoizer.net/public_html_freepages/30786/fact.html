The results are really "international" (see below), but it was a great pleasure the the BIS title was finally given to a Hungarian schnauzer. The first "HSPK Jahressieger" can be considered a milestone, since there was a great interest from Hungary and abroad against the fact, that CAC title was not given to the class winners. We feel that the Hungarian Jahressieger title was valued as high as those aboard (e. the two German Pinschers competed only for this title, they were not shown at the CACIB Show the day before).">

 At that time the backstreets list was renamed LuckyTown to remove any possible confusion between the backstreets mailing list and Backstreets Magazine. Recent digests can be found at the LuckyTown-Digest Recent Issues page. No relation whatsoever, other than the fact that many (most. ) people on the list are Backstreets magazine subscribers, and that the Backstreets phone hotline is a good source of rumor and innuendo. Backstreets Magazine has several active subscribers on this list, but other than that there's no connection.</td>
