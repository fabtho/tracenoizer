 While the HSPK Speciality Show organized in July attracted mainly Western-European exhibitors (from Germany, Italy, etc. It was the first time that German Pinschers have been shown at a HSPK Show.

The results are really "international" (see below), but it was a great pleasure the the BIS title was finally given to a Hungarian schnauzer.</td>
