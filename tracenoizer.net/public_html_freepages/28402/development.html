 It was developed at university of jena by the Digital Image Processing Group. It joins the experiences in research, education and application on the field of image processing of 20 years. DIAS is not only a collection of image processing tools, but an integrated development system with an own programming language. Relative low requirements to hardware allow wide use of DIAS for education and research. This allows practical work for all students without the requirement of special hardware.</td>
