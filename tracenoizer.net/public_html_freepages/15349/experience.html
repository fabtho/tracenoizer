 What better way than to list other sites and webrings. There will soon be more links and items on this site. Our web experience is limited to a few home pages we have authored. Chris Cullum We both want to thank our wives (two of the most beautiful sunday school teachers in the world) Brenda Decker and Cyndi Cullum for putting up with us. Without their love and guidance both Dennis and I would probably still be hiding out in our homes smoking pot.</td>

 It is my goal to have a satisfied, happy, healthy mom and baby, and to do that at home if possible. I first became interested in midwifery while working in Labor and Delivery in a hospital in Irving. Although I loved my job, I felt that things could and should be done differently to make birth a more positive experience for families. I felt strongly that women should be treated with more respect and kindness as they worked to give birth and should be allowed -and even encouraged to bond with their babies in the first few hours after birth. When I left the hospital setting I discovered a whole new world of alternative methods and have never doubted that this is the call of God on my life.</td>
