 These jobs however, are few and far between and increasingly, trainees from specialties other than anaesthesia will be competing for them. . Personal view point Stephen Noble, GlasgowHaving taken a rather circuitous route into anaesthesia a full seven years after graduation, this tempers my views on approaching a career in intensive care medicine (ICM). As a general principle, any training in acute medicine, surgery or emergency medicine is worthwhile. As some colleagues have found recently, this becomes more difficult to arrange once you are part of an anaesthetic department.</td>
