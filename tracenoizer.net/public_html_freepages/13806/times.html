 STEVE SNELLING, October 2001 It promises to be the last hurrah. A glorious and defiant climax in a genuinely special relation-ship, forged in war and fostered in peace, in which the rebirth of a unique living memorial will be matched by unparalleled honour. As far as our veterans are concerned, they feel they were there in worse times and they flew under worse conditions. The book was destroyed in the Central Library fire, and has been replaced by a new Roll of Honour to be carried by a relative of one of the veterans. Inset is the original appeal brochure with its grandiose vision of the library.</td>

 Island leaders believe they are now more certain than ever to prevent federal takeover attempts by the U. Commonwealth officials said it would ease efforts needed by the island government to thwart anti-CNMI legislation in the U. EPA claims that the level of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contamination in samples of taro and yams tested from Tanapag village in Saipan is at least 10 times lower than the level considered toxic, but a citizens group has urged residents to avoid eating the root crops in the face of conflicting evidence. Environmental Protection Agency Pacific Insular area program manager Norman L. Lovelace said differences in the reporting units of concentration made by EPA and independent specialists resulted in confusion which made it appear that the level of concentration was about 1,000 times higher than it actually is.</td>

 My grandmother Hamrick never talked much about my mother's teenage years but she did tell me that my mother had come home from school one day and said that she was pregnant. Mom said that mother claimed she had been attached at school several weeks before but Mom said that she knew something was wrong because school was not in session at that time. I remember visiting my mother many times during the years 1952 through December 1975. One one trip, daddy and I stopped at a little country store on Stagecoach road near Sandy Plains Baptist Church. Hamrick was with us and we stopped at a store near Stanley.</td>
