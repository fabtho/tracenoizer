 The General Assembly elected in August met on the 19th of September, 1820, and organized by electing James Caldwell, of Ste. Genevieve, speaker, and John McArthur clerk; William H. Jones were appointed Supreme Judges, each to hold office until sixty-five years of age. Benton were elected by the General Assembly to the United States Senate. We should like to give in details the meetings and proceedings of the dijfferent Legislatures which followed the elections for Governors and other State officers; the elections for Congressmen and United States Senators, but for want of space we can only present in a condensed form the official record of the Territorial and State officers.</td>
