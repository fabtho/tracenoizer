 I don't mind the fact that there was a treasure on Yavin 4, or that Q7N was guarding it, but the story that details it is simply too contradictory to accept as having happened in the way it's been told. I don't want to lose the Missions books either, so fans will just have to accept take for granted that a treasure was found on Yavin. then a month later, he loses part of it on Ord Mantell in a Sabacc game. He still has a little left and gives it to the Alliance, since it was a meager amount that he couldnt have used to pay Jabba off with. He gives it to Sprool because he has to get back to Yavin immediately for his next mission.</td>
