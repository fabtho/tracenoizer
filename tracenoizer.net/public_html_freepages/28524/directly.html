 The associated proof term calculus is a calculus with functions that must use . However, as we have previously pointed out, INCLL captures non commutativity at the level of hypotheses rather than connectives. Additionally neither of these systems directly admits the concept of a mobile hypothesis (although the latter system may be able to capture it by not constraining a hypothesis at all in the order variety) As a . To fully explore uses of an order aware logic in computer science, we would like it to conservatively extend both traditional and linear logic.

 The notion of commutativity usually concerns binary operators rather than individual properties. However, as we have previously pointed out, INCLL captures non commutativity at the level of hypotheses rather than connectives. Additionally neither of these systems directly admits the concept of a mobile hypothesis (although the latter system may be able to capture it by .
