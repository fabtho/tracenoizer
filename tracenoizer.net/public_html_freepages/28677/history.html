 It is a major contribution to the study of comparative law and through its multidisciplinary approach breaks new ground in providing a comprehensive text on the subject. Through its approachable yet scholarly style it provides the reader with an outline of the essentials of the legal system, whilst at the same time providing an historical and cultural context from which they will be able to develop an informed critique. The book covers the history, structure and tradition of the Japanese legal system, as well as providing an insight into areas of substantive law. The use of multidisciplinary sources, which are contextualised by the author, make what would otherwise be inaccessible material available for comparative analysis. This book may be used as a textbook for undergraduate and postgraduate courses.</td>
