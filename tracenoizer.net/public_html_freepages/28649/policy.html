 Opponents are lining up from many quarters, including civil liberties groups in the United States who say the treaty threatens basic civil rights, including free speech. State Department has also expressed reservations about the treaty. No one expects the treaty to become official policy any time soon, if at all. If the delegates from the various nations participating in negotiations ever manage to agree on a final draft, it would still have to be approved by the president and ratified by the Senate. But the software, movie and recording industries like the idea of being able to enforce their copyrights worldwide, and have been strong supporters of the treaty.</td>
