 This will allow the analysis of different data sets for specific areas. . Good practice will involve authorities identifying what data it feels it is critical to have available, and an ordered approach to its acquisition and maintenance. Some examples of local authority corporate information practice are available. Please email us if you have corporate information practice to share.</td>

Jacques Gansler, undersecretary of Defense for acquisition and technology, approved the list in the fall and will be briefed on possible remedies June 19, an Army official said. If Gansler approves the recommendations, it will be up to individual program managers and agencies to implement fixes. An Army spokesman with the Communications-Electronics Command, Fort Monmouth, said the service will not provide the entire list for "operational security reasons" and because it includes programs managed by the other services.</td>
