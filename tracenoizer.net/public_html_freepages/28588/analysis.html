 Each software package is modular where extended features are supported through plug-in software modules. Each package also includes an optional data acquisition module allowing the collection of raw data directly from instrumentation. PRAP (Piezoelectric Resonance Analysis Program) This software package allows the determination of complex elastic, piezoelectric, and dielectric properties of piezoelectric resonators. Included with analysis is the computation of components of Van Dyke's circuit model and those of a complex circuit model. An optional data acquisition module integrates the collection of resonance spectra from an impedance analyser.</td>

 Generalized Linear Complementarity Problems and the. In this paper we present an overview of this research. Since hybrid systems exhibit characteristics of both CVSs and DESs, this suggests that extensions of the LCP will probably also be useful in the analysis of hybrid systems. 2 Generalized and Extended Linear Complementarity Problems One of . Although the analogues of these problems in conventional algebra and linear system theory are easy to solve, the max algebraic problems are not that easy to solve and for almost all of them the ELCP approach is at present the only way to solve the problem.</td>
