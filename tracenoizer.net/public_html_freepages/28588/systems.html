 If Gansler approves the recommendations, it will be up to individual program managers and agencies to implement fixes. An Army spokesman with the Communications-Electronics Command, Fort Monmouth, said the service will not provide the entire list for "operational security reasons" and because it includes programs managed by the other services. The systems were identified by the CINC Interoperability Program Offices. The Defense Department established one CINC interoperability program office in each of the three services to work directly with the CINCs in identifying problems with the ability of information systems to share data. The CIPOs also work with the CINCS to ensure that new information systems being developed address interoperability from program inception.</td>

 The data required for a local housing strategy will be both quantitative and qualitative. Qualtitative data adds meaning and can aid interpretation of quantitative data. They are complementary and in combination, these two types of data can be used to uncover root causes of problems within housing systems. Good practice examples of how data might be combined to look at specific housing problems and issues are available. In some cases data will have to be collected because it does not exist in any readily accessible form.</td>

derived for the minimal realization problem in the max plus semiring. The minimal realization problem is the problem of nding the minimal realization dimension of a given one letter max plus rational series. This problem has strong motivations in the context of discrete event systems see, e. The following result is an immediate consequence of Theorem 6. Theorem 7 The problem of determining, for a given matrix A 2 f1; 0g n n and vectors b; c 2 f1; 0g n over .</td>
