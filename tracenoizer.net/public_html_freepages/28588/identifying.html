 An Army spokesman with the Communications-Electronics Command, Fort Monmouth, said the service will not provide the entire list for "operational security reasons" and because it includes programs managed by the other services. The systems were identified by the CINC Interoperability Program Offices. The Defense Department established one CINC interoperability program office in each of the three services to work directly with the CINCs in identifying problems with the ability of information systems to share data. The CIPOs also work with the CINCS to ensure that new information systems being developed address interoperability from program inception. Some were technical, some were policy problems, and some were procedural problems," said Army Col.</td>
