 This will allow the analysis of different data sets for specific areas. . Good practice will involve authorities identifying what data it feels it is critical to have available, and an ordered approach to its acquisition and maintenance. Some examples of local authority corporate information practice are available. Please email us if you have corporate information practice to share.</td>
