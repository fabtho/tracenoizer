 (The publisher once claimed one in four Norwegians reads Donald Duck every week. When the DD ban was proposed, we received a million (I counted) clippings from various newspapers read by our friends who were delighted to find something with which to give him a little garbage. ) In any case, my ex- ended up calling his mother in Kuopio, and asking her to clip and send any Finnish news articles that she could find relating to the story. The proposed ban was real, but the motivations were political in some murky Northern sort of way. It was never intended to be taken seriously; someone was trying to make a point.</td>

 In 1935 Barks got a job at Disney, where he wanted to find a safe workplace. First he worked there on animations, but he started early to sell jokes and scripts to the comicstrip-department. Then Disney got the idea that it would be better when Barks work on the story and not on the animation. Barks worked the next years on about 35 short films. But Barks didn't like his job, because the cartoons should show good animation and Barks wanted to tell good stories.</td>
