 It doesn't matter how much humiliation the world dishes out to him, Donald will take it and come back for more. He's a loser, not a quitter, and he'll go down fighting. This is a duck with one short fuse, and an amazing (if unintelligible) command of language, and when things don't go right, he goes ballistic. Yet after the storm is over and the tantrum is through, when faithful Daisy soothes his brow or his conscience finally catches up with him, even Donald can admit that there must be a better way.

 (See the pages about the film Aladdin and The Lion King talking toy for similar examples. ) At first listen, it's easy to hear what we're told to hear, "god damn stupid nigger. " Donald is rarely easy to understand, and people have supposedly heard him say all sorts of risque things. In 1995, a 1937 Mickey Mouse cartoon called "Clock Cleaners" contained in Walt Disney Cartoon Classics series' video "Fun on the Job" made the news because it allegedly included a frustrated Donald Duck shouting "Fuck you. ", leading Wal-Mart to pull the video from its shelves.</td>
