 I think a lot more companies should be involved in industrial placement skills even though it is only for six months it is cheap labour. You can get an undergraduate who is doing a six months placement to do just the same job as a graduate at half the salary. (Car Fleet Manager, multinational reprographic equipment manufacturer) Work experience provides the possibility that students might contribute an injection of new ideas into the organisation. If they do a placement with us obviously that is the optimum solution. It provides the student with an opportunity to see how they like us and how we like them.</td>
