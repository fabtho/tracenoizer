 (Owner, small design consultancy) In addition there are, in some circumstances, high costs in establishing an appropriate work-station for work-experience students. We used to take on a number of sandwich students, we take less on now. The big problem now is that in the old days you gave the technical designer either a relatively cheap computer or a drawing board and a bit of software and they could get on and do some work and design. Half of that is hardware and you can write that off over two years. For many employers, the initial reaction to work experience tends to be that the process has resource implications, and that, in effect the benefits are a gamble.</td>
