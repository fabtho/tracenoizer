Often contacts are personal and disappear when personnel change. Such a lack of communication may lead not just to a duplication of effort, but may discourage employers if they have no clear point of contact. However, this does require clear points of contact within the institution and good communication flows. They may find the confusion, and the time and effort involved, too much and may turn to an alternative institution or even forget the whole idea.">
