 Or, more exactly, with a set dependent on the recipient address (a user can have several addresses with different restriction sets). To achieve this effect, we insert a check_recipient_access map lookup just before the RBL client check. we must always specify permit at the end of a user list, otherwise a lack of match in the restriction list for that recipient will cause the system to continue processing the main recipient restrictions list, which is not what we want. If the user wants these checks, they must also be explicitly added in the list. This general strategy can be applied, of course, to any kind of restriction and not just to those relative to RBL lists.</td>

If you want to edit a script file or a binary file, you should set the 'binary' option before loading the file. UNC names are also recognized (if the system supports them); e. If SHELL is defined, it is used instead, and if SHELL is not defined but COMSPEC is, COMPSPEC is used. If you are running a third-party shell, you may need to set the .</td>
