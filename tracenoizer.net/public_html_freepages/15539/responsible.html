 Many enumerators over the years did fill in the occupation column with such entries as "keeping house" (NOT the same as housekeeper. ), "at home," or "at school," in order to show that the person was engaged in other activities without an occupation. 1930 was the first enumeration to specifically show which person in the household was most responsible for "keeping" the household. QT__________________________________________________Do You Yahoo. So this means that Homemaker was not considered anoccupation in 1930, as it sporadically was in previouscensuses.</td>

 Leaders of the online pharmacy industry, the medical community, policy makers and consumer advocates are scheduled to meet in early November to discuss strategies raised by "rogue" online pharmacy sites. .com Receives Accolades for Responsible Service In line with increased demand for credibility of Internet pharmaceutical purchases, the National Association of Board's of Pharmacy yesterday bestowed PlanetRx. com with the Verified Internet Pharmacy Practice Sites award. In essence, this stamp of approval ensures the site is a legitimate provider of pharmacy services and is licensed and registered with the appropriate state agencies.</td>
