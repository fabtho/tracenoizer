This book describes various obstacles confronting the automation of reasoning and proposes 33 research problems whose solution could significantly advance the power of reasoning programs now in use.

 The bomber problem See description The rendezvous problem See description Search for a moving target See abstract Non-preemptive release of stochastic jobs to uniform machines See abstract The unimportance of inserted idle time in non-preemptive stochastic scheduling to minimize flow time on parallel machines home page . . Unsolved Problems in OR Unsolved Problems in OR This page contains a list of open problems that I find intriguing. They are not as difficult or as significant as the question of whether P does or not equal NP. But these are problems that are easy to state and understand, but whose solution has defied the efforts of good researchers over a number of years.</td>

Help evaluate a new question answering search engine. These tools have become quite popular, and are helping to redefine how people think about wide-area network applications. In this paper we indicate trends in these three dimensions and survey problems these trends will create for current approaches. We then suggest several promising directions of future resource discovery research,. in the August 1994 issue of the Communications of the ACM on Internet Technology .</td>
