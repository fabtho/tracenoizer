 During my years as a lawyer we purchased three properties from our joint earnings. The latter was in my son's name; the summerhouse, in my wife's. The media has launched a series of extremely dishonest attacks against my son, who has been working as a lawyer for 13 years, and who lives in a separate family. This is what has been shown in the various media broadcasts, this is what has appeared in photographs in the newspapers. The building in question is being erected with proceeds from the sale of the flat in Aradi Street, from my earnings as a lawyer and with the help of the family.</td>

 The answers, of course, lie in examining the story of Countess Elizabeth Bathory. Born in 1560 to George Bathory (Ecsed branch) and Anna Bathory (Somlyo branch), Elizabeth was yet another product of the intermarriage between the dwindling Hungarian noble families. The Bathory family was "one of the richest and most powerful Protestant families in all Hungary. To receive some insight into the soul of Elizabeth, the presentation of an incident during her childhood could prove enlightening. Though it is not stated exactly when, occurring sometime after she turned six and before eleven, a band of gypsies were invited to her home at Ecsed Castle to provide entertainment at the court.</td>
