 Now 39, he has smoked up to two packages of cigarettes a day since age 14. " Since the advent of the free-market system in Hungary after communism faded away in 1989, Lorincz has felt under extreme stress, never knowing whether he would be able to keep his job as a plumber or whether he would be out of work and unable to feed his family.

 A Cultural Melting-Pot Sources for Further Reading Acknowledgments Origins of the Hungarians The Hungarians, or Magyars, come originally from Asia, though precisely where has never been established. They settled in the Carpathian Basin along the Danube, where the nation of Hungary continues to this day. For the next 100 years, they terrorized the kingdoms of Europe on horseback, sometimes making two raids in the same year.
