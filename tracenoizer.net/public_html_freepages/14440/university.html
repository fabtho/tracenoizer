 Israel Chair and Ithaca composer Ann Silsbee, along with Dana Wilson at Ithaca College and Jim Willey at SUNY-Geneseo, judged the competition for the Society. As in the past, they followed procedures for blind judging, and as usual there were a good number of excellent entries. He joined the Syracuse University School of Music faculty upon completion of his graduate studies, and remained there until his untimely death from leukemia at age 35. A prolific composer, Brian won several awards and received numerous commissions, among them a commission from the Society for New Music. Several of his works have been recorded on Spectrum, Redwood, and Pro-Viva.</td>
