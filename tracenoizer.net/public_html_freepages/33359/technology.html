 So the observer is part of the world he sees, therefore part of the point of intersection, the inner side of the world. He is a captive of the world, though he is condemned to be only able to observe the world from within, therefore virtually he becomes the outside observer as well. With the help of new technology and new world concepts, he can transform himself into an outside observer of the world who is pushed to the wall of the cave from the outside. The citizen of the world becomes the fictive outside observer of the world in which he lives. .</td>

 There are hundreds of thousands of artists on the net but you would never find them, it would take you years. ' But if somebody has the time to concentrate and to select then you can just click and then you can see it. The next is for me the most interesting function of a curator and that is to understand the technology as a tool. That means a curator can know even more than the artist can. He can study theory and then can commission a work.</td>
