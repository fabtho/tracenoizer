 (Aristotle, or the World as a Stage) One plays the role of an outside observer in the realistic and objective model of the world. He is a spectator who does not have a say in the plot. For him, the present laws of nature lead and direct the state of things and the turning of the world. God is the mighty master of time and the world is the clockwork created by him, since it has already been put in motion, it is working eternally according to the same laws, therefore it is not influenced by the subjectivity of man. In the classical theatrical model of the world, the observer sits in the audience and watches a world where things happen without him.</td>

 So the curator's job is not only to make an exhibition of existing work or traditional work, as in a museum. A curator also has to remember that a virtual museum can consist of additional work, being rendered two-dimensionally or digitally; it can be media work. So the most important other thing is to develop new things that another museum cannot do, what I call new formats. A curator can ask 'how can I combine photography, video, computer, and the Internet. What could be a new format, a new way of story telling, or a new lifestyle, new activities.</td>
