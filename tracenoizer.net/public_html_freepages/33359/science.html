 This interview will appear in the November German-language issue of Balkon Contemporary Arts Magazine in Budapest. It is not only an art show, it is not a show about single masters, but about different movements. The idea was that you cannot strictly separate between art and science. A scientific product is different from an artistic product, but the method is similar. That means the next step is that you observe something.</td>
