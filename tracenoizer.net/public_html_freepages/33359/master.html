 People know how to push a button for a coffee but they don't know how the coffee machine works.

 He is a spectator who does not have a say in the plot. For him, the present laws of nature lead and direct the state of things and the turning of the world. God is the mighty master of time and the world is the clockwork created by him, since it has already been put in motion, it is working eternally according to the same laws, therefore it is not influenced by the subjectivity of man. In the classical theatrical model of the world, the observer sits in the audience and watches a world where things happen without him. This model, the one which says that our observation does not influence the turning of the world, is the basis of the classical mechanistic world concept.</td>

 I am interested what are the conditions of perception, of obervation. What are the material conditions, the cognitive, the social conditions. So my approach is very different from the normal art historical approach, according to which one artist follows the other, one master another, which is a WRONG conception of the evolution. One artist adds to the other artist, and they all follow the same method. The method for example in the 20's cubism was abstract geometrization.</td>
