 We are part of the world we observe and which we, through this observation, see only distortedly. The world is accessible only through our observation, which is the curtain between us and the world. Today we call this curtain the point of intersection. The world as the point of intersection therefore means that the so-called objective reality is the inner part of an outside world, the part which for the observer can only be accessible from the inside, and which he is only capable of seeing. Hence we have a new world concept, the curtain model, or the intersection model.</td>

 When I started at ZKM they had the 'Multimediale,' and I stopped it, because this festival had a historical role that is now over. The role of Multimediale was (in the 80s, and beginning of 90s), to promote media art, to make it more widely accepted. But today, when Nam June Paik attracts a mass audience and is as popular as Mickey Mouse, then it is because of the festivals promoting media art. Media art festivals have now become a routine element. It is no longer a forum where you have new subjects, new issues, new ideas, and new names.</td>
