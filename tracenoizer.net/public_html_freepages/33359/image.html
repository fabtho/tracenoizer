 Hence we have a new world concept, the curtain model, or the intersection model. In this non-classical world concept, the observer is not only the spectator but also the actor on the world stage. I have stored the image of a brick wall in the computer, which will be projected on the wall of the museum with the help of a data processor. If an observer stands in front of the wall, the videocamera records him. The computer transforms analogue signals recorded by the videocamera into lines of drawings, which influence the digital sign sequence of the brick wall, which has been stored in the computer.</td>

 But what is useful is actually to go to some places to discover new artists that are not part of this electronic community. You have to go there and find out there still are other existing artists, to see there are others beside this one you have already approached. So in the end local research is also necessary to get, as much as possible, an objective image. But first of all - this is my approach and maybe it is not an approach many people share - you need a theory. You can go to the jungle without a map, but it will take you a long time to discover what a jungle is.</td>
