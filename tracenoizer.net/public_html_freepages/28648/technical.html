 CASSP helps children and adolescents with emotional disturbances to gain access to needed services. These services are planned collaboratively with the child's or adolescent's family, the mental health system, the school and other agencies. CASSP also gives technical assistance to provider agencies on state-of-the-art mental health services for children and adolescents, supports best practice and assists in communication among all those who serve children in Pennsylvania. A BRIEF HISTORY OF CASSP A national study in 1982 found that two-thirds of all children with severe emotional disturbances were not receiving appropriate services. These children were "unclaimed" by the public agencies responsible to serve them, and there was little coordination among the various child-serving systems.</td>

 The cleaning industry took me from Sweden to the Middle East, Far East and finally to the USA and Phoenix. Below you will find three main categories you can click on to get information about our services and products. The technical definition of cleaning is defined as a process removing pollutants and undesired substances from an environment or surface to reduce damage or harm to human health or valuable materials. Or to formulate it more to the point "It's Not Clean - Until It's SwedeClean". Our products are about "Clean Better, Clean Smarter".</td>
