 "One of the first people to offer his congratulations was Mr Mandelson, who gave Mr Drummond a solid handshake and said he believed him to be "very committed". "I will operate with you in every way I can," he told Mr Drummond. The problems for Labour's mayoral candidates in the north-east may not be over. "Robocop" Ray Mallon will be discovering at around lunchtime whether his bid for political office has been a success. The former Cleveland police chief superintendent, credited with bringing US-style zero-tolerance policing to Britain, is seeking to become the first directly-elected mayor of Middlesbrough.</td>

 On June 10, 1863, General Morgan arrived in Alexandria for the last time; tradition says that he again spent the night at Browning Tavern. Orders were at once issued to prepare the division to march the next day. On June 11, 1863, Morgan's troops marched out of Alexandria to embark on the greatest of all his raids, the one which would carry them through Indiana and Ohio to the farthest point north reached by any Confederate troops. The division was finally captured and imprisoned, but General Morgan made a daring escape from prison. The departure of Morgan's troops from DeKalb County on June 11, 1863, was followed in a short time by the withdrawal of General Bragg's Army of Tennessee from Tullahoma.</td>
