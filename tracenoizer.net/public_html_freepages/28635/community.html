 . how do we take what Swidler tells us in his commandments and put it into action. (I think I told all of you I am finishing an incomplete) My concern was that in order to implement the global ethic that we are all working towards, there would need to be a set of guidelines that eventually we would all (global community) have to follow. When I thought about this, as crazy as it seemed that we should be talking about this when referring to global ethics, how else would we as a community ensure that it would work. I am not one who believes that you will assimilate or be cast aside, but during this crucial transition from the world as it is today, to the world of the Global Ethic, there will need to be some governing authority to oversee any altercations or disagreements that will no doubt ensue.</td>

 If any of these goals strike you as pipedreams, prepare to have your optimism refreshed. The changes that have swept through charitable organizations over the past decade have been no less breathtaking than the electronic revolution that has energized science and business. Organizations that address the needs of a community have placed an unprecedented focus on the causes and prevention of human suffering, rather than the treatment of symptoms. United Way has been one of the leading proponents of this preventions-focused approach to caring for people and communities. This is a plan to give every man, woman and child in our valley an opportunity to build a life of work, discipline and rewards.</td>
