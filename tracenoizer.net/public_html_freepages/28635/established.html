 This itinerary begins as you drive in from the north ex Perth. Day 1 Travelling from Perth along the Albany Highway you pass through the communities of Williams and Arthur River before arriving at the town of Kojonup. First established as a military outpost in 1837 to protect the mail run from Albany to Perth, Kojonup today supports the surrounding farming areas and is home to the annual Wildflower Festival during springtime. From Kojonup continue on to Cranbrook before heading east to the spectacular and scenic Stirling Range National Park. Time should be taken here to enjoy one of the many bushwalks or, for the more adventurous, a climb up Bluff Knoll offers some magnificent views of the surrounding countryside.</td>
