They will determine how their recycling center will operate, what materials will be required, and the jobs that will be needed. They will design their system so it is integrated with the school's recycling system. Students will have the opportunity to practice the recycling process in their setting. The development of the recycling center will act as a stimuli for continued reflection of the need to reduce trash and to care about the Earth.</td>
