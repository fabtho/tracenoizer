 After lunch, we switched to colts who are buddies-- Abraham (a sorrel pinto curly colt) and Sir ALncelot (a very dark bay weanling colt). Robin Pooler of Orrington, Maine graciously accepted my invitation to spin at the booth again this year. In response to the public's increasing interest- she is expanding her business to include some Curly products-- shirts, fiber articles, etc. You can visit her web site at Flying Horse Farm , Or click here to see some of the shirts that will be included in her line. they also have Curlies of their own Demo is all over- and we are happy.</td>

 net I'm just learning about the net, and I found this site. I am a crone-aged graduate student at the University here in Maine and will be doing my thesis on sacred space and circles in Ireland and Cornwall. I've done a small bit of business off and on with y'all for about 7 or 8 years now, and always loved the jewelry work that you have produced. Blessings of prosperity on this business, hope you're around for a long,long time. edu great stuff, i'll be sure to be back when i have money.</td>
