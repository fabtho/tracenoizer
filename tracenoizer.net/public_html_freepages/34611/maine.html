 A buckskin weanling colt- Oxahala- took his turn in the morning hours. After lunch, we switched to colts who are buddies-- Abraham (a sorrel pinto curly colt) and Sir ALncelot (a very dark bay weanling colt). Robin Pooler of Orrington, Maine graciously accepted my invitation to spin at the booth again this year. In response to the public's increasing interest- she is expanding her business to include some Curly products-- shirts, fiber articles, etc. You can visit her web site at Flying Horse Farm , Or click here to see some of the shirts that will be included in her line.</td>
