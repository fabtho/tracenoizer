 A front end to this program can be found at John Pettigrew's website. It is more of an example of the things you can do with AMPlayer rather than anything useful. ControlAMPlayer allows you to control it from the keypad, even out of the desktop. It notates simple music as a simple string of characters indicating the pitch and duration. DJF-JRF is my player for such tunes; it supports both external edits and WimpCTCP playing.</td>
