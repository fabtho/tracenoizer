 Large scale mosaics in high quality natural materials. Our philosophy is to work with the integrity of natural stone to enhance its spiritaul nature using sound craft practice. Shaun and Peter met four years ago and work as a team on major commissions, both public and private, through out England and Scotland. It is hoped to bring many commissions to the workshops, to run courses in stone carving, extablish training and work with people with disabilities. A particular interest by both artists in Celtic, Anglo-Saxon and Viking designs and styles of carving could lead, it is hoped to courses in carving these styles.</td>

 Currently drives a Ford Fiesta, but is trying to import a little German model. Piper Alan "Nick Leeson" Flaherty Alan hasn't been seen at the band for some time now, and rumour has it that he's been locked in a jail in Bangkok. Piper Shaun "Stephen Hendry" Forbes Shaun has spent a great deal of time training for the Ashbourne Gathering Pool Championships. Walking into an unsuspecting bar, Shaun dazzles the locals with his ability to keep all 7 red balls on the table. Quickly signed up for the local pool team, Shaun caps off his debut by missing a sitter over the pocket and sending the cue ball half way across the pub.</td>
