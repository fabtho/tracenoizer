 In addition a community in Oldham, Greater Manchester commissioned two stone circles with carved symbols, which were positioned two weeks ago. In early 2001 they are to undertake carving for the restoration of the Church of St. A belief in artisic integrity, handcraft skills and a professional approach to all commissions, large and small are the foundations of their business. Public commissions, they believe should be undertaken only after full consultation and co-operation with the community into which the sculpture is to be sited and for which it is being created. Any artist who cannot work in partnership with local people to realise the communities aims should consider their position as community artists.</td>

Piper Ian "Arfur" Allen Since he started work in the reedmaking business, Ian' skills in salesmanship have soared. Concealed about his person, Ian carries everything from spare pipe reeds to silver mounted pipes, "should a need or customer arise". Outside of work, Ian gets about on motorcycle, which may well explain why his reeds are always "blown in".</td>
