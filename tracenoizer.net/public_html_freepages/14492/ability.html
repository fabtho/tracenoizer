 Piper Alan "Nick Leeson" Flaherty Alan hasn't been seen at the band for some time now, and rumour has it that he's been locked in a jail in Bangkok. Piper Shaun "Stephen Hendry" Forbes Shaun has spent a great deal of time training for the Ashbourne Gathering Pool Championships. Walking into an unsuspecting bar, Shaun dazzles the locals with his ability to keep all 7 red balls on the table. Quickly signed up for the local pool team, Shaun caps off his debut by missing a sitter over the pocket and sending the cue ball half way across the pub. Recently, Shaun has been modelling kiltie brogues as an up and coming nightclub accessory.</td>
