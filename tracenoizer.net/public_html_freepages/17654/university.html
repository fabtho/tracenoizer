 Comparability is promoted across all delivery locations through the application of an agreed set of norms. The external examiner looks at those scripts lying outside of the expected norms and is also provided with a statistical report prior to the examination board. Noting that the role of a moderator could mean scrutinising in excess of 300 scripts, University teaching staff explained that the task was a particularly onerous one undertaken in addition to existing responsibilities. From the information made available to it, the team concluded that the standards of the awards were appropriate. The database is made available to partner organisations on a commercial basis.</td>
