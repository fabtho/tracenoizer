 Native American History Class Projects Native American History Class Projects Documentary editing projects developed in collaboration between students in Prof. Peter Wood's Native American History class and The Digital Scriptorium The following are projects developed by Duke University students in Professor Peter Wood's Native American History class (HST 119). They are based on documentary sources from the Duke University Special Collections Library and were developed in collaboration with the library's Digital Scriptorium. They include transcribed text from manuscripts, scanned images of photographs and manuscript pages, and analytical essays by the students. Note that these links take you to files in the personal directories (on another server) of the student authors, and the students (not the Special Collections Library) are responsible for the content and maintenance of the web pages found there.</td>
