<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" As part of its activity, QAA undertakes regular academic quality audits of individual institutions to review the operation and effectiveness of arrangements for assuring quality and standards. Quality audits also cover the arrangements which institutions use to assure the quality and standards of their programmes and awards offered in collaboration with other institutions, both within and outwith the UK. As part of an audit of overseas collaborative partnerships, QAA audit teams visit overseas partners to gain first-hand experience of the ways in which UK institutions safeguard the quality and standards of their programmes and awards. A principal purpose of these audits is to help to support and enhance confidence in the work of British universities and colleges operating overseas. In the summer of 1999, QAA audited selected partnership links between UK universities and partners in South Africa.">
