 Trish and I want to thank President Barker for inviting us to join the Clemson family, and we look forward to helping Clemson achieve its goal of being one of the nation's top universities," Phillips said. "It will be a challenge to succeed Bobby Robinson, who is a highly respected athletic administrator and has done a superb job for Clemson University. We're looking forward to building on the foundation he has created. During that time, Arkansas played in the Sugar Bowl twice and participated in the 1969 Texas-Arkansas game that produced the national champion. Phillips earned his master's and doctor of education degrees from Virginia Tech, where he served as an assistant football coach from 1971-1978.</td>
