 . Systems is the largest research area in the Computer Laboratory covering hardware, communications hardware and software, operating systems and distributed systems. Past systems developed here include Edsac, the Titan operating system, the Cambridge Ring and the Cambridge Distributed Computing System. The thrust is open distributed processing with an object orientated approach. We look to support emerging distributed applications in which users and devices may be mobile and may have multimedia presentation requirements.</td>

 Additionally, we try to produce and distribute usable versions of the developed software. 5, a synthetic real-time application for measuring scheduling behavior. 3, the Active Network Transport System, with new optimizations and many other improvements. 0, with new security features, other improvements, and new documentation. Patrick's Day'' snapshot-20020317, the Janos NodeOS, with many improvements and bug-fixes.</td>

 After all, this is computer science, not real science. . Operating Systems Project Information Current Operating Systems Projects and OS-related research This page contains pointers to all sorts of neat operating system projects scattered across the world-wide web. I've categorized all of the systems into all sorts of broad, inappropriate categories to make it easier to sort through. The full list is also of course available if you're a masochist.</td>
