 We look forward to seeing you again soon at one of our conferences. . The International Association of Science and Technology for Development (IASTED), is a non-profit organization founded in Zurich, Switzerland in 1977. The purpose of IASTED is to promote economic development through science and technology. This goal is achieved through the more than 300 conferences IASTED has organized in over 25 countries around the world.</td>

 Experimentation by CBS students covered wide areas of the continuum necessary for successful plant based life support. One student worked to maximize germination in the porous tube plant nutrient delivery system (PTPNDS) space flight hardware. Three students explored the use and optimization of light emitting diode (LED) technology and its implications for salad crop growth and bacterial proliferation on leaf surfaces. One student performed shoot gravitropism analyses on radish seedlings as preliminary work for a future space shuttle experiment. Two students worked on closing the loop of plant production by experimenting with sensing technology and a variety of inoculum treatments to enhance composting of inedible biomass.</td>

 If you meet the above criteria, please go to the instructions for the Participant Agreement Form and the Student Profile Form. If you have questions about grant eligibility or about the CSS program, please call Will Giorgini, educational adviser, at 206-685-6302. The grant enables UW to deliver an innovative solution to the acute lack of skilled technology professionals needed to design, implement and manage computer-based enterprises. The CSS Professional Program consists of seven evening and distance learning certificate programs in high-demand, computer-related areas. .</td>
