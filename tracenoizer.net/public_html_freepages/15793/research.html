 Through integrated research and education, the reserves help communities develop strategies to deal successfully with these coastal resource issues. . National Estuarine Research Reserves The National Estuarine Research Reserve System protects and studies estuarine areas through a network of 25 reserves. These important coastal habitats are used as spawning grounds and nurseries for at least two-thirds of the nation's commercial fish and shellfish. The wetlands associated with estuaries buffer uplands from flooding.</td>

 The IDRC Resource Clock has tracked the increase of human population and decrease of arable land since 1987, when the first clock was installed in the front lobby of IDRC's Ottawa headquarters. . International Development Research Centre - Science for Humanity The International Development Research Centre is a public corporation created by the Canadian government to help communities in the developing world find solutions to social, economic, and environmental problems through research. His cheerful demeanour belies the enormous challenge posed by the fight against poverty, the focus of his research and his daily work. This is the point of view of Hans Schreirer, a Canadian researcher who has extensively studied water and resource issues in the Himalayas and Andes.</td>
