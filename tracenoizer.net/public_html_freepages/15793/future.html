 aerospace industry so they can be applied to technologies for commercial and military aircraft and space vehicles. Key technologies investigated aboard the F-18 SRA include advanced power-by-wire concepts, electric-powered actuators and mechanical systems, fly-by-light (fiber optic cable) systems and advanced computer architectures. Future aircraft that will benefit are the high-speed civil transport, next-generation general aviation and military aircraft. In addition, the program is developing advanced flight-test techniques that will be used on future aircraft. Project Objectives Accelerate the transition of new aerospace technologies to commercial, military, and access to space vehicles.</td>

 One student worked to maximize germination in the porous tube plant nutrient delivery system (PTPNDS) space flight hardware. Three students explored the use and optimization of light emitting diode (LED) technology and its implications for salad crop growth and bacterial proliferation on leaf surfaces. One student performed shoot gravitropism analyses on radish seedlings as preliminary work for a future space shuttle experiment. Two students worked on closing the loop of plant production by experimenting with sensing technology and a variety of inoculum treatments to enhance composting of inedible biomass. In addition to lab activities students were exposed to seminars and tours encompassing all of the ongoing life science research at KSC and in other NASA and university programs.</td>
