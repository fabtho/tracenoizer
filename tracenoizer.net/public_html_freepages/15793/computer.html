 . We all introduced ourselves, to find a diverse range of backgrounds, experiences and interests. Some people had come straight from their first degrees (varying from economics to computer science, from psychology to engineering, and from statistics to artificial intelligence) whilst others had been professionals for years. There was also a number of different nationalities represented. After settling down to the work it was clear that we all had our own strengths and weaknesses which enabled the students to support one another and learn from others.</td>

 The projects and publications links below lead to fuller information about this and other work in the group. . Systems is the largest research area in the Computer Laboratory covering hardware, communications hardware and software, operating systems and distributed systems. Past systems developed here include Edsac, the Titan operating system, the Cambridge Ring and the Cambridge Distributed Computing System. The thrust is open distributed processing with an object orientated approach.</td>
