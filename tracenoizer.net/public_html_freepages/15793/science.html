 We look forward to seeing you again soon at one of our conferences. . The International Association of Science and Technology for Development (IASTED), is a non-profit organization founded in Zurich, Switzerland in 1977. The purpose of IASTED is to promote economic development through science and technology. This goal is achieved through the more than 300 conferences IASTED has organized in over 25 countries around the world.</td>

 Ordinarily, awards are made for extended periods, typically five years. . Research Corporation has, since its founding, been actively engaged in strengthening academic science. The 1990s saw the introduction of the invitation only Department Development Program that has already impacted four predominantly undergraduate institutions (University of Wisconsin at Eau Claire, Lawrence University, Hendrix College, and Western Washington University). The Science Development Program is an outgrowth of the Department Development Program that broadens its mission and operation.</td>
