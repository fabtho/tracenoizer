 David Jacobs Can you compare 'gray' alien inteligence to human intelligence. .com Presents The UFO Experience University For more than a decade, the city of North Haven Connecticut played host to one of the most distinguished UFO conferences in the country. Omega Communications' "The UFO Experience" annually brought together the most distinguished, best-known - and occasionally the most controversial - speakers on the subjects of UFOs, crop circles, alien abduction and other paranormal topics. These talks were often heavily illustrated with color slides and video clips and followed by lively question and answer sessions with the audience.</td>
