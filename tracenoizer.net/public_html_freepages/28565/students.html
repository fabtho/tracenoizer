 Like all modules in this masters course it is run in intensive mode, with one week's contact teaching, preceded by one week's preparatory reading, and followed by a one week practical assignment. The course text (Software Engineering in B, by Wordsworth) is mercifully light regarding the extensive formal underpinnings of B, making it suitable for use in this course format.

The B-Toolkit certainly brings the material to life for students in a way that pure chalk and talk could never do. Michigan State University Department of Computer Science and Engineering Prof.</td>
