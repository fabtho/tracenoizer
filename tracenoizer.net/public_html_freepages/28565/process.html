 Precise alignment is critical to molding the super-small, super-fast circuits, according to Sreenivasan, whose expertise is in precision machinery. His research team built the first step and flash machines from stripped-down equipment donated by IBM. The researchers said economics alone will give their process an immediate competitive edge. Step and flash already has the ability to process chips as fast as optical lithography, but much cheaper, they said. Beyond that lies the potential to create still smaller devices at even higher speeds.</td>

 The B book (Software Engineering in B) motivates the method well and describes it clearly and completely. The B-Toolkit allowed them to see the benefits of formality, reinforced their understanding of the B method, and provided them concrete feedback about their designs. Following the module on B, the class covered process algebras, temporal logic, and model checking. In 1995 I switched to using the B-Method for teaching formal methods. It quickly became clear that the B-Toolkit was able to synthesise all of these techniques, and bring them to life in a way that gave students a real appreciation of a practical formal software development process.</td>
