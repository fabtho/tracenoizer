 Many universities are now teaching B on their Masters Courses, and an increasing number are beginning to teach B at undergraduate level. The B-Toolkit is now widely regarded as the de-facto standard tool for teaching mathematically-based methods of software development at Universities and is currently used worldwide at over forty universities. See University Testimonials for a selection of comments. B-Core has recognized that capital expenditure budgets are tight in most university departments and has accordingly made the toolkit available on a yearly leasing scheme, which fits in more comfortably as a revenue expenditure item. We believe that the Teaching Licence prices are extremely cost-effective, and, indeed, have not risen since they were introduced in 1994.</td>
