 "If you are not going to listen to my evidence, you can take me back to my cell and you can run this Jewish fiasco the way you want," said Winrod, also known for his hatred of nonwhites and the government. Winrod, pastor of Our Savior's Church, faces up to 30 years in prison on charges he kidnapped six of his grandchildren from their fathers in North Dakota in the mid-1990s and hid them on his farm. In his opening statement, prosecutor Tom Cline said the children looked like "whipped puppies" when authorities took them from the farm after years of "brainwashing and indoctrination" into Winrod's church. Jurors also heard taped telephone conversations between the children and their mothers, who were in a North Dakota jail on separate abduction charges. The North Dakota Department of Corrections taped the phone calls to find out where the children were.</td>

 Within Peoples Temple, there was always suspicion of intelligence agency involvement in the high-powered campaign to destroy the church. Then a fierce smear campaign burst on the scene, in the Murdoch and Hearst presses in San Francisco. All investigations that were whipped up were later dropped for lack of evidence. Every attempt to rebut the charges in the press was met with a refusal to print a word. Intensive lobbying campaigns in both Washington and Georgetown (the Guyanese capital) ensued.</td>
