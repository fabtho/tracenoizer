 We build heroes, inflate martyrs and devalue the roles of other activists. Too frequently we defer decision making to our experts or priests. Certainly we have created a martyr of Judi Bari, but let's face it, the woman was vilified by many in Earth First. And while I believe that her life story as told today by many in her amen corner is false and misleading, they have every right to tell the story any way they choose.
