 The fourth grave, for Anna Mae Aquash, had been excavated the night before by four young Oglala women, one of whom had lay down in the hole to measure it. The wind whipped the upside-down American flag that hung next to the two medicine men praying to the four winds in the Sioux way. The mourners threw down presents to be entombed with the dead woman.

The people looked to have been dead for approximately 24 hours. Dakota started to bring Meditation around it, she would tell Bill about this horror when she got home. She stopped Meditation and waited listening carefully.</td>
