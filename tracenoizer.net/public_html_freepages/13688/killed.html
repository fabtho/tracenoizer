 The funeral cortege of 75 cars and pick-up trucks followed the station wagon to the grave site on Wallace Little's ranch a few miles east of Highway 18. The graves on the hill-top plot already told of the tragedies of life and death on Pine Ridge. Two years before, the first grave had been dug for Little's son, killed by a white man in Florida. In June, 1975, the second grave was dug for Joe Stuntz, killed in the shooting on the Jumping Bull land. A few months later another of Little's sons was buried there, after being kicked to death in Oglala in a fight over a pair of spurs.</td>

 " Dakota's voice was a calming purr she was hoping to convince her angry wife. If I can fool them and get vital information to safe lives its worth it. I want to stop them before more innocents get killed like our babies parents. I promise," Dakota said as she gathered Jackie in her arms her love had burst into tears. Jackie knew she couldn't fight it but she was terrified.</td>
