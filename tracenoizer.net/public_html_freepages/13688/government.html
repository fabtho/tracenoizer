 Gordon Winrod, 73, who chose to represent himself in court, refused to leave his cell and would not allow his public defender to participate.

 The unseasonal thaw that three weeks before had led to the discovery of Anna Mae's body had given way to bitter cold. The corpse awaited its second burial bound in blankets and robes, resting on a log pole bier inside a canvas-covered teepee near the rickety building known as Jumping Bull Hall. Indian youths took axes to the government-supplied coffin and burned it in a bonfire outside. The weather worsened and the mourners huddled around two wood stoves improvised from 50-gallon drums, which provided slight comfort against the winds tearing through the cardboard sheathing of the hall. When it seemed the entire building might collapse, the funeral bier was moved into the one-room cabin where Dennis Banks had lived the previous summer, and the mourners moved into the Jumping Bull residence, site of the bloody FBI-Indian shoot-out eight months before.</td>
