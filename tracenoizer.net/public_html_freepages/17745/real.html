 The one big difference between what they do and what we are doing here is they have a day rate for nonmembers and a different operating plan. I am in the process of incorporating several of the really good ideas into my business plan and will launch the changes on June 1st. A few of the immediate improvements are remodling the restroom with counter space, real sinks, and better lighting. The main range will have 6 benchrest tables for 100 yard shooting with dedicated target stands, 4 tables for 50 yard rifle shooting, 2 tables for 25 yard shooting and 6 offhand shooting positions at the extreme right side of the covered area. We are putting in a 25 yard bullet trap to keep bullets from skipping out of the range.</td>
