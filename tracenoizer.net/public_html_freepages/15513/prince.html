 Castle of Vlad Tepes Castle of Vlad Tepes Welcome to the Castle of Vlad Tepes, I am Izros, the caretaker of this castle. Feel free to walk about and learn about the Dracula family. Ignore the babblings of that Irish quack Bram Stoker and read about the legends that have overshadowed history and the true history of the Prince Dracula. He also liked to cut off noses, ears, sexual organs and limbs. But his favorite method was impalement on stakes, hence the surname "Tepes" which means "The Impaler" in the Romanian language.</td>

 This man single handedly impaled and cooked people to their miserable deaths. He lived from 1431 to 1476 and throughout his life he was ruler of Wallachia three different times. He was born in the Transylvania town of Sighisoara, son of the formidable Vlad Dracul, Prince of Wallachia. By 1462 the wrath of the Ottomans was felt in Wallachia. After death, however, Vlad assumed a definitive role in the legends of Romania, as wild rumors erupted about his demise and his corpse.</td>
