 Magyars make up the largest ethnic group in Hungary. The Carpathian Mountains and Transylvanian Alps separate the region from the rest of Romania. For years, Romanians and Hungarians quarreled over Transylvania. From 1526 to 1699, Transylvania was part of the Ottoman (Turkish) Empire. It was under Hungarian control from 1699 to 1867, when it once again became part of Hungary.</td>

 Many famous Hungarians, including actor Bela Lugosi and composer Bela Bartik were born in what in now Romanian Transylvania. . Generally better off than the south, Transylvania has some of Romania's most important cultural centers and verdant counrtyside. It's still hard to figure out exactly what is Transylvania. The mix of cultures and the thriving landscape make Transylvania an intriguing place.</td>

 Transylvania has a good starting point for this challenge and might be a future reference. . Due to the short time given, our Case Study Trip could not discover the whole situation of the society in Transylvania, but at least some, very different personal opinions of inhabitants. Aim of the trip was, of course, to get an understanding for problems what it means if people from different ethnic groups live together. But even more it was our concern, as the title of the Case Study Trip already defines 'Transylvania - an example for a multicultural society.</td>
