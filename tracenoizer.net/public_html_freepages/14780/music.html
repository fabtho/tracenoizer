The cover on the 14-tune release (from Good Dog Music) depicts Joe with his guitar, wearing bib overalls and what looks like a railroad engineer''s cap as he sits on the front porch of what appears to be an old farmhouse. His face is wide and plain as he stares out into the distance. Joe actually grew up on a hog farm in Secaucus, New Jersey.">

 He worked as a bus driver, a chimney sweep, and a vacuum cleaner salesman. and owns a garbage hauling company called Dumpster Man with his son. After accumulating a small repertoire, he began to perform his music live at open mic nights like the Turning Point in Piermont, N. I would see someone in a public bathroom six months later, and they would say, 'I remember you, you're the one who sang about the pig farms. According to my mom, they came from Eastern Europe.</td>

 Shot with long takes with black between frames, the film managed to keep viewers hooked until the end, no small feat for audiences accustomed to more frenetic cutting. A series titled Love Cinema, with six films by Japanese directors all addressing love in some manner, was included in the digital showcase, as were now classic DV entries such as Mike Figgis' "Time Code" and Wayne Wang's erotic "Center of the World. " The Music Department series included both "Wave Twisters" and "Scratch," as well as a collection of Berlin-based VJs and music video directors, and a documentary from the Netherlands on Nick Drake. The conference was less than thrilling, perhaps because the business side of the film industry is in such flux that comments tend to be about an ephemeral future. That said, the festival's attention to first-time directors and DV filmmaking makes it a treat indeed, and if it continues on this course, BerlinBeta will undoubtedly become a significant date on the more alternative festival circuit.</td>
