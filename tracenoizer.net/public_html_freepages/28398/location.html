 A variety of meteorological data (including winds, temperatures, thickness values, and stability indices) from that model for that location are then computed and displayed in a text box on the right side of the program window. .S (FOUS, or FRH) bulletins from NCEP has been an important tool for National Weather Service forecasters for the past 20 years, giving them a quick look at a subset of meteorological data from a forecast model for a particular location in or near their forecast area. With the implementation of the Advanced Weather Interpretation and Processing System (AWIPS), NWS forecasters now have a platform containing all available current weather and forecast model data, and the tools necessary to manipulate that data into any desired format. From this comes an AWIPS local application, developed at the National Weather Service in Sterling, Virginia, called FOUS Extractor.</td>
