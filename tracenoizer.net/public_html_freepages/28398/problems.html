"At the moment, we have a monthly reporting cycle, and the cycle can be very onerous," he says. "By the time we have all the reports together, it could be six to seven weeks after problems first arose. "Then that is incorporated into the schedule, updated and reissued on paper. Previously, project team members filled out paper time sheets that were later typed into a database, then exported to a different database to estimate progress against the project plan.</td>
