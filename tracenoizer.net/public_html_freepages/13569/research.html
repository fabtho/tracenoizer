 All Rights Reserved 16723434 page accesses since Feb. . Applications are invited for several postdoctoral research positions in computational and theoretical condensed matter physics. Current priorities are on Quantum Computing (Superconducting JJ Qubits), computational studies of vortex dynamics, and the dynamics of networks, although we are also working in other areas. RIKEN offers competitive salaries, and outstanding computational facilities.</td>
