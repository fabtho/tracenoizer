 If I've missed any please let me know These pages are maintained by Clare Warwick last updated on 11th May 1997 HERE'S THE BANISHED PAGE . . This project was undertaken as 1 - point Computer Science final year project. With the aim of surveying current methods in Quantum Computing and producing a HTML site showing the results of my endeavours. A large quantity of information on this subject is available on the Internet, links to other sites can be found on the WHERE NEXT.</td>
