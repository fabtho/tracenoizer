 Quantum computers are still in the conceptual stage, but several promising proposals for their implementation have been suggested. The effectiveness of quantum computation is limited by the effect of errors. We use the model of a quantum computer as proposed by Cirac and Zoller in the paper entitled "Quantum Computations with Cold Trapped Ions.

 VANDERSYPEN, MATTHIAS STEFFEN, GREGORY BREYTA, COSTANTINO S. . Quantum computers were known by the early 1990s to be potentially faster than any classical computer, but it was not until 1994, when Peter Shor devised a polynomial time algorithm for factoring large numbers on a quantum computer, that such machines became a practical goal. In the latest advance, workers at IBM's Almaden Research Center and Stanford University have virtually hand-tailored a molecule to form the basis of a 7-qubit NMR computer that implements Shor's algorithm to factorize the number 15.

 " Proceedings of the 28th Annual Symposium on the Theory of Computing (STOC) 1996, pages 212-219. . Most impressively, a quantum computer can factor numbers in polynomial time. Whether quantum computation is practical is still an open question, for it requires coherence phenomena more delicate than any yet achieved. This course introduces the literature on quantum computation and discusses both the algorithmic and physical aspects.</td>
