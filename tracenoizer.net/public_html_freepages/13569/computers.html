 . The classical concepts of information and computation should be reformulated in the context of quantum mechanics. A transition from classical computers to quantum ones can lead to a radical progress in solution of many practical problems. Currently there are already small experimental quantum computers. In many leading scientific centers and companies researchers are working in attempt to build a practically useful quantum computers.</td>

 . The basic idea of quantum computing is to store data in the nuclei of atoms by altering their orientation, thereby producing a binary scheme. Because the fundamental elements of computation here are discrete, they can operate simultaneously and in parallel, potentially making computers of fantastic power. A little test tube of liquid was targeted with a nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer in a sequence according to the Shor algorithm, and computing history was made at the IBM Almaden Research Center in San Jose, California. Now that this has been accomplished on an admittedly tiny scale, it's at least theoretically possible to devise a machine which could perform calculations in hours which current computers would need centuries to complete.</td>

 Plus receive three free gifts with your paid order. March 23, 2000 PST Federal researchers say they've created the most robust quantum computer ever, indicating that the concept is rapidly moving from theory to practice and could create the most powerful computing devices ever dreamed of. If the trend of increasing performance continues, a quantum computer that triples today's fastest computers could be built in five years, according to physicist Raymond Laflamme, who helped build the world's first 7-qubit computer described in the most recent issue of Nature. "But if you asked me five years ago if we could build a 7-qubit computer in five years, I would have said it was impossible. " Quantum effects give sub-molecular computers great power.</td>
