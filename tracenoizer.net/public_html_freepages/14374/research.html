 In 1995, I received my undergraduate degree in biology from Howard University. I completed work for my Masters degree while here at SUNY, Stony Brook. For my Masters, I conducted research in a montane rainforest in southeastern Madagascar at Ranomafana National Park. thesis is to quantify ecosystem-level consequences of plant invasions. Linking changes in ecosystem function to the presence of particular plant invader is difficult.</td>

 The basic explanation of how you go about climbing is that you shoot a thin line up around a sturdy branch, then thread your rope around the branch, and then you climb the rope. Deedra had been known to spend all night, over 12 hours, in a tree helping a student do a project. Although OTS students were climbing for fun at Las Cruces, we were also working hard analyzing and writing up the results of the brief research projects that we had been doing for the last two months on the course. Many thanks to the Las Cruces staff for making our stay productive and fun. .</td>
