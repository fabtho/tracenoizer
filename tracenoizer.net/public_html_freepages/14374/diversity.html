<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" . graduate students in the Ecology and Evolution Program al Gharaibeh, Waleed S. edu I am interested in the evolution of biological and cultural diversity of human populations in the East Mediterranean. Specifically, I am attempting to apply comparative method techniques, in conjunction with geometric morphometrics and spatial statistics, in investigating the relationships between environmental variables (including mode-of-subsistence and diet) and human morphology (while accounting for covariation due to history). I am planning to employ a similar approach in investigating the relationship between cultural and genetic variation patterns in order to determine the extent and frequency of acculturation and, ultimately, its contribution to the formation of ethnic groups.">

 Three years ago he created the Tzu Chi Institute for Complementary and Alternative Medicine in Vancouver BC. He spends most of his time with children as the Professor of Pediatrics in the Faculty of Medicine, University of BC and the Director of the Centre for Complementary Medicine Research at the BC Research Institute for Children's and Women's Health. Tze is honoured to be here to work with a room full of individuals with broad expertise and diversity regarding the field of NHPs. He is interested in making this new Canadian venture become a reality and to assist the Office in achieving its objectives. He expressed his wish to have the EAC work well together as a team and he is very keen to be able to help ONHP achieve international recognition to enhance the credibility of the Office.</td>
