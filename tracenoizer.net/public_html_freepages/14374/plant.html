 I completed work for my Masters degree while here at SUNY, Stony Brook. For my Masters, I conducted research in a montane rainforest in southeastern Madagascar at Ranomafana National Park. thesis is to quantify ecosystem-level consequences of plant invasions. Linking changes in ecosystem function to the presence of particular plant invader is difficult. Evidenced by the lack of quantitative studies on this subject.</td>

 The relative impacts and interactions between galling, deer browsing, and fire on C. herbaceous growth and architecture were investigated by comparing numbers of shoots, buds, and inflorescences; bud vitality; and herbivory rates between plants on an annually burned and an infrequently burned watershed. herbaceous growth patterns, reducing the number of shoots per ramet, increasing ramets per plant and shoot length, and preventing sexual reproduction. The effects of herbivory were much weaker than those of fire. Galling rate was higher on the infrequently burned watershed.</td>
