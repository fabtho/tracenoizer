 herbaceous growth and architecture were investigated by comparing numbers of shoots, buds, and inflorescences; bud vitality; and herbivory rates between plants on an annually burned and an infrequently burned watershed. herbaceous growth patterns, reducing the number of shoots per ramet, increasing ramets per plant and shoot length, and preventing sexual reproduction. The effects of herbivory were much weaker than those of fire. Galling rate was higher on the infrequently burned watershed. Galled ramets had shorter shoots but increased numbers of shoots and inflorescences than ungalled ramets.</td>

 The objective of my PhD thesis project is to study patterns in resistance to different plant enemies, using Rapid-cyling Brassica rapa (Brassicaceae) as a model system. My work explores the influences of atmospheric nitrogen deposition (anthropogenically-derived fixed nitrogen compounds which are deposited onto plant and soil surfaces) on plant physiology, growth, and reproduction. I am exploring both the direct effects of N deposition on plants (that is, those effects due to increased availability of fixed nitrogen) and more indirect effects of N deposition (deposition-induced changes in interactions between plants and their insect herbivores). I am exploring these interactions through experimental work in the SUNYSB greenhouse, field experiments at Brookhaven National Laboratory on eastern Long Island, and computer modeling work. I am interested in aggressive competition while foraging in non-human primates.</td>
