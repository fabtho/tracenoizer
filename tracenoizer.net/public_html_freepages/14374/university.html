 Specifically, I am attempting to apply comparative method techniques, in conjunction with geometric morphometrics and spatial statistics, in investigating the relationships between environmental variables (including mode-of-subsistence and diet) and human morphology (while accounting for covariation due to history). I am planning to employ a similar approach in investigating the relationship between cultural and genetic variation patterns in order to determine the extent and frequency of acculturation and, ultimately, its contribution to the formation of ethnic groups.
