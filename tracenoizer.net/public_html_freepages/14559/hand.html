 So I picked a relatively low price of six swap points and got an offer the same day. I then used those points to snag a Tracy Chapman CD from someone else. WebSwap, on the other hand, lets folks mail one another directly. It's the biggest barter site on the Web, with people hawking everything from a half-full bottle of Prell to a flock of sheep. I listed a dozen items, including the latest Patricia Cornwell thriller, a Beatles CD and three "Star Trek" movies, but for some reason I couldn't manage a single trade in a month.</td>

 Optionally, you can apply constraints and vary the output as explained below. Swapping suits is useful to apply the settings of one suit to two or more. If this option is chosen, you cannot modify the other hand of the same side. If the seed is left blank, the generator will be seeded randomly by an outside source and the deals cannot be reproduced. See also my Bidding Practice Dealer for creating just two hands, and my article on Randomization Techniques if you are interested in how these programs work.</td>
