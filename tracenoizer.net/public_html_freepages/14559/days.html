 But charging after each use increases battery life. Should the batteries be emptied, it will require an over night charge to bring them up to capacity. Never charge for more than two days as an over charge may blow the internal limit fuse in the Charger. ..</td>

 But the captain remains unlikely to return to the Rangers' lineup at least until the playoffs, should the Rangers qualify. . Glen Sather went to two familiar wells to replenish his team in the days and hours before Tuesday's trade deadline -- one he unabashedly still admires and another that he long decried. The former is the Edmonton pipeline he built and maintained for a quarter-century (the one he has tapped to restaff almost his entire coaching, scouting and front-office departments). Just before the deadline, Sather struck a deal with protege Kevin Lowe to acquire potential-laden defenseman Tom Poti and versatile forward Rem Murray at the steep cost of heart-and-soul forward Mike York.</td>

 When I was 22, I moved on a whim to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, to live with a guy who worked on a party boat. Just four years ago, I cold-called my way into a job at TIME. These days, I can't even drop a letter in a corner mailbox without double checking to make sure it went down the chute. Perhaps that's why I'm so leery of online auctions. I am worried that if I start fooling around on eBay, I'll end up getting ripped off or selling to someone who never pays up.</td>
