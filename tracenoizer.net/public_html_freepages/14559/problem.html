At the Rangers' prompting, Bure first made a call to Adam Graves to see if he would be offended. 9 with distinction for 10 years with the Rangers before being dealt to San Jose last summer Characteristically, the selfless Graves said he had no problem at all. But Sather's explanation was that Poti is simply a far better defenseman than many of his current ones -- most of whom, he acquired or signed as free agents, by the way. Rather than focus on the lack of physicality and defensive posture of his defensemen, Sather pointed to an inability to move the puck out of the defensive zone -- particularly a doomed penchant by some for trying to ring the puck behind the net and out the other side.">
