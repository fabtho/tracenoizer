 . You may order it now and we will ship it to you when it arrives. Editorial Reviews Book Description This book provides a wide-ranging and unique insight into the legal system of a country which is at the forefront of global development, yet rarely examined by legal scholars. It is a major contribution to the study of comparative law and through its multidisciplinary approach breaks new ground in providing a comprehensive text on the subject. Through its approachable yet scholarly style it provides the reader with an outline of the essentials of the legal system, whilst at the same time providing an historical and cultural context from which they will be able to develop an informed critique.</td>
