If you provide methods with these names in a public, creatable class, the Add-In Manager creates an instance of that object and invokes the ConnectAddIn method when the add-in is loaded. End Sub The Application argument is a passed-in reference to the current instance of the Visual Basic Application object. This reference is your one opportunity to access the Application object, so you must use this reference to derive all subsequent object references in your add-in.</td>

 The methods add listeners for the components and arrange them in column(s) in the order that they are called. The current column is a PiPanel named "panel", which may be manipulated directly in gui() as needed. If a method named var_changed exists, it is called; otherwise, click() is called as the default event handler. Finally, all graphical components are updated to reflect the new values of all the variables. A large collection of mathematical functions are provided in this class, so that subclasses need not prefix them (e.</td>
