 The conference had been eagerly awaited for quite some time, as Sun executives had been alluding to a major storage announcement as early as last summer. Especially because of Sun's current storage position as fourth in a three horse race, I was curious as to how they've drummed up so much attention. Sun's storage group announced new mid-range products to fill in its hardware line, but the software announcements were more interesting. In an otherwise lackluster investing environment, eyes continue to be on the growing storage bubble, with particular regard to hyped features such as virtualization, which have already become commoditized before many companies even have product. The winners will be companies such as Vicom, which is providing the virtualization engine for Sun's StoreEdge 6900 Series.</td>
