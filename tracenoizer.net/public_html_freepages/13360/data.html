 The DFS for ANTU commenced operations with the Call for Proposals for the first VLT semester on 1 August, 1998. . The VLT Data Flow System (DFS) is being designed and implemented by the DFS Group in collaboration with VLT Division and Instrumentation Division. Below you will find a brief summary of the operational aspects and of the components of the DFS system. More complete and up-to-date information can be found on the DFS Group website.</td>

 A GPS (Global Positioning System) is used and the data are recorded in synchronization with the results from the multi-parameter sonde by a data logger. . The system provided not only high quality data but made it possible to map these parameters while the boat is in transit. The submergible pump is a small marine bilge pump attached to a steel pipe that is mounted and anchored on the side of the boat. To maintain the specified flow requirements for the different sensors and to maintain a steady flow of seawater to the flow chamber and the chlorophyll a sensor in series, a simple constant-head device is used instead of throttling valves.</td>
