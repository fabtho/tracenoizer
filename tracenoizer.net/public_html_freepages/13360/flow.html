 The Dye Flow System is powered by 380 VAC, 50 Hz, 3-phases. . Dye Flow System CW Dye Laser Dye Flow System The Dye Flow System contains all the components necessary to produce the high-quality and the very stable jet of the dye. In the Dye Flow System is used of stainless steel and synthetic materials which not interact with the laser dyes and the solvents. The filter, the heat exchanger (jacket cooling) and the smooter (air buffer) are combined in one device.</td>
