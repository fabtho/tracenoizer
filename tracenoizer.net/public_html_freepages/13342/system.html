 Join the eighth annual lean forum presented by a leader in lean education, The University of Michigan, for a concentrated learning experience in the fundamental knowledge you need to get on and stay on track.

Ken is only the second Chief Production Engineer, a new role at Toyota building on their famous Chief Engineer system to bring the voice of manufacturing to the earliest styling stage. For the first time Mike will share publicly his lessons learned from this experience. And that's where many struggle to gain the benefits of lean.</td>
