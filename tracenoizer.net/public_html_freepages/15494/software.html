 . Broadly defined, a Web service is a method of making various applications communicate with each other automatically over the Internet. The goal is to streamline business processes by allowing software applications to be delivered over the Internet and run across all kinds of computers, from large servers to handheld devices. But explaining just how that fits into a corporate IT department's development plans, or how consumers will ultimately end up using Web services, can be difficult, judging from remarks made by show attendees and speakers. "It's hard to tell whether customers just don't have the money to invest in Web services or whether they don't know how they would implement it," Morgan said.</td>
