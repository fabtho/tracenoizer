 . However, major improvements have been made to simplify use, increase reliability and reduce manpower requirements. All major subsystems of the RSG, including the gravity sensor, electronics and data system, may be controlled remotely via computer modem. Additionally, changes have been made to the design and operation of the instrument which eliminate the need for highly-trained personnel to be present at the remote site in order to set up and operate the instrument. To begin operation, the instrument is first moved to the remote site of operation, set in place and roughly leveled using two micrometers.</td>
