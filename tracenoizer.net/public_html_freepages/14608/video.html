 The original tape was a recording of the titular act. Signed and numbered from an edition of only 20 examples. Dean's video work has concerned itself with the medium's relationship with reality. A typical YBA's (Young British Artist's) fascination with dissection. Again he original tape was a recording of the titular act.</td>
