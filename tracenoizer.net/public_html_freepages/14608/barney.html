 I remember thinking that this was some of the most interesting work I had seen in a while especially in the medium of video. It was hard to pin down in a art climate awash in politically charged work that seemed to shun with a vengeance poetry or ambiguity. I had not a clue as to what Barney was up to in these works, but it looked great and suggested some strange sexual tensions. Of course this is a great subject of the dark side of the American dream and Mailer handled it exceedingly well on the page. Barney in the past has survived these indulgences because his work has been exactly about melodrama and baroque visual effects.</td>
