 In 1989, he graduated from Yale University, New Haven. His singular vision foregrounds the physical rigors of sport and its erotic undercurrents to explore the limits of the body and sexuality. Broadcast on Dutch television and screened at several film festivals, Cremaster 4 (1994) and Cremaster 1 (1995) are the first two videos produced in a projected series of five that allegorize the stages in the sexual differentiation of an embryo. The Museum Boymans-van Beuningen, Rotterdam, organized a solo exhibition of his work that toured Europe throughout 1995 and 1996. Barney lives in New York and is currently at work on Cremaster 5, the third installment of his video cycle to be produced.</td>
