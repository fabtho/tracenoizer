 One well-known article by Neville Wakefield was portentously titled "Matthew Barney's Fornication with Space and Time". This alone is enough to make this artist's work a fitting subject for Bad Subjects' special issue on "Men, Women and Everyone Else". Certainly, the "everyone else" is evidenced in the Cremaster films by characters that either have no genitalia or have oddly sculpted genitals which, both as shapes and what appear to be organs, are something completely and freakishly different from the standard male or female packages. But there is a problem with this seductive and tellingly selective view of Barney's project, one that I expect is true of the entire discourse about real and mythical gender mutation. When most people interpret the psychological implications and significance of Barney's fascinations, they sacrifice their potential for uncanny revelation in favor of a new kind of spectacle-for-the-sake-of-spectacle, which in Wakefield's words, ".</td>

 Composer Jonathan Bepler provides the original musical score for the film, with vocals by Steve Tucker of Morbid Angel and Patty Griffin. The film is screened in a sculptural installation in the gallery that includes a nylon cabinet with saline saturated barbells, a model of a mountain range sculpted in salt, a mirrored riding saddle, and a suite of portrait photographs of glaciers. The development of Barney's unique mythological vision can be seen most clearly in his series of Cremaster films, which have been his primary artistic focus since 1994. In 1993 he won the Europa 2000 award at the 45th Venice Biennale and in 1996 received the first annual Hugo Boss Award from the Solomon R. The exhibition is accompanied by a catalogue with an essay by Walker Chief Curator Richard Flood and full-color reproductions.</td>
