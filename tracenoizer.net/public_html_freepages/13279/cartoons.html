 The petition scripts are created by Mike Wheeler at Artifice, Inc. . Cartoons, the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies, are as famous and beloved as the classic movies mentioned above - maybe more so. And yet they haven't received the attention, and the restoration, that many of these other films have received. The importance of preserving these classic cartoons cannot be understated.</td>
