 Many of Avery's cartoons went uncredited, some were finished after he left a studio and many were re-titled or re-edited. In fact Avery himself was unsure of exact titles and even the existence of some cartoons, but it's hardly surprising when you think that he made over 200 films in under two decades. Indenting in bold marks the first appearance (or naming) of the character. ..</td>

 . Known as The Man of 1,000 Voices, Blanc's voice as these cartoon characters became instantly recognizable to generations of children starting with the golden era of Merrie Melodies cartoons by Warner Brothers. character was a drunken bull in the 1937 Looney Tunes short Picador Porky. As legend has it, the actor playing Porky Pig in that short actually did stutter. Blanc took over the role in Porky's Duck Hunt, stuttering intact, and created Daffy Duck at the same time.</td>
