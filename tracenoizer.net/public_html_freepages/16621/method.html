 This is because the number of times this reduction can recursively go on is the number of times n can be divided by m and still be larger than 1. Suppose the time required to reduce the problem and combine the result is f(n). Merge sort is the application of this recursive divide-and-conquer method to sorting. The idea is to divide the list into two halves, recursively apply the same method to each half, and then merge the sorted halves into a sorted list. This is the top-down or recursive view of merge sort.</td>

 Your comparison function should take two pointers to Tuples, and return -1, 0, or 1 in the manner of strcmp. After calling qsort, write the sorted run out to a temporary heap file. To write the run out, simply create a new HeapFile object with a unique name, and repeatedly call the insertRecord method. The fact that all the records are the same size means that the HeapFile will maintain your sorted order. You will not need to keep track of the pages that are pinned and unpinned, but the idea is that only one page needs to be dirtied at a time.</td>

Grammatical-Historical Hermeneutics For Lay Readers Grammatical-Historical Hermeneutics For Lay Readers By Gary DeLashmutt and Dennis McCallum Interpret Grammatically, Historically and Critically Interpreting grammatically The historical-critical method assumes that words and expressions have a relatively stable meaning during given periods of history. In other words, our interpretation must correspond to the words and grammar in the text in a reasonable way. Otherwise, the interpreter could assign meaning of his own without objective control.</td>
