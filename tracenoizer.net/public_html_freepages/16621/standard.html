The yarn is then dyed in a variety of colors using either vegetal material such as insects and roots or modern chemicals. Atiyeh International's weaving centers use standard chemical dyes in an enclosed retort so colors are always even and color-fast. The basic foundation of all Oriental rugs is the warp which can be cotton or wool. We use cotton warp to maintain uniform tension on the loom keeping our rugs straight when they are completed.">
