 Oriental rugs are made using a variety of weaving and knotting techniques. Our weavers use a Persian or Senneh knot for strength and clarity in the curvilinear designs. Atiyeh's rugs are hand-woven at our Chinese weaving centers in Hebei and Shandong Provinces. Tribal rugs usually do not require a pre-drawn design, but complicated workshop rugs are designed prior to weaving. Because our designs are very detailed, each rug has its own diagram, which we refer to as the cartoon.</td>

 .cs541 lecture 10-17-96 CS 541-002 (Cheng) Class Note 10-17-96 How Humans Sort The purpose of sorting a list is mainly for easy retrieval later. Think about sorting a hand of playing cards, a shelf of books, or a deck of recipe cards. Sorting must be an ancient algorithm that our ancesters performed for thousands of years. Sorting a hand of cards is usually done by inserting new cards into an already sorted hand of cards.</td>

 If PATTERSON is specified all amplitudes are squared (after all scaling, checking etc. The symmetry of the spacegroup is used to generate the appropriate Patterson symmetry, and this is checked against the symmetry of the FFTSPACEGROUP. If the maximum peak in the phased translation map is high (typically greater than 50 RMS), then for hand 1 the model corresponding to PHI2 will need to be moved by this amount to overlap the model corresponding to PHI. If HAND 2 is specified, the model corresponding to PHI2 will need to be inverted then moved. The items SIG1 and SIG2 are used to check the validity of the F for a reflection.</td>
