 If t matches with an existing tuple in the partition, then recompute the aggregate. If t is not same as the existing tuple, then insert it into the current partition. process-sortrun(t) If t starts a new sorted run, flush all its pages and start a new sorted run. If t matches with the last tuple then recompute aggregate. If t does not match the last tuple, append tuple to the end of the existing run.</td>

 External Sorting External Sorting Section 3 - Selection Replacement Algorithm Edited by Zhihui Zhang Having reviewed heap operations, we are now ready to take a look at the algorithm used to create runs as long as possible. The replacement selection algorithm can be implemented by dividing a single array of buffer into two back-to-back areas. The first area is a heap storing keys for those records to be put into the current run. The second area stores keys for those records waiting to be put into the next run. You have to understand this in order to appreciate the elegance of the following distribution function.</td>

 You do need a superior mmap() implementation for this. overview files need to be sorted (they usually are). overview files aren't sorted, run this script occasionally to get them sorted again. It's (of course) a perl script, use the -v switch to see what's happening, or no switch at all to run from crontab. Here's the patch Additionally, here is a program to stress-test your mmap() implementation.</td>
