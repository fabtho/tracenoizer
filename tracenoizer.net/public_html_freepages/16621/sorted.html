For some cuboid, it may be possible to allocate only one page, and they are marked in SortRun state. When a cuboid is in Parition state, its tuples can be pipelined for computing teh descendent cuboids in the same pass, while for the cuboids with SortRun state, the page is used to write out sorted runs for this cuboid on disk. A cuboid can be considered for computation if either its parent is the root of the subtree or the parent has been marked as being in the partition state. The total memory allocated to all the cuboids should not be more than available memory.">

 Think about sorting a hand of playing cards, a shelf of books, or a deck of recipe cards. Sorting must be an ancient algorithm that our ancesters performed for thousands of years. Sorting a hand of cards is usually done by inserting new cards into an already sorted hand of cards. If the hand is already sorted, a log n binary search can locate the insertion position. ) When the number of cards is large, for example, in the case when you are to sort n years' TV guide magazine in the chronological order.</td>

overview files, and binary search them for a very big speed improvement, especially for sites with a lot of readers. You do need a superior mmap() implementation for this. overview files need to be sorted (they usually are). overview files aren't sorted, run this script occasionally to get them sorted again. It's (of course) a perl script, use the -v switch to see what's happening, or no switch at all to run from crontab.</td>

 41 seconds, beating the old record by more than a full second. The more interesting challenge was MinuteSort; how much data can you sort in one minute of elapsed time. The biggest challenge came from Ordinal Technologies, whose commercially available nSort program sorted 5 GB in under one minute on the 1997 SGI Origin machine. Their work earned them the commercial MinuteSort trophy, known as the "Daytona" award. For more details about these benchmarks, visit the Sort Benchmark page.</td>
