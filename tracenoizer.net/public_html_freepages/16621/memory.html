 NOW-Sort competes for the Indy trophy; that is, sorting programs that are not commercially supported products. The Daytona award goes to the fastest commercial product. NOW-Sort is a collection of sorting implementations on a cluster of Sun workstations connected with a high-speed Myrinet switch, and is adaptable to the number of available processors, the amount of main memory, and the number and the relative speed of the local disks. The parallel implementations of NOW-Sort are built on top of two key pieces of NOW technology, Active Messages and Glunix. The basic algorithm when all records fit in the collective memory of the workstations is as follows.</td>

 After reading a page into a buffer pool frame (using the pinpage call), you should cast it into an object of the HFPage class. This will allow you to operate on the records on the page through the methods of HFPage. Let the amount of memory that is given be SORTPGNUM pages. Sort this set of records by calling the qsort library function. Your call to qsort will take a pointer to your sorting area, the number of records contained therein, the size of each record, and a pointer to your comparison function.</td>

 In the first stage, each distributor node runs a distributor process that disseminates the collection of Web pages to the indexers. Each indexer receives a mutually disjoint subset of pages and their associated identifiers. The indexers parse and extract postings from the pages, sort the postings in memory, and flush them to intermediate structures on disk. In the second stage, these intermediate structures are merged together to create one or more inverted files and their associated lexicons. An (inverted file, lexicon) pair is generated by merging a subset of the sorted runs.</td>
