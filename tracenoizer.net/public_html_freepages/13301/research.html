 The BTR Programme will sponsor the most promising ideas across the range of basic technology rather than referring to any preset allocations between the Councils or the different disciplines. . Dr John Taylor, OBE, FEng, FRS Director General of Research Councils The Basic Technology Research Programme is strategically important for the UK. It is designed to create fundamental new capabilities which will form the basis for industries of the future. Whilst basic science research is about acquiring new understanding, basic technology research is about acquiring new capability.</td>
