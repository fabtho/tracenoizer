 Ray Holt will be speaking at Cal Poly University - Pomona, CA on January 8, 2002. The MOS-LSI chips were manufactured by American Microsystems, Inc of Santa Clara, California. The MOS-LSI chip set was part of the Central Air Data Computer (CADC) which had the function of controlling the moving surfaces of the aircraft and the displaying of pilot information. The output of the CADC controlled the moving surfaces of the aircraft. These were the wings, maneuver flaps, and the glove vane controls.</td>

 It is planned that the system will have a control framework and will provide course management, course delivery, feedback for staff and students and intelligent educational conferencing. . Learning Technology Research Learning Technology Research The Learning Technology Research Group was set up within the Department of Computer Science at Nottingham University to research into the use of computer technology to support education. The group's research interests cover areas such as Computer Aided Learning, assessment mechanisms, collaborative learning environments and course management systems. The most significant development to emerge from the group to date has been the Ceilidh and the CourseMaster systems.</td>
