 The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) Implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) began on January 1, 1994. This agreement will remove most barriers to trade and investment among the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Under the NAFTA, all nontariff barriers to agricultural trade between the United States and Mexico were eliminated. In addition, many tariffs were eliminated immediately, with others being phased out over periods of 5 to 15 years. All agricultural provisions will be implemented by the year 2008.</td>

 We're also known as National Farmers and by our initials NFO. We're a unique American general farm organization located in Ames, Iowa. Our specialized mission is to improve agricultural commodity prices by serving as a bargaining agent for our members. Because of that narrowly defined mission, the National Farmers Organization provides services offered by no other major agricultural group. National Farmers members are proudly reaping the benefits of the organization's more than 45 years of experience marketing together to extract the dollars farmers need to pay their bills.</td>
