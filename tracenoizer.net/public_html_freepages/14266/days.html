<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" Anyway, Karen was also an outspoken feminist and we even started to garner a hardcore-feminist-punk following of sorts, some group of women called the Fester Girls, out here in california. Regardless, Karen definately deserves to be on your page as Karen was a groundbreaker of sorts. There werent a whole lot of women fronting hardcore bands in those days, Sin34 being about the only exception i can recall (legal weapon was considered kinda arty, and the avengers were not hardcore). Karen used to get a lot of shit and I remember some knarly guy slamming her pretty hard in Denver one night. The punks paid a lot of lip service to equality but when it came down to it a lot of them were macho assholes who could not handle having a woman on stage singing to them their atrocities.">

 "Parents of first- and second-graders may be more cautious about sending a child away from home," she says. "They enjoy the feel of a day camp, because they can have daily interaction with the people supervising their children. They can vary in length from a few days to usually no more than four weeks. Privately owned resident camps are normally not cheap, but overnight camps run by public agencies such as the YMCA (see directory) are more moderately priced. However, sessions at these camps are normally much shorter in length than the private resident camps.</td>
