 It was a harcore outfit, we had one LP "last hour" on the Placebo label (JFA, Sun City Girls, etc) and also contributed to a Placebo compilation record called "this is phoenix not the circle jerks". KZSU doesnt have the record (come to think i havent checked for the comp) but KALX has both and plays conflict cuts off them about once every couple of years (at least that i hear, and it always gives me a jolt. Nurse aka Karen Allman (she was head psychiatric nurse at the public hospital in Tucson). She also wrote all the lyrics (I would bring music to practice and she would bring a book of poems and instantly put them to work). Man she was a tough one too, she was half japanese.</td>
