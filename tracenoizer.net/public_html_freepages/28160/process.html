 . We acknowledge that the opportunity to compete for "initiative" funding has induced some campus units to reflect differently on unmet needs and future possibilities, and that this new thought has been good for the campus as a whole. Over the past two years, however, the detrimental aspects of the Initiatives Process have become increasingly apparent. We regret to report that, as presently implemented, the Initiatives Process has taken the place of rational campus planning, and threatens to become its very antithesis. CPB has long believed that a limited portion of the campus budget should be set aside for meritorious and innovative projects that may fall outside the immediate priorities and plans of the powers that be.</td>

 There are implications for monitoring programs, and we should all seek opportunities for collaboration among our Great Lakes organizations to adjust our monitoring programs to support the indicators. . The Process - Future Slide 27 of 30 Although we will bring closure to the SOLEC98 Indicators List, we anticipate that there will be continuing evaluation of the indicators, development of new ones, and research to better understand the Great Lakes ecosystem. Also, the creation of a SOLEC Indicators list will be an empty exercise if no efforts are made to collect the attending data.

 Timmons By the way, the great leveling effect of the listserver could perhaps be useful in more participatory decisionmaking during the periods between business meetings at the ASA. . However I am glad to see some of these issues finally being raised about PEWS's process and direction. As someone who had hoped to submit a paper to Al Bergeson's session I was very disappointed it was cancelled. I had been asking for an environment session in PEWS for the past three or four years at PEWS business meetings at ASA.</td>
