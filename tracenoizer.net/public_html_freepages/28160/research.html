 There are implications for monitoring programs, and we should all seek opportunities for collaboration among our Great Lakes organizations to adjust our monitoring programs to support the indicators. . The Process - Future Slide 27 of 30 Although we will bring closure to the SOLEC98 Indicators List, we anticipate that there will be continuing evaluation of the indicators, development of new ones, and research to better understand the Great Lakes ecosystem. Also, the creation of a SOLEC Indicators list will be an empty exercise if no efforts are made to collect the attending data. There are implications for monitoring programs, and we should all seek opportunities for collaboration among our Great Lakes organizations to adjust our monitoring programs to support the indicators.</td>

 In this period, it was necessarily self-absorbed, and the title "Political Economy of the World-System" was reflective of that narcissism. Now, however, the initial phase of narrow self-definition is past. Research has exploded into a myriad of specific areas scattered across disciplines. Put simply, World-System Theory has been moving from being itself the SUBJECT of research to being a TOOL of research. In the latter capacity, ALL subjects become fair game.</td>

 The analogy that has been used to describe this situation is that you are driving along on the Autobahn in a Mercedes at 100 miles per hour and somebody asks you to change all four tires. The race toward market dominance will be won by those companies that can change the tires of a moving car. 3 The Information Spine Research and development organizations have been challenged to increase efficiency in order to get more NCEs on the market while holding down costs. The critical ingredients for increased efficiency include information technology tools to improve the decision-making process, allow organization-wide collaboration and an underlying information spine to enable easy access to multiple sources of data. They have become geographically dispersed, either as part of large multi-national corporations, or through collaborative research.</td>
