 Creation of futures is necessary for some uses of multiple-value-call. . A natural way to accommodate this problem is by modifying the implementation of futures so that one future object returns (or resolves to) multiple values instead of one. We first show how a such straightforward modification fails to maintain the crucial characteristic of futures, namely that inserting futures in a functional program does not alter the the result of the computation. A straightforward modification may result in wrong number of values.</td>

 There are implications for monitoring programs, and we should all seek opportunities for collaboration among our Great Lakes organizations to adjust our monitoring programs to support the indicators. . The Process - Future Slide 27 of 30 Although we will bring closure to the SOLEC98 Indicators List, we anticipate that there will be continuing evaluation of the indicators, development of new ones, and research to better understand the Great Lakes ecosystem. Also, the creation of a SOLEC Indicators list will be an empty exercise if no efforts are made to collect the attending data. There are implications for monitoring programs, and we should all seek opportunities for collaboration among our Great Lakes organizations to adjust our monitoring programs to support the indicators.</td>
