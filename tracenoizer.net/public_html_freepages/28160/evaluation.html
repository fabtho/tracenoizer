The future special form returns a placeholder, called a future, to the process that called the future. When the evaluation of form completes and the value is determined, we say that the future has resolved.

The Process - Future Slide 27 of 30 Although we will bring closure to the SOLEC98 Indicators List, we anticipate that there will be continuing evaluation of the indicators, development of new ones, and research to better understand the Great Lakes ecosystem. Also, the creation of a SOLEC Indicators list will be an empty exercise if no efforts are made to collect the attending data.
