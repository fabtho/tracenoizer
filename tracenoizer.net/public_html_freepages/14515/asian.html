 That is why I have worked so hard as an Assemblyman on behalf of the Vietnamese people -- both here in California and in Vietnam. A few months later, I went to Vietnam - at my own expense - to try to win the freedom for Jimmy Tran and nine other Vietnamese American political prisoners. This past spring I sponsored the Southeast Asian Genocide Remembrance Week to call attention to the suffering of the people of Vietnam and other nations under the communists. On April 30, I wrote President Clinton, again asking him to help win freedom for Jimmy Tran and nine other Vietnamese American political prisoners. I have also been working to bring home Binh Tran, another political prisoner, who daughter lives in Anaheim.</td>
