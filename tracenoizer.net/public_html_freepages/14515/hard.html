 The Korean War was his hardest experience, as it pained him much to leave his family behind and travel over seas to fight the communists, but he believed in his country and the obligation to fight and defeat the north Koreans and their communist allies. During his time in the military he was trained to aid, serve and protect the innocent civilians. During the war Philip was involved in several hard fought struggles and incidents that marked him forever. The family was not well of before the war, and after the war the family's situation didn't improve as Philip had trouble to find work. He spent much time at the Unitarian shelters so that his family could use the little money he had.</td>
