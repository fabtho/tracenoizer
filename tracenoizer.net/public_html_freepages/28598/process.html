 Some Elementary Questions on Software Quality Control, Software Engineering Journal, November 1990. . As a consequence, the software process is becoming more and more important for permanent employees, long-term practitioners, and short-term consultant in the software industry. A process may be defined as a method of doing or producing something. Extending this to the specific case of software, we can say that a software process is a method of developing or producing software.</td>

 . Thayer The creation of quality software on time and within budget has been a major problem facing the software industry for several decades. Consideration of software development and maintenance as an engineering discipline to control the developmental process can help alleviate these obstacles. This new book focuses on the best practices for software process improvement (SPI) and related international standards providing a valuable guide and reference. The text is a collection of original and republished papers providing a significant survey on the use of SPI and software process assessment (SPA) as practiced by companies such as Lockheed Martin, Siemens, and Hewlett Packard.</td>

 The roadmap indicates what is possible and often potential rewards (points of interest). It does not dictate how (the route to take), where to stop (gas stations, tourism centers,. To begin your software business or quality improvement journey, it is best to first assure yourself and your clients that you are effectively managing your core process (i. , the software life cycle) and its supporting functions. To do this, consider achieving the ISO 9001 requirements.</td>
