 Department of Defense and operated by Carnegie Mellon University. . Humphrey Building High Performance Teams Using Team Software ProcessSM (TSPSM) and Personal Software ProcessSM (PSPSM) High Performance Teams To have a high-performance software organization you must have high performance teams, staffed with high-performance software engineers. While the Capability Maturity Model (CMM) focuses on what organizations should do, it does not specify how to reach those goals. The PSP provides specific guidance on how individual engineers can continually improve their performance.</td>
