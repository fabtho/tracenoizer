 Department of Defense and operated by Carnegie Mellon University. . Humphrey Building High Performance Teams Using Team Software ProcessSM (TSPSM) and Personal Software ProcessSM (PSPSM) High Performance Teams To have a high-performance software organization you must have high performance teams, staffed with high-performance software engineers. While the Capability Maturity Model (CMM) focuses on what organizations should do, it does not specify how to reach those goals. The PSP provides specific guidance on how individual engineers can continually improve their performance.</td>

 SECOND LAW ANALYSIS OF ADSORPTION CYCLES SECOND LAW ANALYSIS OF ADSORPTION CYCLES WITH THERMAL REGENERATION M. Abstract Adsorption processes can be used for operating environment-friendly refrigeration cycles. When combined with the thermal regeneration process, these cycles can have quite high performance. The second law analysis of the adsorption cycles with thermal regeneration is fully developed. The entropy balance is then completely established.</td>
