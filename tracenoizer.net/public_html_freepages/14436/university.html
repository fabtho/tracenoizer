Andrea is not only a Lun Fan addict, but also the company hairstylist. Wendy Lucas had studied Scenic Design at SUNY Purchase for two years when she transferred to Arizona State University to study acting. After receiving her BA at ASU, Wendy moved to San Francisco in 1995 where her only theatrical outlet was performing with an acting guild in the Renaissance Faire. Soon she grew disenchanted with theatre and the shallow insecurities of the actor within her.">

 We also strongly believe in the recruitment of minority students in order to increase the cultural diversity of the GSB. In addition to being members of the GSB community, we are a part of the broader Black community on Stanford's campus. The BBSA should continue to build formal and informal links with both the Black graduate and undergraduate members of the university through social activities, mentorship and co-sponsored professional events. While we have been blessed with opportunities, many in our community have not. As such, it is our responsibility to give back to the community as a whole through service and the ongoing development of Black business professionals.</td>
