 SolarQuest 2002 Pictures from SolarQuest 2002 are up. Thanks to all who participated and volunteered to help make the event such a success. The Queen's Solar Vehicle Team sends out a warm thank you to the CIBC community branches in the Kingston, ON area for their assistance in the Team's acquisition of stanchions. The stanchions will be used extensively during Solar Discovery to create display areas for Mirage. Solar Discovery, the QSVT province wide summer educational tour, is fast approaching.</td>

 The body plugs for Monsoon have now been belatedly machined and the project is back on track racing to make it to American Solar Challenge. .This is the homepage of the Arizona Solar Racing Team, a student run organization at the University of Arizona. The goal of our project is to promote alternative energy and engineering excellence through the design and construction of solar powered vehicles. We raced our most recent car, Monsoon, in the American Solar Challenge, finishing first in our class.</td>
