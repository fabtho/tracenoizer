 The Seattle Barrett's Esophagus Program has shown that a systematic, multidisciplinary approach designed to detect cancers arising in Barrett's esophagus when they are small and curable can improve the five-year cure rate for patients who develop esophageal adenocarcinoma by a factor greater than twenty. . People who develop Barrett's esophagus may have symptoms of heartburn, indigestion, difficulty swallowing solid foods, or nocturnal regurgitation that awakens them from sleep. Patients with Barrett's esophagus have an increased risk of developing esophageal adenocarcinoma, the most rapidly increasing cancer in the United States. The Barrett's Research Team is committed to understanding the genetic mechanisms and environmental risk factors that ultimately result in cancer of the esophagus, and to identifying intermediate genetic markers that will allow for the early identification of patients at an increased risk of developing esophageal cancer so that the cancer can be prevented or detected when it is early and the patient can be cured.</td>
