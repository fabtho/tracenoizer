<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" The imaging scientists have been busy since then preparing for rendezvous with Saturn, and examining the results of the Jupiter encounter. At present, Cassini is roughly midway between the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn, rushing to meet its appointment with the ringed planet on July 1, 2004. We were fortunate to capture the birth and development of a dark spinning vortex in the north jovian auroral region resembling the development of stratospheric ozone holes on Earth. These disturbances appear to arise solely within the confines of the circumpolar high-altitude region of both planets. We will have this question in mind as we attempt to understand the origin of this new phenomenon observed for the first time by Cassini's Imaging Science experiment.">

 Lake Sakakawea is nationally recognized for its Chinook salmon and walleye fishing. The Red River is famous for its trophy-sized catfish. For hunters, North Dakota is the ultimate for duck and goose hunting, which comes as no surprise because we lead the nation in annual duck production. Ring-necked pheasant and sharp-tailed grouse give our upland game hunters plenty of opportunity from early fall through the winter. From just about anywhere in the state, hunters and anglers can find a multitude of hunting and fishing choices.</td>
