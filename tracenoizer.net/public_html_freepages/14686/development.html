 The second considers issues of individual and market behavior under risk and uncertainty. The third revolves around the interrelationship between poverty, food security and environmental stress in developing areas. Much of this work is within the context of a new interdisciplinary venture, the Cornell African Food Security and Natural Resource Management program, part of the Cornell International Institute for Food, Agriculture and Development (CIFAD). ..</td>

 The imaging scientists have been busy since then preparing for rendezvous with Saturn, and examining the results of the Jupiter encounter. At present, Cassini is roughly midway between the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn, rushing to meet its appointment with the ringed planet on July 1, 2004. We were fortunate to capture the birth and development of a dark spinning vortex in the north jovian auroral region resembling the development of stratospheric ozone holes on Earth. These disturbances appear to arise solely within the confines of the circumpolar high-altitude region of both planets. We will have this question in mind as we attempt to understand the origin of this new phenomenon observed for the first time by Cassini's Imaging Science experiment.</td>
