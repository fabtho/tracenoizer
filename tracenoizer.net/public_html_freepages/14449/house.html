 The world-famous Wedgwood factory lies within the parish. Why not visit our church and attend our services, and have a holiday in North Staffordshire at the same time. In Barlaston village, the former Wedgwood home, Upper House, is now a fine hotel with first-class accomodation. Bed and breakfast accomodation is available at Hurden Hall Farm.
