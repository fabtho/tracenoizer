<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" "Brian gave me a phone number where I could reach him and said I could change my mind at anytime. In the meantime, he would contact me immediately if one became available. "Two days later, Brian e-mailed that he had located a new laptop for Mallory. It would be shipped within a few days, along with a postage-paid container to return the damaged one. I was so surprised and impressed with Brian and his great customer-care skills that I e-mailed him, commending his great skills and asking that my e-mail be forwarded to his manager.">

 If you need to make changes to a recurring charge - for example, change the amount billed, frequency, or credit card information - you must get written permission from your customer first. In order to avoid reentering information a second time, do not exit the application or close QuickBooks until you've finished the application process. Within two business days, the financial institution will contact you via e-mail (in most cases). If additional review of your application is deemed necessary, you will be notified of a decision within 1 to 5 business days after all additional information has been received by the financial institution. Within two business days, you will receive an e-mail from VeriSign notifying you that your account has been activated.</td>

 You may then enter any new information that you need to, as well as choose a different username and password, if you like. ^Top Q) How often will I be charged for your services. - Your account will be charged every thirty days from the day of the month you originally subscribed. For example, if your account was activated on October 15th, your credit card will be automatically charged again on November 15th. If you cancel your account before that time, we will not renew your account in 30 days.</td>

 Anyway, Karen was also an outspoken feminist and we even started to garner a hardcore-feminist-punk following of sorts, some group of women called the Fester Girls, out here in california. Regardless, Karen definately deserves to be on your page as Karen was a groundbreaker of sorts. There werent a whole lot of women fronting hardcore bands in those days, Sin34 being about the only exception i can recall (legal weapon was considered kinda arty, and the avengers were not hardcore). Karen used to get a lot of shit and I remember some knarly guy slamming her pretty hard in Denver one night. The punks paid a lot of lip service to equality but when it came down to it a lot of them were macho assholes who could not handle having a woman on stage singing to them their atrocities.</td>
