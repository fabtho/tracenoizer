 . HANNA Education leaders must embrace new technology and an old-fashioned entrepreneurial spirit to thrive in the current education marketplace, says Donald E. Hanna, professor of educational communications at the University of Wisconsin-Extension and its former chancellor. The plans are part of a broad strategy, encouraged by King Abdullah II, to develop Jordan's educational infrastructure through the use of computers and information technology. Many of the most popular professors on some campuses are comfortable using classroom-based technology, but so far, few choose to teach via distance education.</td>

 It may not be out of place, therefore, to indicate in the most summary fashion what has been the nature of these fortuitous hindrances. In its earlier formulation, the argument necessarily drew largely on first-hand observation of the conduct of affairs at Chicago, under the administration of its first president. As is well known, the first president's share in the management of the university was intimate, masterful and pervasive, in a very high degree; so much so that no secure line of demarcation could be drawn between the administration's policy and the president's personal ruling. It is true, salient features of academic policy which many observers at that time were inclined to credit to the proclivities of Chicago's first president, have in the later course of things proved to belong to the impersonal essence of the case; having been approved by the members of the craft, and so having passed into general usage without abatement. Yet, at the time, the share of the Great Pioneer in reshaping American academic policy could scarcely have been handled in a detached way, as an impersonal phenomenon of the unfolding historical sequence.</td>
