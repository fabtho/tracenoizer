 The Basics of Buying a Personal Computer System Computer Buying Links . . The purpose of this booklet is to describe the parts of the computer and the benefits and pitfalls of these parts so that you can make an educated decision on your computer purchase. This book is designed to assist you in buying a home computer and will not cover portable computers or laptops. It will also mainly talk about the PC rather than Macintosh, as I feel that the PC is a better choice.</td>
