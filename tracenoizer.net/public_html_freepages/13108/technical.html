 Of special note are the advanced sampling techniques that can yield near-optimal predictive results for data mining. The potential business advantages of data mining are well documented in publications for executives and managers. However, developers implementing major data-mining systems need concrete information about the underlying technical principles--and their practical manifestations--in order to either integrate commercially available tools or write data-mining programs from scratch. This book is the first technical guide to provide a complete, generalized roadmap for developing data-mining applications, together with advice on performing these large-scale, open-ended analyses for real-world data warehouses. A DMSK demonstration applet showcased on Sun's JavaReel Site can now be seen locally.</td>
