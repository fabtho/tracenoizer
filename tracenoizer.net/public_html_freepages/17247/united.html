 In addition to its weekly (often twice a week) drills, Company B participated in over forty special patriotic events, sometimes with the entire battalion; but often alone, when the other companies could not respond. These special occasions were parades, the guarding of troop trains, etc. During the influenza epidemic, fall and winter of 1918-1919, Company B furnished the military escort, volley firing detail and bugler for full military honers at the funerals of numerous United States soldiers brought to Topeka for burial; and this was often at a time When the epidemic was so severe that indoor services were not held and only services at the grave permitted. During its entire service, Company B maintained a complete and ever-ready unit of Kansas militia; and it never failed to respond to any call of duty, although it often caused much personal and business sacrifice. While not permitted to go overseas it tried to keep "the home fires burning," and is proud of its record in having given the elementary military training to almost one hundred young men who went from its ranks into United States military service, some of whom served upon the historic battle fields of France.</td>
