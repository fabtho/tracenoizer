The Congress was opened by speeches from Mr Barrie Ireton (Director General of the UK's Department for International Development) Professor Michael Knight (the current IAH President) from Australia and Professor Stephen Foster (Assistant Director of the British Geological Survey, who was Co-Chair of the Congress Organising Committee).
