 Many students and visitors remark on the warmth and good humour of the local people, the Geordies, who make the modern City so lively. The remnants of this ancient Kingdom encompass the Northern Pennines ("England's last true wilderness area"), the majestic border hills, and a magnificent unspoilt coastline, scalloped with sandy bays and dotted with mediaeval castles. The World Heritage Site of Durham Cathedral, little altered since the eleventh century, occupies a proud peninsula above the River Wear. Older still is Hadrian's Wall, built as the outermost boundary of the Roman Empire in the Second Century AD. Northumbria has a proud cultural tradition, expressed in a rich dialect and celebrated by the mellow strains of the Northumbrian Bagpipes.</td>

 During the influenza epidemic, fall and winter of 1918-1919, Company B furnished the military escort, volley firing detail and bugler for full military honers at the funerals of numerous United States soldiers brought to Topeka for burial; and this was often at a time When the epidemic was so severe that indoor services were not held and only services at the grave permitted. During its entire service, Company B maintained a complete and ever-ready unit of Kansas militia; and it never failed to respond to any call of duty, although it often caused much personal and business sacrifice. While not permitted to go overseas it tried to keep "the home fires burning," and is proud of its record in having given the elementary military training to almost one hundred young men who went from its ranks into United States military service, some of whom served upon the historic battle fields of France. Company B will always look back with satisfaction upon its humble service during the great World War, not because of what it did, but as to what it was willing to do had opportunity offered. Company C acted as escort to drafted men and performed guard duty at the depot.</td>
