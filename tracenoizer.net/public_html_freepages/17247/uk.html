 However, the legacy of its industrial past is not grime, but a splendid array of Georgian honeystone buildings in the City centre, built with proceeds of nineteenth century coal extraction. The City boasts six bridges over a dramatic riverfront, and six theatres; the grandest of these, the Theatre Royal, is the third home to the Royal Shakespeare Company. Almost hidden behind the Georgian and Edwardian shopfronts is the modern indoor shopping centre of Eldon Square, one of the UK's most successful city centre malls.

 It was attended by some 340 participants from no fewer than 46 countries, and was the most international groundwater congress ever held in the United Kingdom. The participants, about half of which came from Western Europe, were offered an in-depth scientific programme, relating to the congress theme of 'Groundwater in the Urban Environment'. The Congress was opened by speeches from Mr Barrie Ireton (Director General of the UK's Department for International Development) Professor Michael Knight (the current IAH President) from Australia and Professor Stephen Foster (Assistant Director of the British Geological Survey, who was Co-Chair of the Congress Organising Committee). These poster sessions were a special feature of the Congress and prizes for the best poster in each session were awarded. The Congress proceedings are being published as books by Balkema, the IAH publisher, in association with the IAH British National Committee and the British Geological Survey, under the co-ordination of John Chilton the Congress Chief Editor.</td>
