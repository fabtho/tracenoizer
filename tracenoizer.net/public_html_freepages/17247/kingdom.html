 The bubbly night-life of the City with its carnival atmosphere is widely renowned. Many students and visitors remark on the warmth and good humour of the local people, the Geordies, who make the modern City so lively. The remnants of this ancient Kingdom encompass the Northern Pennines ("England's last true wilderness area"), the majestic border hills, and a magnificent unspoilt coastline, scalloped with sandy bays and dotted with mediaeval castles. The World Heritage Site of Durham Cathedral, little altered since the eleventh century, occupies a proud peninsula above the River Wear. Older still is Hadrian's Wall, built as the outermost boundary of the Roman Empire in the Second Century AD.</td>
