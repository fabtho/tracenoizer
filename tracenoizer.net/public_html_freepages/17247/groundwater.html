 It is being issued as a technical document in the WCP Applications and Services Series. . It was attended by some 340 participants from no fewer than 46 countries, and was the most international groundwater congress ever held in the United Kingdom. The participants, about half of which came from Western Europe, were offered an in-depth scientific programme, relating to the congress theme of 'Groundwater in the Urban Environment'. The Congress was opened by speeches from Mr Barrie Ireton (Director General of the UK's Department for International Development) Professor Michael Knight (the current IAH President) from Australia and Professor Stephen Foster (Assistant Director of the British Geological Survey, who was Co-Chair of the Congress Organising Committee).</td>
