 These poster sessions were a special feature of the Congress and prizes for the best poster in each session were awarded. The Congress proceedings are being published as books by Balkema, the IAH publisher, in association with the IAH British National Committee and the British Geological Survey, under the co-ordination of John Chilton the Congress Chief Editor. The Seminar at Hanoi, Vietnam was held from 27-29 November 1997 on the theme of Mitigation of Water-related Disasters in which 60 delegates, 26 of whom from outside Vietnam, participated. The objective of the Seminar was to bring on one platform all those working in the field of flood disaster mitigation and management, to promote regional cooperation and exchange of experiences amongst the flood disaster-prone countries of South and South-East Asia, as well as to promote efforts at scientific and efficient management of flood disasters. These seminars were ICID's contribution towards the global efforts being made in this direction during the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction (IDNDR) and IHP-V programs on themes 6, 7, and 8.</td>
