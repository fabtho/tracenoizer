 The City boasts six bridges over a dramatic riverfront, and six theatres; the grandest of these, the Theatre Royal, is the third home to the Royal Shakespeare Company. Almost hidden behind the Georgian and Edwardian shopfronts is the modern indoor shopping centre of Eldon Square, one of the UK's most successful city centre malls. Beneath old and new buildings run the trains of Tyneside's rapid transit system, the Metro. At night, Newcastle comes alive on a scale unmatched elsewhere in England. The bubbly night-life of the City with its carnival atmosphere is widely renowned.</td>

 These seminars were ICID's contribution towards the global efforts being made in this direction during the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction (IDNDR) and IHP-V programs on themes 6, 7, and 8. The participants at Hanoi seminar appreciated the need for real-time data transmission and modernisation of the existing flood forecasting systems. The use of satellite based remote sensing for the preparation of flood inundation maps and deployment of a satellite based information and telecommunication system for emergency relief was also stressed in the seminar. The experts from UATI and France mentioned about the prospects of joint European-Asian Technical Cooperation and financial support for improving flood warning and forecasting in South-East Asia. The International Seminar on Evolution of a Scientific System of Flood Forecasting and Warning in the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna River Basins was held on 5-6 December 1997 at Dhaka, Bangladesh.</td>
