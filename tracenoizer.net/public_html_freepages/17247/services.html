 The first 20 Data Collection Platforms (DCPs) have been purchased and are being sent to the participating countries. With funds recently made available by the World Bank, an additional 5 DCPs will soon be purchased. Two expert missions have been fielded to Morocco and Tunisia to assess the feasibility of connecting National Hydrological Services to WMO's Global Telecommunication System for real time data recovery. Following a request from Tunisia the equipment necessary for this connection is being purchased by the project. Negotiations are underway with the World Bank to mobilise resources to support the extension of the project activities.</td>
