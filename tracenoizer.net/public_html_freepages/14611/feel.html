 On night of September 10th, 2001, I played this song continuously for 8 hours. 1999, I had already written friends that a huge firebombing of Bush's cabinet would take place from a tall building in September. I can still feel if there is going to be an immediate plane crash by listening to the words of this song. Music with a driving beat can make you want to dance. .</td>

 When you love another person you don't ask them to sacrifice a part of themselves in the name of that love. The true measure of romantic love is commitment and trust not physical attraction. It is possible to feel romantic love for more than one person at a given time. Just think, if it is possible for you to love both of your parents at the same time why would it be impossible to feel romantic love for two people at once. Don't beat yourself up emotionally if you find yourself in this unhappy situation.</td>
