 . I particularly like your Denton tour photos, which is where I grew up in the 70's. One think I am pleased about is the sense of optimism and renovations that seems to be present in Greater Manchester, something that I found hard to find as a teenager in the late 1980's. The recent "Queer as Folk" programme has done much to put Manchester on the map over here, even though it is to be shown on TV shortly, lots of people have seen it on video. It has done much to reverse the stereotypical image New Zealanders and Australians can have about Manchester, which is the dull "Cornonation Street" ey-oop, whippets and mushy peas stereotype.</td>

 Send them to your friends to make the day go a little bit faster. I can see your point, but I still think you're full of it. I don't know what your problem is, but I'll bet it's hard to pronounce. I see you've set aside this special time to humiliate yourself in public. I'm really easy to get along with once you people learn to see it my way.</td>
