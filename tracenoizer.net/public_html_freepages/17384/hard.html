 One of the many rewards for those who do voluntary work is the fact that they can be awarded a certificate for their efforts by Sefton Council. Two of our members, Phil McComish and Adrian Bradley, both in the Upper Sixth, were awarded such certificates as they have both completed over one hundred hours of voluntary work in our region. Students as enthusiastic and hard-working as Adrian and Phil could be regarded as a good example of what an ideal V. U member should be, because they are always willing to help. The rest of our members are working hard too, as practically every new member is already involved in voluntary work such as helping teachers in junior schools or working in charity shops, which is the most popular option so far.</td>
