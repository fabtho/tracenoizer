 Look for some new and exciting things at Hotel Mexcatine under new ownership. Thank you Muscatine Journal for keeping up on what happens through faith. All is well here in Cedar Rapids, come and watch my band play, we rock steady, steady rocking all night long. Thanks to Coe and Vance for holding the place down. I love keeping up with my old neighbors Lisa and Zach.</td>
