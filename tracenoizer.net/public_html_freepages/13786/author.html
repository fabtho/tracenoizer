 Say the word penis often enough and not only will you no longer choke on it, but you may even be able to write a report about the male member that gets straight to the point. There are also stomach-churning reports on what men in various cultures (including our own) do or allow to be done to their genitals, ranging from circumcision and castration to piercings, inserts, and tattoos. The author is often shadowed by a male friend, Enrique, who serves as a valuable truth versus baloney meter in evaluating the information she collects. Creative black-and-white illustrations serve as chapter headings. Spirited, filled with fact and some fancy, emphasizing the penis's power to drive male behavior but designed to make both women and men more comfortable with the dreaded wordand perhaps even the actualitypenis.</td>
