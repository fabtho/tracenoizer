 . The Word as Image (Getty artsednet) The Word as Image This unit investigates relationships between words and visual images including the use of words in paintings and graphic arts. It leads students through an examination of the development of alphabets from graphic gestures, investigation of letters and words in their everyday lives, and takes them full circle to the use of written symbols as gestures in modern painting. Among other goals, it leads students to an understanding of contemporary abstract and nonobjective art. The high school general art course is one that might be taken by students who are interested in art, but who are not attracted to studio art courses.</td>
