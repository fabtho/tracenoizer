Help evaluate a new question answering search engine. Experiments on Using Semantic Distances Between Words in Image Caption Retrieval - Smeaton, Quigley (ResearchIndex) A. Our long-term approach to IR applications is based upon precomputing semantically-based word-word similarities, work which is described elsewhere, and using these as part of the document-query similarity measure. A basic premise of our word-to-word similarity measure is that the input to this computation is the correct or intended word sense but in information retrieval applications, automatic and accurate word sense. The methods which intuitively seem most plausible are based on information content.</td>

 . Simple and Advanced Search Tips Search Tips Intellectual Property Website Simple Search Tips The simple text search allows you to search for information using specific words, modifiers, and operators. When you enter a word as a query, a simple text parser will add some modifiers to the word and pass everything to the search engine. You can also use traditional search operators such as AND, OR, and NOT. Results are measured by document scores; the higher the score, the more likely the document will match your search criteria.</td>

 As electives, courses such as these can serve a potentially large population of students who typically have not elected art in high school. . The Word as Image (Getty artsednet) The Word as Image This unit investigates relationships between words and visual images including the use of words in paintings and graphic arts. It leads students through an examination of the development of alphabets from graphic gestures, investigation of letters and words in their everyday lives, and takes them full circle to the use of written symbols as gestures in modern painting. Among other goals, it leads students to an understanding of contemporary abstract and nonobjective art.</td>
