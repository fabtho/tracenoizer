 Creating and Performing Strand Arts Curriculum Framework THE PRACTICE OF CREATING Republished in this protected area for the purpose of curriculum development. Creating and performing form the core of arts education. In the classroom they are intertwined as activities that are lively and learner-centered. Creating and performing often entail learning by interacting with others in a group. Teachers and students are partners in inquiry as they observe, respond physically, demonstrate techniques, and talk with one another.</td>

 Differing assumptions about the proper relationship between civic and private life influence ideas about the purposes of government. Differing ideas about the purposes of government have profound consequences for the well-being of individuals and society. For example, if one believes that the activities of government should be restricted to providing for the security of the lives and property of citizens, one might believe in placing severe restrictions on the right of government to intrude into their private or personal lives. On the other hand, if one believes that the moral character of the individual should be a public or civic matter, one might support a broad range of laws and regulations concerning private behavior and belief. Differing ideas about the purposes of government have profound consequences for the well-being of individuals and society.</td>
