 Properly appropriated, research overhead income could supplement and substitute for shrinking clinical income. Clinical research programs are vital to improve the health of patients throughout Kansas. Research opportunities for faculty, students, and residents have been limited in Wichita because of limited resources and inadequate support systems. Exploration of research opportunities in Wichita by the other KU campuses is needed. Little collaborative research has occurred between KU-Lawrence, KU-School of Medicine-Kansas City, KU-School of Medicine-Wichita and WSU.</td>
