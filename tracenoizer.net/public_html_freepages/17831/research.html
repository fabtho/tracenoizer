 The varied interests and background of the participating faculty guarantees a stimulating research environment and offers a wide variety of scientific resources to students. . These institutes include the Heart Research Center, the Center for Research on Occupational and Environmental Toxicology (CROET), the Neurological Sciences Institute (NSI), the Oregon Regional Primate Research Center (ORPRC) and the Vollum Institute. Investigators are drawn to the IBMS Program because of their shared interests in research focus groups and their interest in cross-disciplinary research training.

 . This gives the students a chance to describe their work to the entire department, including faculty and other students. In addition to the senior research project, our undergraduates can get involved in research in several other ways. These projects are supported with funding through external grants to the individual faculty involved with the work. Last year, the department began sponsoring a program of freshman research fellowships.</td>
