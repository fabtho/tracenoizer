 In the second part, Tangram Challenges, students can use tangram pieces to form given polygons. 5 Learning about Number Relationships and Properties of Numbers Using Calculators and Hundred Boards A major learning goal for students in the primary grades is to develop an understanding of properties of, and relationships among, numbers. Building on students' intuitive understandings of patterns and number relationships, teachers can further the development of number concepts and logical reasoning as described in the Number and Operations and Reasoning and Proof Standards. In this two-part example virtual 100 boards and calculators furnish a visual way of highlighting and displaying various patterns and relationships among numbers. Using calculators and hundred boards together, teachers can encourage students to communicate their thinking with others, as discussed in the Communication Standard.</td>

 Content Summary and Rationale The constitutional values and principles held by Americans provide the foundation for their attitudes regarding the proper ends and means of political life. They have shaped American political institutions and practices. In addition to experience, several intellectual traditions have influenced the development of American constitutional democracy. Among the most important of these were the ideas of classical liberalism with its emphasis on individual rights and classical republicanism. Throughout most of our history, the ideas associated with liberalism have been dominant.</td>
