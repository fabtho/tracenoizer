 Catalano, associate director, began in 1979 to develop the Social Development Strategy, which provides the theoretical basis for risk- and protective-focused prevention that underlies much of the group's research. Over 250 articles, books, and monographs have been produced by this group. Access to the University's vast libraries is augmented by the group's own collection of more than 10,000 reprints, books, and journals. Projects are supported by extensive data collection and data management teams and a strong administrative unit. The Social Development Research Group is affiliated with the School of Social Work and the Social Work Prevention Research Center at the University of Washington in Seattle.</td>
