 His research connects urban planning and traditional studies in architecture with the monitoring Internet traffic. As he pointed out, if we ever hope to learn from the wealth of knowledge being shared over the Internet, we need to start developing systems that can analyze traffic and generate meaningful data about to the type of communication taking place. As many of the panelists explained, in order to design systems that can facilitate dynamic understanding of data, our focus as information architects needs to shift from backend coding to an appreciation of digital aesthetics. What does it mean to have interstanding between ideas, instead of understanding of a singular concept. How does the interpretation of data and quality of information change in a digital environment.</td>

 Blinn, who replaced Parron as the Collection Manager (1987), designed a database application to inventory holdings and manage accessions and loans (1992). Wiegmann (hired in 1994) initiated the Collection's Genome Bank. Rapid growth of the Collection during the 1980's and 90's made it necessary to expand into two adjoining rooms (4317 Gardner in 1995; 4317 Gardner in 1996) as planned in the original design for Gardner Hall. Featured institution--North Carolina State University at Raleigh. .</td>
