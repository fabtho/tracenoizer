 Best to bookmark this main page for the most recent locations. Many thanks for those teachers who have suggested sites to add to this page. See the Search Tools in the Research and Critical Thinking page, and Research-It. I have also found John December's site -- Welcome to the Top of the Web -- to be an excellent starting point for research. You can also click on the Britannica logo below to open a new browser window for a search.</td>

 These are just a few of the many questions that must be pondered when critically evaluating Web sites. Anything can and will be published on the Web, therefore critical evaluation skills are essential to determine the value of the information. The Web should never be the ONLY source of information used for research. There are many resources in print, CD-ROM and database formats that should be utilized for research as well. If you were shopping for a new car, it is unlikely you would only go to one dealership.</td>
