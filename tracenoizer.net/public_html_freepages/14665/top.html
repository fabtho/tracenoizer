<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" After a very sluggish start, SGC opened the scoring in the 6th minute when former Coffee High standout Mark Bell lofted a long pass from a deep defensive position to Adam Crow at midfield. Fifteen minutes later, in almost an identical sequence of events, Bell started the Tiger attack with a goal kick which found the head of Joe Leavy. Leavy flicked the ball forward to a hard-charging Shaun Camay, who broke away from his defender and beat the Gordon keeper from the top of the 18 with a shot to the left side of the goal. Gordon came out strong to start the second half, pressuring SGC keeper Ben Horner with many shots. Washington sent a well-timed pass to Camay, who easily beat the Gordon keeper to the left side of the goal.">
