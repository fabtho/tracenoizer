 The Special Features include my monthly cricket column, fan encounters and your one and only chance to vote in the Cricket Oscars. I deserve some praise for coming up with such ideas. Also included is interesting stuff about the team members and wallpapers and more. (please keep reading what's in the blue columns too. The entires in the guestbook are getting very lonely.</td>

 That usually happens when we normal people make outlandish demands. It never happens when Jessie Armstead, in what has become an annual ritual, goes to shake down the New York Giants for more money. The undisputed backbone of the Giants, Armstead knows the team has no spine. If Armstead is serious, he'll bring agent Drew Rosenhaus, created years ago from an Alaskan oil slick. Why is Armstead's fifth attempt at a new deal any more preposterous than his fourth.</td>
