The original choice for providing the voice of Voley was a fabulous Irish comedian, Dermot Morgan. The original voice cast's accents worked well in Europe, but Tim was selected to make the Irish accent more accessible to a US audience. Although the director, Graham Ralph, was sad to lose the original voice choices, he was very pleased with Tim's contribution.">
