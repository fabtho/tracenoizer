 I should be waking up any hour now, but I am suddenly awakend by a loud CRASH. Glass falling and items shuffling somewhere inside my room cause me to open my eyes and become conscious. Then a DUCK flaps down from my roomates bed onto the floor five feet in front of me and freezes. As I am staring at this duck, I hear MORE flapping comming from my roomate's bed. Friends are talking outside the room in the hallway in a worried voice.</td>
