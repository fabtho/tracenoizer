 It is a must have for any serious Barks fan and for all of you who want to become one. This comic book is about Uncle Scrooge's past and his one and only girl friend. Naturally this splendid story is also about gold and Scrooge's love to money. It features all American titles (with an image for each comic story), dates of production and release, complete story index in both English and German. Although this book was made for the German market it still has a lot of useful information for the Barks Comic collector.</td>

 The strategy that seems to work the best is to have them round up if the number before is 5 or more, or round off if it is 4 or less. Do you know of any other strategies that other teachers have found successful. Alden ------------- Dear Alden, I tell my fifth graders the duck story before I begin a lesson on rounding. Believe it or not, many of them don't "get it" yet either. I think the reason for that is that they have been given this set of steps to perform that don't make any sense to them.</td>
