 In the 1960's the strip embraced the social change of the time and had flower children and Russian leaders, it was probably the first comic strip to comment on ecological disaster and man's treatment of the environment. . By some accounts Walt was taught how to draw by his father who painted scenery for theatre productions and vaudeville shows, but other accounts have his father as a munitions worker. He went to work at the Bridgeport Post after graduating High School and in 1936 found himself working at Walt Disney Studios as an animator. During this time Walt worked on such famous Disney vehicles as Fantasia, Dumbo and Pinnochio.</td>
