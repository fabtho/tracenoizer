 This log will keep pointers to ongoing information about SCRUM. The discussion was irrelevant to those attempting to understand the distinction. The practices of traditional software development processes are inadequate to control projects with complex technology and sophisticated requirements. Agile processes are based on empirical process control, a technique widely adapted by competitive manufacturing and development environments over the last twenty years. When the process is too complicated for the defined approach, the empirical approach is the appropriate choice.</td>
