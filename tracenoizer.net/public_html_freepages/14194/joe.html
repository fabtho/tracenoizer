 All I know is that we have to have it to the publisher by January, and however long it takes them to get it on shelves is their business. Then the next book we're doing after that is just a best-of collection. We want to drive The New York Times and USA Today out of business, so that when Joe Citizen gets up in the morning and gets his morning paper thrown at him at his front door, it's The Onion. ..</td>
