 The df command can be used to track down the filesystem in other situations. By default, the showdumps command shows all dumps on all unexpired tapes if you're on the CIS Unix systems. Other systems just show the (unexpired) dumps performed on the local system. The showdumps command can produce a lot of output, so you might want to pipe the command output through more or less. If you're just interested in a single filesystem (as you usually are), you can also pipe the output though tail to get the information on the most recent dumps.</td>
