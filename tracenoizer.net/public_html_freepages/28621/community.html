 A member of ApsaA for over 40 years, Fischer was recognized for his past contributions to psychoanalysis, his vision of the future of the field, and its place in relating to people and society. One of his many goals as president is to educate the public about the value of psychoanalytic thinking as it applies to the overall health of an individual. A staunch proponent in the value of psychoanalysis, Fischer desires to expand the scientific community's knowledge of human beings through research focused on the function of the human mind. Fischer received his medical degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1961 and completed his residency training in psychiatry at the Institute of Pennsylvania Hospital in 1965. Fischer is board certified in both child and adolescent and adult psychoanalysis.</td>
