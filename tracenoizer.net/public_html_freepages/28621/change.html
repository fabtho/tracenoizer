 In September 1997, the Office of Academic Support Services for Student Athletes and most of the athletic coaches and their staff were moved into the same building. Now, it is much easier for coaches to talk with the staff and to get questions answered regarding such matters as eligibility, certification, and academic advisement. This change in location also provided clerical support staff for the Office of Academic Support Services for Student Athletes. There was no clerical support staff in the former building. In the new location a receptionist and clerical staff are available to meet with student-athletes to determine their current needs, make appointments with Academic Support Services staff or assist them as required.</td>
