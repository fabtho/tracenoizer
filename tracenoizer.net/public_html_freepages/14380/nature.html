 The sight of Bosch's nearly hallucinatory vision of life in all its elaborate fecundity sparked an epiphany so powerful Williams embarked on a life-altering study of the painting she chronicles. Williams gives herself over wholly to the experience, even writing from within the painting's lushly detailed and wildly inventive landscapes, an immersion that gives rise to extraordinarily revelatory leaps of thought. Williams' insights into Bosch's resonant work form an arresting inquiry into our relationship with nature, the divide between religion and spirituality, and the question of how to preserve wilderness. With each leap, she extends her definition of a "living faith" and discovers something new about our need for art and wilderness. Earth is art, Williams realizes, and at the very least, it deserves the same respect and protection accorded Bosch's triptych.</td>

 Glyphs, 5 Folio Six Winters draws his inspiration from innumerable sources. Science and technology intrigue him as much as poetry, philosophy, personal feelings, and the work of other artists. Although his imagery may originate in nature, Winters is not an impartial illustrator. He reinterprets and transforms his subjects through the use of color, stroke, size and placement of forms, and ambiguous but intriguing titles. Winters makes few prints in a simple or straightforward manner.</td>

us Terry Tempest Williams lights a candle before she sits down to write. Respect is paying off for Williams, a Mormon woman from Salt Lake City who once thought she had nothing to offer. For she is fast becoming one of the best-known nature writers in the country. It pains her to leave her Utah home, to take to the road, to go public. '' Tears came to her eyes as she made this confession to the startled graduate students.</td>
