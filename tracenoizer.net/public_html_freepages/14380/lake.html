 . When her book begins, Williams' mother has just been diagnosed with ovarian cancer, and the book follows the next five years of her life and death. At the same time, the Great Salt Lake is rising to record heights, flooding the Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge and scattering the birds and animals with whom Williams has lived her life. CommentaryWith it's beautiful and poetic, yet clear and readable language, this book stands out as one of the best of the illness narratives. The contrast of nature acting on the Great Salt Lake, as detailed by maps and water measurements throughout the book, against the natural--or unnatural--cycle and death of Williams' mother and grandmother is set to add to each story.</td>
