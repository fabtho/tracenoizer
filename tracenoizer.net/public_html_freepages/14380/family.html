 Terry Tempest Williams TERRY TEMPEST WILLIAMS Terry Tempest Williams was born in 1955 and grew up within sight of the Great Salt Lake. Her writing reflects her intimate relationship with the natural world. Those tenets of family and community that I see at the heart of that culture are then articulated through story. " Terry Tempest Williams was identified by Newsweek as someone likely to make "a considerable impact on the political, economic and environmental issues facing the western states in this decade.
