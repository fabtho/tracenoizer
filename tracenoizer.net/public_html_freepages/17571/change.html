 If an agent observes a sign, there is a chance the agent may interpret a meaning different from that of the agent who created the sign. And there is a chance that the observer may see an object that is accidentally created, and looks like a sign, and interpret it as having some meaning. This doesn't change the fact that the sign itself has a meaning for the agent. So, if I find a four leaf clover, and consider it a sign of good luck, the fact that it is accidental does not change the fact that I consider it a sign of good luck.

 As I mentioned in my reply to Pat Cassidy, I don't think we should introduce terms like 'MentalObject', 'Concept' or 'ConceptualStructure' unless we can specify exactly what they mean. Every school of philosophy and psychology has their own take on how these notions should be cashed out, and it would be a shame to introduce confusion or to alienate potential users of the ontology. For example, an article whose topic is a recent change in the price of oil may refer to many other things, e. ") Note that 'represents' is now a subrelation of 'refers-to', since presumably something can represent something else only if it refers to this other thing. Note too that these definitions rely on the notion of 'Representation' defined below.</td>

 Students should expect to keep an on-going literary journal in lieu of essays, plus tests and quizzes. This course examines what causes additions and what can be done to help individuals and families deal with addictions. Students will be involved in hands-on learning opportunities for change at individual and community level. Information will be provided on chemical dependencies and other addictions such as gambling, sex, and obsessive behaviors. .</td>
