 Darling had a passion for being exactly like his neighbours; so, of course, they had a nurse. How thorough she was at bath-time, and up at any moment of the night if one of her charges made the slightest cry. She had a genius for knowing when a cough is a thing to have no patience with and when it needs stocking around your throat. She believed to her last day in old-fashioned remedies like rhubarb leaf, and made sounds of contempt over all this new-fangled talk about germs, and so on. It was a lesson in propriety to see her escorting the children to school, walking sedately by their side when they were well behaved, and butting them back into line if they strayed.</td>

 Every school of philosophy and psychology has their own take on how these notions should be cashed out, and it would be a shame to introduce confusion or to alienate potential users of the ontology. For example, an article whose topic is a recent change in the price of oil may refer to many other things, e. ") Note that 'represents' is now a subrelation of 'refers-to', since presumably something can represent something else only if it refers to this other thing. Note too that these definitions rely on the notion of 'Representation' defined below. I think we need a notion of a formula that is expressed in accordance with the selectional restrictions etc.</td>

 Also, I think you missed the exact point of my post. I also think that there was no reference that could have all been demaning in any of my posts for many years on this list that could ever been construed as demeaning to anyone, any work, any process. Aesthetics are one thing and I am sure that in all the posts on this list by those who care to contribute, I can't think of any one, including myself, that has at all berated anyones work. Yes we have our own tastes and aesthetic visions of the world and our pots, but to imply that my post demean others or at at all in anyway criticize others work has missed the point and is not true. While I speak my truth, as I hope we all do, my truths in ceramics are particularly pointed at those who would embrace any one way of working and promote it as the way pottery should be and then judge others with those views.</td>
