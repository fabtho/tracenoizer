 Kuffler (1913-1980) was the most dominant figure in experimental neuroscience in the 1960s and '70s. He opened up and provided rigorous ground work in so many diverse areas that there is hardly anyone in neuroscience today who does not rely on his contributions. What he wanted to achieve was to reveal the inherent beauty of the detailed mechanisms whereby nerve cells go about their daily business. " Lessons he taught by example about how to do research and how to interact with one's students and colleagues transcend specific disciplines and are timeless. Kuffler's research was done at Harvard Medical School, where he created the first neurobiology department, and at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts.</td>
