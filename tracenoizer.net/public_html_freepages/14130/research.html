 This has already been shown for a few programming language . . Technical Monograph PRG-107, Programming Research Group, Oxford University Computing Laboratory, November 1992. 3, are partially alleviated and may simplify the form of the model conjecture. Making such a general restriction on specifications is, of course, impracticable in that it compromises modularity.</td>
