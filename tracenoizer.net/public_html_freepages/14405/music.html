 . WBEZ Chicago Public Radio- Eight Forty-Eight with Steve Edwards a. Eight Forty-Eight features Chicago Public Radio's news reporters and music hosts as well as contributors who specialize in various topics. These topics range from politics to the arts, science to sports, and everything in between.

 . Although Mike has been in radio for some 25 years, he "didn't realize the effect weather has on our everyday lives. He had been a "voice" in and around Georgia before getting into weather, working various formats from country at WKHX 101 to Top 40 at 1230 WFOM, with a turn at Atlanta Classical Music WGKA 1190 as well. Now, having a greater appreciation for weather, he enjoys the excitement of severe weather. He classifies winter snowstorms as being the most difficult to manage, ".</td>

 Following a tragic accident in which the stations owner drowned, the station became KING Radio. It took former advertising agent Ted Allbeury to get the operation going professionally. He changed the name to Radio 390 and the music format to sweet music, aiming the station at the housewife audience. Roy Bates talks about Radio Essex, based on the Knock John naval fort. The station was later renamed BBMS (Britains Better Music Station).</td>
