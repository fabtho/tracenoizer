 Thanks to Jim Parkes for historical text and to Francois Lhote for images. . This is the story of the offshore stations based on former wartime defence forts in the British Thames estuary. Hear Screaming Lord Sutch tell how he discovered an abandoned wartime defence fort and started Radio Sutch. Calvert was later shot dead in a dispute over ownership of a transmitter.</td>
