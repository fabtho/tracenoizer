 Charles Johnson's "Dreamer," a historical novel set in the last two years of Martin Luther King Jr. 's life that taps as one of its themes the duality of good and evil, is restrained, poetic and earnest. In short, it's a very nicely written book -- which is part of its problem. He's a shadowy character who comments on the action from behind a dense curtain but who doesn't show us much of himself. Johnson -- whose novel "Middle Passage" won the 1990 National Book Award -- is a gifted prose stylist.</td>
