 Anyway, now I know where and when Green was born and who in the family he was passed down to and when. I think that they are on the will of James VAUGHN along with green, but it does not say wich ones they are. on the farm of JAMES VAUGHN, but when James died in 1843 Green was willed to Elizabeth VAUGHN RAMSEY. BUT, On John VAUGHN'S will (James's Son and Elizabeth's half brother)1862-63 Green VAUGHN is found again. Elizabeth is still alive at this time, so I don't know how John got Green.</td>

 He is buried in Orange Hill and I think his wife is too, Elizabeth (Lizzie) Martin. John and Katie lived in Tracy City and later moved to Henretta,OK. He died and is buried there and Katie moved to the North somewhere to live with one of their children. While in Tracy City a year ago doing research I went to the Orange Hill Cemetery. and Elander Dykes, and I knew they had a daughter Jennie, just about the same age.</td>
