 The Insect Pathology Laboratory originated with the transfer of Dr. Dutky and the Insect Pathology Unit from Moorestown, NJ to Beltsville, MD in 1954. The laboratory received the pioneering research laboratory status and began a dynamic expansion in both personnel and scope when the late Dr. Heimpel was hired in 1961 as the Principal Insect Pathologist and later became Laboratory Chief. Heimpel hired and directed ten new scientists in work on basic research problems associated with insect viruses, insect cell culture, Bacillus thuringiensis and other areas of insect pathology.</td>
