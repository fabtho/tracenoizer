 Statement from Assemblyman Jim Morrissey Statement from Assemblyman Jim Morrissey ASSEMBLYMAN, SIXTY-NINTH DISTRICT ORANGE COUNTY The following statement is released by Friends of Jim Morrissey P. That is why I have worked so hard as an Assemblyman on behalf of the Vietnamese people -- both here in California and in Vietnam. A few months later, I went to Vietnam - at my own expense - to try to win the freedom for Jimmy Tran and nine other Vietnamese American political prisoners. This past spring I sponsored the Southeast Asian Genocide Remembrance Week to call attention to the suffering of the people of Vietnam and other nations under the communists. On April 30, I wrote President Clinton, again asking him to help win freedom for Jimmy Tran and nine other Vietnamese American political prisoners.</td>
