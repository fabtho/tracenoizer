 . Dilbert LE FastCounter Dilbert, by Scott Adams, is one of my favorite comic strips. Part of my morning ritual every day is to visit the Dilbert site and look at today's strip. The strip is about Dilbert, an engineer, and his sarcastic dog Dogbert, who believes he can rule the world because people are too stupid to stop him. If you've ever worked in a large company (or even a small one), you'll see a lot of truths in this strip.</td>
