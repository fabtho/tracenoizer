 The results show that it has excellent corrosion and scale inhibition efficiency,based on the top overhaul. .Electric Power College, Inner Mongolia Polytechnic University, Huhhot 010080,China;2. Their inhibition performance of scale and corrosion and dispersion performance have been studied and compared with HA and P(AM-SAS). Experimental results indicates that their scale and corrosion inhibition rates and dispersing Fe2O3 capability increase with the increasing of their concentration.</td>
