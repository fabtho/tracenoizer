 The PRC Government and President Jiang Zemin openly committed before President Clinton and the International community that the People's Republic would become the signatory to the UN International Convention on Civil and Political Rights, in fact, the People's Republic today still cannot tolerate the existence of any opposition parties in China. We believe that the Chinese Communist dictators are unable to eradicate the existence of the CDP and its spirit. Wang was taken from his home in eastern Zhejiang province mid-afternoon Monday, his wife Hu Jiangxia said. "Plain-clothes police came to our house around one o'clock and talked to my husband about his activities and about the Chinese Democracy Party. They took him away just before four o'clock," she said.</td>
