 If they agree with the approach taken, there is usually no problem as long as the course content is not so notorious as to arouse opposition from administrators or the general public. But if colleagues do not like the initiative, they have several potential excuses for opposing it. They can attack the course because (1) it diverges from the formal syllabus, (2) it is not sufficiently 'rigorous' or relevant to the discipline, (3) some students did not like it, or (4) there were some minor violations of formal procedures. These justifications for attack are used selectively.

 I have chosen four general topics in which I will suggest a role for bilingual education research. This paper is guided by two assumptions about the nature of bilingual education, at least as it has developed in the United States. The curriculum targets identified weaknesses or problems in the preparation of the students, emphasizing the need to improve English proficiency in them. It can be an organizing principle for the academic program of a whole school. If, indeed, it has this potential, why is it not mentioned in the literature on school restructuring or curriculum reform.</td>
