 The council is composed of industrial and academic leaders from around the world. (The acronym stands for Achievement Rewards for College Scientists. ) Sean's research efforts are focused on the role of geometric phases in sensing and control and mobile robotics. The ISR-affiliated Human Computer Interaction Laboratory is holding its 19th annual Symposium and Open House on Friday, May 31. The Institute for Systems Research develops, applies and teaches advanced methodologies of design and analysis to solve complex, hierarchical, heterogeneous and dynamic problems of engineering technology and systems for industry and government.</td>

 . To maintain a competitive advantage, they rely on the scheduling process as a key factor in winning market share. The heart of these systems is a set of advanced operations research models that enable analysts to take a global approach to decision making. The two systems combined provide 110 million francs in incremental revenue per year and substantially reduce operating costs.
