 The rest of the cover art was based on paintings by Robin and digitally altered by Charles and myself with the help of Tracey Roberts at Vestige. So this project is a melding of ideas and inputs on all levels. I'd done a live collaboration with him in Vienna in 1991 (back in his Zoviet France days) that you can hear on the Nocturnal Emissions "Energy Exchange" LP, and we'd worked on organising one or two projects in Newcastle when I lived up there. I liked the organic and painterly textures of his solo music, I also thought he would be very straightforward to work with, as he tends to get on with his music. I think for him like me, the music is more of a spiritual than an ego thing.</td>
