 . To maintain a competitive advantage, they rely on the scheduling process as a key factor in winning market share. The heart of these systems is a set of advanced operations research models that enable analysts to take a global approach to decision making. The two systems combined provide 110 million francs in incremental revenue per year and substantially reduce operating costs.
