 Taguchi vs Classical Design of Experiments (DOE) - Experimental Designs are used to identify or screen important factors affecting a process, and to develop empirical models of processes. Design of Experiment techniques enable teams to learn about process behaviour by running a series of experiments, where a maximum amount of information will be learned, in a minimum number of runs. Taguchi's Loss Function - Taguchi's Loss Function is a method of measuring quality central to Taguchi's approach to design. It establishes a financial measure of the user dissatisfaction with a product's performance as it deviates from a target value. Thus, both average performance and variation are critical measures of quality.</td>
