 Caroline has been with the University of British Columbia for 25 years; she started in the Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, where she was involved in research, administration and laboratory teaching to Medical and Pharmacology students; she still has an honorary faculty appointment in the department and lectures in the PCTH 300 course. Bruce became Director of Administration at the Biomedical Research Centre, where she was involved in the administration of a research facility operated by a UBC for-profit corporation, BR Centre Ltd. It was a natural step for Caroline to join the University's Industry Liaison Office with her combined experience in research, technology transfer, business and knowledge of the UBC community. Effective September 1, 1999, Caroline was appointed Associate Director. Caroline is actively involved in developing research collaborations as she feels this is an important part of strengthening ties between academia and industry.</td>

 Huge, heavy, large footprint, traditional CRT monitors are slowly but surely being phased out. In my opinion, given the ability to come up with several hundred extra bucks, if required, the discerning computer user will choose LCD over CRT. My experience is that once one becomes accustomed to working with soft, steady LCD images they do not wish to return to traditional CRT monitors. Select a LCD FPD at the time of purchase of a new Win XP (Millenium Edition) system. WYSIWYG HTML Editors I have never created a web page, need to get a web site up and running pronto, know nothing about HTML and don't have time to learn.</td>
