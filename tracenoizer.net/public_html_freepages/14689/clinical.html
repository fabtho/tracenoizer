 The data manager maintained contact with some of the patients who had participated in these trials at two Chicago-area hospitals. His contacts were made as part of the follow-up phase of the studies. NCI and the cooperative groups it sponsors to conduct clinical trials have a number of safeguards against scientific misconduct, including on-site auditing and quality-control systems. "We have a system in place to monitor these trials to assure the quality of the data that is collected, and if we find a problem, we have existing mechanisms to address it," he said. , chairman of the NSABP, said that he hopes this finding does not erroneously cause women treated for breast cancer to question its effectiveness.</td>

 Stack, MD Senior Associate Research Scientist Kathleen D. James Shayman serves as the associate chair for Research Programs in the Department of Internal Medicine. Shayman has made excellent progress towards initiating clinical studies of agents developed to halt the progression of sphingolipid storage diseases. Margolis has defined important protein-protein interactions that drive the cellular processes controlling kidney structure and function. Figure 1 shows how the molecular interactions defined by Dr.</td>

 .gr 2 Department of Computer Science, University of Crete, P. gr Abstract The basics of a particular Integrated Electronic Health Record (I-EHR) implementation are presented, as realised by the Patient Clinical Data Directory (PCDD) system. PCDD operates within the context of HYGEIAnet, the Integrated Healthcare Telematics Network of Crete. PCDD is based on a federation of autonomous information systems and provides to its authorized users alternative views of the health record as well as access and retrieval services to its geographically distributed segments.</td>
