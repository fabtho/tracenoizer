 Product Benefits ScriptLogic is software you can use to manage your network's Windows workstations and applications more efficiently, thereby significantly reducing network administration costs. Best of all -- you don't have to write or debug a single line of scripting code. By centralizing the process of desktop management and enabling remote troubleshooting and repair in many cases, ScriptLogic keeps users working with less intervention required by administrators. ScriptLogic leverages our unique "Template Technology" and "Validation Logic" during the network logon process to reduce the number of menial management tasks and to eliminate redundant administration so your staff can concentrate on more strategic activities and reduce your total cost of ownership. The benefits of a centralized approach to connecting network resources and configuring the operating system and applications to use them, are instantly realized -- whether your network consists of traditional clients, thin clients, or a mixture of both.</td>
