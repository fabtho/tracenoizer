 John Nance Garner at Sabinal, Texas, on November 25, 1895. They established and maintained their home in Uvalde, and they spent many years in Washington, D. Garner served as a Congressman from Texas and then as Vice President of the United States under President Franklin Delano Roosevelt from 1933 to 1941. Garner reached the point where she could not let go of her work without doing her husband's cause injury, so she kept on as her husband's secretary. It is the most remarkable partnership that Washington has ever known.</td>
