<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" During the second period, Tom Litchfield fired one in assisted by Charlie Brewer and Jim Brown. Moments later, Brewer scored assisted by Litchfield and Valeri Frolov, to give Gang Green a commanding 5-1 lead after two periods of play. In the third period Hooters scored two quick goals to cut the lead to 5-3 before Burg netted his second goal of the game, and fifth over the last four games, assited by Osiadlo. During the final few minutes Litchfield scored his second goal of the game assisted by Ron Dressler and Frolov to make it a 7-3 game. Hooters scored a meaningless goal during the waning seconds, but it wasn't enough as Gang Green won it's final regular season game 7-4.">
