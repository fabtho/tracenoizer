The league demands a lot from you so you have to try and be on top form every time you play. Definitely Manchester United and Liverpool, just the way they pass the ball around and make other teams run after it. Well the manager told me I was in the squad the day before and I phoned everybody to tell them and that night I couldn't sleep. I always get nervous before every game and personally I think it's a good thing as it gets the adrenaline going.">

 Piper Hector "Dart Tag" Thomson In an effort to get away from the drum corps, Hector has recently moved to Southampton and sold his car. In "Another Dartford and District bonding moment", the drummers have taken Hector to court, where he has been issued with an annual train ticket, and ordered to attend practices once a week as community service. There is a nasty rumour that Hector has run out of jokes, and is currently living under Jimmy Tarbuck's floorboards in the hope of learning some new material. Andy pulled off an impressive move to advance from the 3rd rank to lead the band - simply by turning round when the front rank counter-marched. After the ensuing mellee, Andy found himself leading the parade.</td>
