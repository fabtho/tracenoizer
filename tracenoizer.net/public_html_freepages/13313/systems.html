 Such a system would have much more sophisticated notions of identity and protection than those afforded by current operating systems, and it would provide a general-purpose protection system to augment current computer security systems. . Their role in the body is analogous to that of computer security systems in computing. Although there are many differences between living organisms and computer systems, we believe that the similarities are compelling and could point the way to improved computer security. Four examples of how we are applying ideas from immunology to today's computer security problems are a host based intrusion-detection method, a network based intrusion-detection system, a distributable change-detection algorithm, and a method for intentionally introducing diversity to reduce vulnerability.</td>

L-systems Software L-systems Software This page contains a list of software available for performing simulations using L-systems. 7 This software was developed by Przemyslaw Prusinkiewicz and his students at the Universities of Regina and Calgary. It is an enhanced version of the L-system language described in the book The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants.</td>
