The group was charged with establishing the basic requirements for a software infrastructure to support parallel applications development. Those requirements must be representative of the high-performance computing (HPC) user community as a whole. It must also be possible to implement the requirements in a robust and consistent fashion across a full range of parallel and clustered computing platforms.
