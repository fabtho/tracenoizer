Some of the levels progress into lots of little levels which may become a bit tedious to those who feel the way of the set levels (because of the save positions), although at the end of these levels you will always end up in the opening level foyer. One very important thing, for developers, is to transfer the cartoon character to a cartridge and still keep the cartoony atmosphere. Paradigm Entertainment have put a great deal of effort onto this, and they have succeeded very well. The voice characterizations where made almost perfect, by recalling the original database of voices from the cartoon, to the cart.">

 I haven't watched the tunes in awhile, better find out when it's on. I was also very big on the Looney Tunes show on Nickelodeon, and it's here I have one of my favorite memories. ) My sisters and I started a bit of shtick every time we watched one - we pretended to be directors attempting to "direct" the cartoon. and the Coyote's latest Road Runner-catching endevor. Robinson were, therefore I didn't understand the characterizations.</td>

 The Top Ranking Toon Foxes These sly fellows stick out in my mind as excellent representations of toon foxdom. These foxes are sly, crafty, and just plain neat to watch, making me proud to be a toon fox. Sadly, none of these foxes ever starred in more than one cartoon. So let them be remembered here by fellow toon foxes everywhere as masters of their cartoon domain. Easy Peckins FoxReginald Fox Easy Peckins, Warner Bros.</td>

 ) At first listen, it's easy to hear what we're told to hear, "god damn stupid nigger. " Donald is rarely easy to understand, and people have supposedly heard him say all sorts of risque things. In 1995, a 1937 Mickey Mouse cartoon called "Clock Cleaners" contained in Walt Disney Cartoon Classics series' video "Fun on the Job" made the news because it allegedly included a frustrated Donald Duck shouting "Fuck you. ", leading Wal-Mart to pull the video from its shelves. Funny how nobody ever noticed this until the cartoon was nearly sixty years old, though.</td>
