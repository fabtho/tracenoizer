 We base our DMA reviews on research that we gather at least four times a year from our diary samples in all markets. They are asked to keep track of television viewing for one week, recording in a diary that we provide all viewing by all household members. If you want access to another market's television stations, you can ask your satellite provider to request a waiver from the local television stations directly. Local television stations are no longer required to grant waivers to individual subscribers, as they had in the past, so now the satellite providers need to request this from the stations for you. Please remember that none of our research tells a local station what news they should cover, or where their news bureaus should be.</td>
