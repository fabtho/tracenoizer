 My main interest is currently the TIGER project, and consequently its obvious large-scale successor HNX. I try to be useful for the IMPACT system on the STEREO mission, upcoming missions like ACCESS, and I still consider myself part of the ISOMAX project. I'm not afraid of theory, I like teaching and I munch computer code for breakfast. And in the end, we learn about the universe, the biggest thing there is, by looking at the smallest things that can be looked at. Measuring single particles and single photons; single phonons, even.</td>
