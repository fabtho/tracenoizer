 Actually Church of Sweden have been in communion with anglicans since 1922. . I work as a bus driver and study theology at the university in Lund. I'm a member in Church of Sweden (most people are over here, but I'm also visiting my church at sundays). It's a lutheran church, but the reformation in Sweden did not abolish the catholic ministry so we still have bishops, priests and now days deacons too.</td>
