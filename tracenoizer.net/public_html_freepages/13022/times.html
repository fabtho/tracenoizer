 When it was released, I played Half-Life and thought it was a blast. I hope to have enough time to check out System Shock 2, soon; the original rocked but at the moment, Dark Age of Camelot has me completely hooked. My favourite single-player game of all times must be Elite. I'm still waiting for a massive multiplayer online version to appear. Meanwhile, Christian Pinder has used the original BBC sources for an excellent new version.</td>

 His recitative vocals also appeared to amuse some of the audience but, unfortunately, were unintelligible to this Englishman. And there was also the sandpaper and plastic blocks or brushes dragged across the horizontal drum surfaces, making the bowing of cymbals almost ordinary by comparison. I suspect that not all the performance was freely improvised and that some elements may have been suggested beforehand, particularly by Carl (as suggested in the sleeve notes to Blue Goo Park) but at all times it was the interplay of the three musicians that was most important, whether playing as a trio or in the various duet combinations of both instruments and musicians. 1969, Westberliner stadtmusik 1969 I-IV, Leiterwagen Records LWR 16. 1982, Bergisch-Brandenburgisches Quartett, Amiga 856031.</td>

 The touch of worldmusic that one hears in a lot of what Sven Vaeth and Ralf Hildenbeutel have written stems from certain influences as e. grom musicians such as Joe Mubare or Peter Gabriel. Many times the tracks remind of soundtracks or they could very well be used as such. they are not really tracks but songs that tell stories. It's part of Sven Vaeth's nature that these songs tend to be a bit bombastic at times it's as if Trevor Horn had been there looking over Svens's and Ralf's shoulders.</td>
