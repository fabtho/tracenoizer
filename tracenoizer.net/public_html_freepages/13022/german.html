 A complete bibliography by Willy Hess is listed in section IV below. No effort has been made to exhaust the list of non-English editions. However, I devote considerable space to the Swedish and German ones, the former generally being the originals (most published by the firm of Albert Bonnier in Stockholm). His works in German were published almost exclusively by F. Brockhaus in Leipzig; the demand for his work in German seems to have been insatiable.</td>

 Kooperation mit sozialen Agenten (Sven Wohlgemuth, September 1998, digital signature) You can find the other drafts of this seminar on this site. For the encryption-process, you need my public key. Both keys have been certified by the German PC-magazine c't. Note that this is not a very secure way of obtaining a key. If you want to be really sure, try to obtain it in more ways than this and contact me to check my fingerprint.</td>
