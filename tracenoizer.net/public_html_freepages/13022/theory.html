 . I believe that finding good solutions to this problem requires approaches that cut across many different fields. My research draws on areas such as artificial intelligence, robotics, decision theory, and operations research. So far, I have applied it to mobile scouting and delivery robots, but I am always looking for new applications. .</td>

 The 1998 Nobel Prize in Chemistry to Walter Kohn for his pioneering work on the density-functional theory. . An important part of my research is developing efficient methods and computer software for first-principles calculations on large atomic systems (1000 atoms or more), based on Density-Functional Theory (DFT), with applications mostly on defects in semiconductors but also on nanostructures and biochemical molecules. (List of publications) On part time I am advanced consultant in scientific computing at the High Performance Computing Centre North (HPC2N) From 1997 to 1999 I was lecturer at the National Graduate School of Scientific Computing (NGSSC). I am responsible for the activity in scientific computing at the Centre of Applied Mathematics (CTM) at LTU.</td>

 My main interest is currently the TIGER project, and consequently its obvious large-scale successor HNX. I try to be useful for the IMPACT system on the STEREO mission, upcoming missions like ACCESS, and I still consider myself part of the ISOMAX project. I'm not afraid of theory, I like teaching and I munch computer code for breakfast. And in the end, we learn about the universe, the biggest thing there is, by looking at the smallest things that can be looked at. Measuring single particles and single photons; single phonons, even.</td>
