 At SCT, we believe successful leaders blaze new paths instead of following old ones. They create new rules instead of abiding by existing ones. We have a wide variety of technical, sales, marketing, and management positions available throughout the United States and beyond. Our headquarters are located in Malvern, PA, a western suburb of Philadelphia. .</td>
