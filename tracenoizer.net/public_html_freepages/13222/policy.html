 Over time, the site will continue to grow and evolve, ultimately housing the world's most comprehensive digital collection of archival materials on U. domestic issues, foreign relations and political events from the past decade. Added to this will be the work of the post-presidential Clinton Foundation, an international think tank and action center for foreign policy, conflict resolution and policy research on issues confronting our nation and the world. We encourage students, policy makers and anyone with an interest in President Clinton, presidential history as well as today's domestic and foreign policy issues to enjoy the site. AT A GLANCE On May 10, 2002 President Clinton hosts the 2nd Clintonstaff.</td>
