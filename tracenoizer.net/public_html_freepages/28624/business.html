 Using FullArmor Zero Administration clients and Network Configurator server software, unique policies and protection were established for each user to deliver lower TCO, reduce errant end user changes to standards, and maintain compliance. The policy rollout started with a pilot with the LUC IT department, which was successfully followed with an end user pilot involving 100 local users This pilot program allowed the group to appropriately refine the policies and develop full-scale implementation plans. After a few refinements, the LUC IS department deployed the policies to each business unit, one at a time. The complete implementation of Full Armor on 10,000 PCs took 3 months. Standard configurations are assured while updates and upgrades are maintained.</td>
