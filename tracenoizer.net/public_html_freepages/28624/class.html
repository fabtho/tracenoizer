 -- Robyyan Torr d'Elandris Kapellenberg, Windmaster's Hill Atlantia Dennis R. . Its a repeat of the class I taught at the last University session in Windmaster's Hill. An ability to read music is helpful but not required - tabor pipe is quite easy to pick up by ear. Class size limited to 6, although if you bring your own tabor pipe in the key of C, I'll let that grow a little bit.</td>
