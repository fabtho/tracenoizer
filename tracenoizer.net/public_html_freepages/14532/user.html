 Unfortunately, the administration of networked PCs and thin clients leaves a lot to be desired. Solving problems for end users is often a full-time job for IT staff members, and they are constantly working just to maintain consistent desktop configurations throughout the organization. ScriptLogic solves this problem by delivering the configuration created for each user wherever they log in. Users can log in from any PC, running any Windows 32-bit OS, over any LAN, dial-up or VPN connection -- and instantly have access to their unique desktop configuration. TAKE CONTROL OF DESKTOP ADMINISTRATION ScriptLogic Professional is software you can use to manage your network's Windows workstations and applications more efficiently, thereby significantly reducing network administration costs.</td>

 .NET Peter McMahon Introduction Round about HTML 2 (circa-1995), there were no such things as client-side image maps. If you wanted to develop a web application that allowed the user to be sent to different pages according to where they clicked on an image, you would need to build the logic yourself in a server-side script. Of course, after the introduction of client-side image maps in HTML 3. 2, server-side image maps were effectively obsoleted - they offered no tangible advantages over their newer equivalent, but required the developer to put in significantly more effort.</td>
