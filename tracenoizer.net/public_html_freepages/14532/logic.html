 0 or later, or with other servers having XML parsing capabilities. For more information, see the Microsoft XML Web site. Now you can turn your business logic script procedures into reusable Component Object Model (COM) components that you can use in your Web applications, as well as in other COM-compliant programs. For more information, see Using Components and Objects. When a browser sends a cookie describing its capabilities (such a cookie can be installed by using a simple client-side script) you can create an instance of the Browser Capabilities component that retrieves the browser's properties as returned by the cookie.</td>

 The primary benefit of this script was concrete reinforcement of the initial exposure to concepts students had through lecture and textbook. . Experience with the Logic Module Script Experience with the Logic Module Script The script for the Theorem-Proving Modules was used in the laboratory section of the undergraduate introductory AI course at Temple University during the Fall Semester, 1993. Most of our students had little difficulty mastering the translation of simple declarative English sentences into predicate logic formulas. In a few cases, however, the script revealed that the original set of predicate logic formulas resulting from the translation was incorrect.</td>
