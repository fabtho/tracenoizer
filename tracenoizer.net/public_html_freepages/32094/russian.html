Moral measuring of public actions is undoubtedly, the merit of Russian culture. In Russia literature and philology became the basis of it and it is not only our writers' merit but also the fact that philology is the main peculiarity of our home culture.</td>

 Mendy gave Nazarov a big lesson ; he led the action with his jab and hook to the head ans body. As a champion, Nazarov reacted as a hurt man but still the challenger won with a fair decision on points. The 2nd world championship of the night was between Julien Lorcy and Alexander Alexandrov for the WBO title, unfortunetely, Lorcy was once again dominated on points by the russian Alexandrov. Lorcy was not in his best physical condition and finished exhausted. .</td>
