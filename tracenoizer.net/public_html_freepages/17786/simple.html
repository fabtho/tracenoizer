 A character may continue full auto fire even in Melee Phases where he has no actions. Having multiple actions in a Melee Phase does not increase the rate of fire of a weapon. Full auto fire will take precedence over all further actions a character has, with the exception of simple actions like talking or walking, until he ceases fire after which time other actions may occur. Automatic fire must begin on a Melee Phase when the character has an action but may be ended even if the character does not have an action by simply declaring the cessation. This penalty is cumulative even across Segments if fire is sustained.</td>
