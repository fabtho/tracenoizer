 Gregory the Great designated certain churches in Rome as stationes and recommended that on the more solemn festivals they should be made stations (stationes fieri) until the Hour of Sext, and at these same churches on the appointed days (statis dicbus) the faithful should assist at the Office. The stations have long since been abandoned and have left their trace only in the Missal, but in some instances the fast lasted longer and has been preserved even to modern times. (In the same way many think that on Station days we must not be present at the prayers of the sacrifices because the Station should be finished when the Lord's Body is received. ) Comparison of other phrases of the same author with this passage shows that the statio was celebrated on Wednesday and Friday, of each week, lasting until the ninth hour. The 69th Apostolic Canon enjoins the observance of a fast on these two days.</td>

Endeavour has been docked at the orbiting construction site since Saturday, but the two crews -- five men on Endeavour, three on the station -- are living in very different worlds. In the other, struggle has become the norm and friction between the flight crew and ground controllers is often heated. The hatches separating the two worlds will open on Friday, but only for a few hours, as the Endeavour astronauts deliver supplies.</td>
