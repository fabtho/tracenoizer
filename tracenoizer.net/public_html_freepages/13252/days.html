 . To aid in a retrieval and understanding of three such areas -- Embertide, Rogationtide, and Station Churches -- we include the following section. The Ember Days are four series of Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays which correspond to the natural seasons of the year. There was also a Jewish custom at the time of Jesus to fast every Tuesday and Thursday of the week. (And we now know that this biweekly fast is actually older than some books of the New Testament).</td>

 These prayers are printed annually and distributed to the cardinals and prelates who assist at the first Sistine chapel of Lent. . The ancient liturgical writers commonly apply the word statio to fast days, but a distinction must be made between jejunium and statio. Pamelius will not admit this distinction, but Cardinal Bona is less uncompromising and admits that though statio is sometimes identical with jejunium this is not an absolute rule. The statio came to an end at the Hour of None, but the jejunium was not broken till the Hour of Vespers, which is a notable difference.</td>
