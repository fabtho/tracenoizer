 HiDISC is designed to address the problem of increasing memory latency while taking advantage of instruction-level parallelism. .HiDISC - Hierarchical Decoupled Instruction Stream Computer HiDISC - Hierarchical Decoupled Instruction Stream Computer HiDISC is a hierarchical decoupled instruction stream computer that has a compute processor, an access processer (which feeds operands from the cache to the compute processor), and a cache management processor (which can prefetch data from memory into the cache). HiDISC is designed to address the problem of increasing memory latency while taking advantage of instruction-level parallelism. .</td>

 . However, the temperature and pressure in this model are considered to be constant. The dissolved waste B is only the total waste entering into the stream, and there is no soil corrosion on the banks of the stream. This waste B can be studied to determine the WasteCoef (k'''B) in the laboratory. The growth rate of a micro-organism is considered in the determination of the WasteCoef (see Suggested Exercises and Discussion Questions).</td>
