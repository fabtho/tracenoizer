 Lab-Air Units are designed to eliminate harmful fumes and annoying odors from the laboratory workplace. Electronic Air Purifiers produce a controlled level of Ozone electrically by converting molecules of Oxygen (O2 ) into molecules of Ozone (O3). Ozone, sometimes called activated oxygen, as part of the process of returning to oxygen, casts off its extra atom. That extra atom combines with the molecule of the odor's source and thereby destroys the odor by oxidation. Once Ozone's extra atom is consumed fresh air is left behind which was created by a natural process.</td>

Department of Education's Division of Adult Education and Literacy (DAEL), the NRS continues a cooperative process by state adult education directors and DAEL to identify appropriate learner outcomes for adult education. The NRS established a national accountability system for adult education programs by identifying measures for national reporting and their definitions, establishing methods for data collection, developing software standards for reporting to the U. Department of Education and developing training materials and activities on NRS requirements and procedures.</td>
