 The growth rate of a micro-organism is considered in the determination of the WasteCoef (see Suggested Exercises and Discussion Questions). In addition, the waste can be easily monitored, and there is not another entry point before or below the mixing point of waste B. At the mixing point, there is a complete mixing between waste B and water. There is also a constant velocity of the water flow in the stream. Therefore, the rate of oxygen absorption is only the interphase of the water's surface and air; there is no other mechanical or natural devices to increase the surface area of water.</td>
