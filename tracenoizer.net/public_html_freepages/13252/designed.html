 .HiDISC - Hierarchical Decoupled Instruction Stream Computer HiDISC - Hierarchical Decoupled Instruction Stream Computer HiDISC is a hierarchical decoupled instruction stream computer that has a compute processor, an access processer (which feeds operands from the cache to the compute processor), and a cache management processor (which can prefetch data from memory into the cache). HiDISC is designed to address the problem of increasing memory latency while taking advantage of instruction-level parallelism. ..</td>

 .The System that destroys the odors and fumes and doesn't just mask them. Lab-Air Units are designed to eliminate harmful fumes and annoying odors from the laboratory workplace. Electronic Air Purifiers produce a controlled level of Ozone electrically by converting molecules of Oxygen (O2 ) into molecules of Ozone (O3). Ozone, sometimes called activated oxygen, as part of the process of returning to oxygen, casts off its extra atom.</td>
