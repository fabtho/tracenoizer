 Lifelong learning opportunities will thus be created. . Fast tracking students from disadvantaged backgrounds into main stream Computer Science Fast tracking students from disadvantaged backgrounds into main stream Computer Science RJ Blignaut, IM Venter, DJ Cranfield Abstract A computer-based training (CBT) system was used to teach Computer Literacy to full-time students at the University of the Western Cape. This approach was successful in creating computer literate students as well as creating an opportunity for students from educationally disadvantaged schools to enter the Computer Science course. The students experienced this new approach to learning positively.</td>
