 Prior to this date a number of state societies were formed in the 1890's. These were led by the Sons of Revolutionary Sires, organized July 4, 1876 in San Francisco. The first Congress of the National Society was held in Louisville, Kentucky on April 30, 1889 which was the 100th anniversary of George Washington's taking of the oath of office of President of the United States. We support excellence in teaching of American history. We support research and preservation of historic material relating to the men and women who fought or gave service for Independence in the American Revolutionary War.</td>

 Monthly meetings are held by each branch at which talks of genealogical or local interest are given. Some meetings are devoted to discussions about family history problems and much helpful advice and assistance is given to members. Book stalls and the Society's library are available at most meetings. The Society publishes a quarterly journal entitled Metropolitan free to members, containing news of Society activities and project work, articles, correspondence and notification of new members and their interests. The Society also participates in a worldwide exchange of journals with other societies who are fellow members of the Federation of Family History Societies; news of the work of others is thus made available, and many useful contacts may be made available through this medium.</td>
