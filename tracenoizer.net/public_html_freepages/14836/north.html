 . Thirty years ago, the Academy established a series of small trusts in recognition of distinguished leaders who were deceased. In 1985, a formal entity was created, the Family Health Foundation of North Carolina, affiliated with the American Academy of Family Physicians' philanthropic arm. The evolution of transitioning to a public charitable trust was accomplished in 1990, when the North Carolina Academy of Family Physicians Foundation was recognized by the IRS as a 501(c)(3) public charity. Advocacy and educational programs of the Academy and Foundation ultimately improve health care for all citizens of North Carolina.</td>
