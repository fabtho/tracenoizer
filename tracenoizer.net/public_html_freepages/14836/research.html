Our own ordinary families have produced many interesting characters; the trooper who fought in the Crimea at the Battle of Balaclava the butler who became a man of property the Quaker who inherited, and lost, a fortune (such is life. ) Who knows what stories lie behind your family tree. And if you haven't the time to research for them yourself, or live too far away, our genealogical research services are just what you need. We offer a reliable, conscientious and thorough service, based on our fifteen years experience of genealogical research. No travelling expenses are charged for records held here in Northallerton (North Yorkshire County Record Office and County Library headquarters).</td>

 Our objective is to foster interest in family history with special reference to families who have roots in the North of Ireland and their descendants, wherever they may be. The NIFHS is a voluntary, non profitmaking organisation, depending on the financial support of amateurs doing Family History and volunteer effort in running the society. The society is not a Research Agency, although we do like to put people in contact with one another. Each Branch has a varied programme of monthly meetings with specialist speakers, research evenings, trips to record offices, visits to our Library etc. The members are very friendly, and the more experienced are glad to help the inexperienced.</td>
