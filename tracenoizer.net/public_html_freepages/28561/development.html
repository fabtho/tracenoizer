 It is the responsibility of the OLMS to take action concerning questioned materials that have been evaluated and purchased for an individual school LMC. Selection An awareness of multicultural diversities and learning modalities are major considerations in the selection of all Library Media Center (LMC) materials. The Maryland State Board of Education has issued guidelines to assist in the selection of materials concerning proper recognition of ethnic and cultural minorities, elimination of sex stereotyping, and family life and human development. Rejection is a professional judgment that some aspect of the materials makes it unsuitable for use in our schools. The Textbook Office coordinates all issues in regard to classroom instructional materials.</td>
