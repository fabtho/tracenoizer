 At Erisco-Bauder we refuse to accept it, and over the past years we have gradually built a list of Approved Contractors in whose work we have confidence, and with whom we are proud to be associated. We have dispensed with the problem of sub-contract labour by certifying the man on site as well as the company which employs him. Each installer is rigorously trained in the methods of applying our materials, and will not be issued with a Certificate of Approval until his skills are deemed to be of the required standard. The checking of certificates at the beginning of your contract will give you confidence in the installer working with our product. Clients receive the benefit of approved installer efficiency.</td>

 (see WAW, August 3, 1999) In a recent interview, Autogrill official Luciano Lufarelli explained that his company is not buying Host Marriott merely to gain the rights to concessions located in the U. "We are going to use all of their expertise to become a global player," he said. We are buying the company in terms of (obtaining) management skills and know-how. " Luffarelli assured there will not be "major changes" at airport concessions operated by Host Marriott Services. He explained that the two companies share a similar philosophy.</td>
