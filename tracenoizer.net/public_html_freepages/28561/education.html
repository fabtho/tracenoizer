 . Popkewitz University of Wisconsin-Madison Our conventional assumptions about school policy and evaluation are that schools are known and stable entities, and that the objectives and purposes of evaluation are relatively straightforward. Drawing initially on a Norwegian evaluation of Norway's educational system, this essay views the problems of policy studies and evaluation as related to social and cultural changes that produce ambiguity and uncertainty in the practices of education. Further, the object of inquiry in this essay is the structuring of educational knowledge. Central to this examination are the sociology of knowledge and postmodern political theories, asking about the categories, distinctions, and differentiations of schooling that govern problem-solving efforts to improve education.</td>

 We wanted students to experience the potential and possibilities for learning that are facilitated by technology and through international connections. Rather than just reading about how this might be done, we wanted to provide an opportunity for pre-service teachers and year 11 students to experience life in the Global Classroom first hand. As a result of advances in communication and information technologies, learners need no longer be bound by 'same time, same place' access to education, and teaching responsibilities in K-12 and post-secondary can reach beyond traditional school and campus boundaries. Through participation in this on-line project, pre-service teachers and students learned how the use of technology can add value to classes and enhance traditional classroom activities in an engaging way. Both Joanne and I seek to explore a range of methodologies to successfully prepare trainee teachers as facilitators of technology integrated learning across the curriculum.</td>

 It is the responsibility of the OLMS to take action concerning questioned materials that have been evaluated and purchased for an individual school LMC. Selection An awareness of multicultural diversities and learning modalities are major considerations in the selection of all Library Media Center (LMC) materials. The Maryland State Board of Education has issued guidelines to assist in the selection of materials concerning proper recognition of ethnic and cultural minorities, elimination of sex stereotyping, and family life and human development. Rejection is a professional judgment that some aspect of the materials makes it unsuitable for use in our schools. The Textbook Office coordinates all issues in regard to classroom instructional materials.</td>
