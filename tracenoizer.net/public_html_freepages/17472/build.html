 Students' needs for well-grounded and adaptive teaching are what must ultimately define the standards for teachers. States would be expected to apply the standards at the juncture at which they issue a license which allows teachers to practice independently as teacher of record. Then states should consider whether changes in preparation are needed to ensure that teachers have the ability to engage in the kinds of learner-centered practices articulated by the standards and have the opportunity to build their developing practice on a solid foundation that will lead to higher levels of expertise. The related question is what distinguishes the beginning practice of a competent newly-licensed teacher from the advanced levels of teaching performance expected of a Board-certified teacher. We could not identify any area in which this approach would not seriously undermine the capacity of beginning teachers to develop their practice on a solid foundation.</td>
