 Teachers know the subjects they teach and how to teach those subjects to diverse learners. Teachers are responsible for managing and monitoring student learning. Teachers think systematically about their practice and learn from experience. These propositions, articulated in much more elaborated form in the Board's background documents, will provide the foundation for the Board's standards for advanced certification. In our work, the task force used the Board's elaborated propositions, which embody criteria for identifying excellent teaching, as the basis for exploring what beginning teachers ought to be prepared to know and be able to do in order to develop into a teacher with these capacities over time.</td>
