 . International Development Research Centre - Science for Humanity The International Development Research Centre is a public corporation created by the Canadian government to help communities in the developing world find solutions to social, economic, and environmental problems through research. The argument is over an industry that, some say, is threatening the environment and others feel is important to sustain their economy. Canadian geographer Brian Szuster and a team of academics is helping resolve the issue of shrimp farming. His cheerful demeanour belies the enormous challenge posed by the fight against poverty, the focus of his research and his daily work.</td>

 While the program accommodats large numbers of students, VMSM educators create an intimate atmosphere by moving among the audience engaging students in a minds-on exploration that is sure to please. TRUCK TOURS Following the assembly program, venture inside the Ocean in Motion truck. Your students will be submerged in an underwater environment beginning with seagrass beds of the Chesapeake Bay and ending in the depths of the Atlantic ocean. The blend of life-like habitats and saltwater aquariums makes it difficult to know where the exhibit ends and the water begins as students are able to see fish and invertebrate species found in the waters of Virginia. TOUCH TANKS An "underwater" experience would not be complete without getting a little wet.</td>
