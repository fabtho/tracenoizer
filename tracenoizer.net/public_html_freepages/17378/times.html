 As noted above, the estimation of and can require vast amounts of data. If, however, interspike intervals (ISIs) in the output spike train were independent, then the entropies could be simply expressed in terms of the entropy of the associated ISI distributions. The advantage of using ISIs rather than spike times is that H(T) depends only on the ISI distribution p(T), which is a univariate distribution. This dramatically reduces the amount of data required. In the sequel we assume that spike times are discretized at a finite time resolution .</td>

 Most of the contained nutrients are powerful antioxidants and free radical scavengers, or are needed by the body to make endogenous (produced by the body) protective compounds. Not to be used in the treatment of disease or medical condition. Take 1 serving (4 capsules) 3 times a day immediately after meals as a dietary supplement. Do not take the three servings (12 capsules) all at one time. Fourth Week and thereafter - use four capsules after each meal.</td>
