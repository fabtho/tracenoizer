 These are all 75GB drives and are recognized as such. This was fixed in the current patch and as discussed earlier on the linux-kernel mailing list by using mdelay(50). But after I had copied a large amount of data to the raid, about 17GB, the system crashed completely and could only be recovered by a cold reboot. Before using the latest patches, the system would usually crash after about 4-6GB of data had been moved. Let me know If I should post any additional information that might help in troubleshooting.</td>

 Any input would be appreciated, other then the pressure concerns this retro fit has been good so far and I have used the AC alot and it's better then when I bought it new. . I serviced it with 2oz can of ester oil and 3 cans of R-134a which should be about 80 percent of capacity for a 32oz R-12 system. The Low pressure only reads 20 and the high reads 285-300 it fluctuates alittle between these values but mainly in 285. Yes this was a conversion kit but all is working fine the clutch on the compressor cycles normally like before, awsome cold air out the vents, no air bubles in the sight glass etc.</td>
