 In the sequel we assume that spike times are discretized at a finite time resolution . The assumption of finite precision keeps the potential information finite. If this assumption is not made, each spike has potentially infinite information capacity; for example, a message of arbitrary length could be encoded in the decimal expansion of a single ISI. 8 represents the information per spike as the difference between two entropies. The distribution of ISIs can be obtained from a single long (ideally, infinite) sequence of spike times.</td>
