 Now it is possible to align an operating kiln precisely. . The Direct Method The kiln must be aligned so that flexing and distortion of the kiln shell are minimized and that loads to the support bearings are properly shared . Flexing and distortion of the kiln shell vastly increases mechanical wear and tear and can severely reduce refractory brick life. Poor load sharing amongst the supports leads to roller and bearing problems as well.</td>

 Direct methods use another form of the expression eq. The first term measures of the variability of the spike train in response to the ensemble of different inputs, while the second measures the reliability of the response to repeated presentations of the same inputs. The direct method has two advantages over the reconstruction method in the present context. Although the optimal linear reconstructor is straightforward to estimate, the construction of more sophisticated (i. Second, it provides an estimate of information that is limited only by the errors in the estimation of and ; the reconstruction method by contrast provides only a lower bound on the mutual information that is limited by the quality of the reconstructor.</td>

 The Variations window simplifies all the brightness, contrast, and color corrections into a visual display - just pick the one that looks best. When precise, professional-style corrections are needed, the Histogram and Tone Curves windows give total control. Whichever correction method is selected, a preview is always displayed so changes can be viewed in real-time. Using the Job function eliminates the need for complicated calculations - simply select the desired output category and page size, then the scan settings are finished. The Speed 's Job function has 150 easy-to-understand settings.</td>
