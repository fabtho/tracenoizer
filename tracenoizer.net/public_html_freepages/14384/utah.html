 . Hailed a "visionary" by the Utne Reader, Terry Tempest Williams is a passionate advocate for the preservation of the American Western wilderness. Citizens of Utah, and across the nation, took time away from work and family to personally meet with their members of Congress, and educate and lobby about the need to designate wilderness. Citizens also lobbied for passage of America's Redrock Wilderness Act, the bill before Congress to designate over 9 million acres as official wilderness in Utah. Some copies of RED were also delivered by SUWA's Washington, D.</td>
