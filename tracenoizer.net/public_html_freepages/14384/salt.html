 . When her book begins, Williams' mother has just been diagnosed with ovarian cancer, and the book follows the next five years of her life and death. At the same time, the Great Salt Lake is rising to record heights, flooding the Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge and scattering the birds and animals with whom Williams has lived her life. CommentaryWith it's beautiful and poetic, yet clear and readable language, this book stands out as one of the best of the illness narratives. The contrast of nature acting on the Great Salt Lake, as detailed by maps and water measurements throughout the book, against the natural--or unnatural--cycle and death of Williams' mother and grandmother is set to add to each story.</td>

 . Her intimate connection with nature is expressed through her representation of the Utah wilderness. Williams grew up near the Great Salt Lake and is the sixth generation of a Mormon family whose men have laid pipes in the state's earth. Her religion is as much a part of her work as her womanhood and her location; the Mormon faith is responsible for incorporating respect for the land and community with respect for God. The author's connection with Utah is so great that it pains her to leave home in order to make public appearances.</td>
