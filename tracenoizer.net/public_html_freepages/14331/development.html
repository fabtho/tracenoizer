 They attended the conference that was held May 28-June 1, 2001, at Disney's Wide World of Sports (r) Complex and the Coronado Springs Resort in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. The conference featured "challenging and thought-provoking activities that will enable the student-athletes to become change agents at the colleges and universities and in their cities," according to an NCAA press release. The student-athletes were involved daily in group discussions about critical issues and joined in team-building exercises and leadership-development games during the five-day conference. Criteria for selection to the conference include the student-athletes' demonstrated ability and strong desire to be a leader and potential to benefit significantly from a leadership-development exercise. In order to be eligible, applicants must be in good academic standing and must have athletics eligibility remaining in the following academic year.</td>
