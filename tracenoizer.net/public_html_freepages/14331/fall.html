 Southern Maine's Jessie Becher took a one-hitter into the fourth inning, but the Corsairs rallied for a pair of runs to make it a 12-2 game on back-to-back singles by LaFrance and Lauren Johnson, an outfield error and an RBI single to right by Meghan Fenton. Neither team scored the rest of the way though, with Charbonneau (on in relief of starter Mary Beth Lima) pitching a hitless fourth and Becher setting the Corsairs down in order in the fifth after issuing a leadoff walk to Sara Erwin. Lima, who gave up 12 hits in three innings of work, took the loss and saw her record fall to 3-5. The game was called after the top of the fifth because of the 10-run mercy rule. "Southern Maine always has tough hitters and they showed it in both games," said Ritz.</td>
