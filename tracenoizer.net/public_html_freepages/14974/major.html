 The latter is an emerging bunyavirus found in the Amazon Basin which causes a febrile illness similar to dengue. Bob Fox and Stan Watowich of the Sealy Center for Structural Biology at UTMB. The flaviviruses are a group of positive sense RNA viruses that are of major public health importance and cause diseases such as dengue, yellow fever (YF), Japanese encephalitis (JE), and tick-borne encephalitis. One major target of our research is to understand the molecular basis of attenuation and immunogenicity of the very safe and efficacious YF live attenuated 17D vaccine virus. We are also investigating the potential of developing chimeric vaccines based on the attenuated YF 17D vaccine virus backbone and including immunogenic antigens of dengue and hepatitis C virus.</td>
