 . The cute little duck jumps in a cute little puddle. Read this story with your kids, then play related games. You don't have to have seen this particular episode of Between the Lions. You can also print this story to read away from the computer.</td>

 so I set that idea aside until I find someone who can supply me with a long synopis and good analyzation before trying it again. (I asked about "Cliff Notes" on the book, but no luck. For one thing, it's 33 pages long, that's 9 pages longer than normal and 3 pages longer than any Duck story I've yet done. Also, there is a lot of complex art, such as detailed tracings of custom-shot photographs taken around Helsinki for the scenes where Iku-Turso is running wild through town, from the train station to Senate Square. The Kalevala story will probably be published by in Europe around November 1999.</td>
