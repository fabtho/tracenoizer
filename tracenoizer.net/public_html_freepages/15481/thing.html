 After several days of Johnny doing both his chores and Sally's, he finally couldn't stand it any longer. He came to Grandma and confessed that he killed the duck. You see, I was standing at the window and I saw the whole thing. But I was just wondering how long would you let Sally make a slave of you. Perhaps He's wondering how long you'll let the enemy make a slave out of you.</td>

 so I set that idea aside until I find someone who can supply me with a long synopis and good analyzation before trying it again. (I asked about "Cliff Notes" on the book, but no luck. For one thing, it's 33 pages long, that's 9 pages longer than normal and 3 pages longer than any Duck story I've yet done. Also, there is a lot of complex art, such as detailed tracings of custom-shot photographs taken around Helsinki for the scenes where Iku-Turso is running wild through town, from the train station to Senate Square. The Kalevala story will probably be published by in Europe around November 1999.</td>
