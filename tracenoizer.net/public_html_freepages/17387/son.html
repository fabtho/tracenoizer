 Rachael Cureton played Sandra with single-minded determination, which was the perfect foil to Ben Sherriff's portrayal of the middle-class Tim, her boyfriend from the south who was intimidated by this monstrous scouse family. Kate Marsh played Sandra's mother Betty with great verve, bringing out the emptiness of a life spent outdoing her sister Reeny (played by Claire Wilson). Paul Culshaw was excellent as Reeny's disturbed son John, while Chris Pritchard played her car-obsessed husband Ted. The family was completed by the laid-back Vera (Steph Davenport), Tony Shannon as the drunken Tommy, and Michael Warren as Betty's hen-pecked husband, Syd. 's 'The Royle Family', but is infinitely superior to it because it dramatises Sandra's rejection of her family who are caught in a little claustrophobic world of materialism and futile dreams.</td>

 You are 2 very special people and this is my tribute to the 2 of you hope you like it Love You guys very much and miss you and hope to see you very soon. Mary Petersen,Muscatine Sun April 28 I was deeply saddened to hear of Jon Gettle's passing this past week. He was a classmate of our son's and Jon was also one of his best friends. Jon was a wonderful young man, he would do anything for you. Kids don't realize until it's too late in this case for instance what they've done, he had feelings too, we all do.</td>
