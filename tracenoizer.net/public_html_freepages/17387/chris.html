<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" Rachael Cureton played Sandra with single-minded determination, which was the perfect foil to Ben Sherriff's portrayal of the middle-class Tim, her boyfriend from the south who was intimidated by this monstrous scouse family. Kate Marsh played Sandra's mother Betty with great verve, bringing out the emptiness of a life spent outdoing her sister Reeny (played by Claire Wilson). Paul Culshaw was excellent as Reeny's disturbed son John, while Chris Pritchard played her car-obsessed husband Ted. The family was completed by the laid-back Vera (Steph Davenport), Tony Shannon as the drunken Tommy, and Michael Warren as Betty's hen-pecked husband, Syd. 's 'The Royle Family', but is infinitely superior to it because it dramatises Sandra's rejection of her family who are caught in a little claustrophobic world of materialism and futile dreams.">
