 On to the Calgary Zoo, where they have life-sized dinosaur models displayed. A guide from the museum took us around, and there were great camera angles for snapping T. While there, the invertebrate paleontologist from the Royal Tyrrell met us, Dr. The next day (Friday), we drove off to the high country, with Dr. Johnston commenting on the spectacular geologic formations along the way.</td>
