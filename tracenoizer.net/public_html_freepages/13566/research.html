 All came from a sediment about 12 feet thick running for several hundred feet along the Dragon River. The project was funded by the National Science Foundation. Also taking part in the research were several University of Rochester students, including undergraduate Howard Scher and graduate student Rory Cottrell. Dubbing their tent city 700 miles from the North Pole the "Polar Hotel" after the tents they slept in, the students were among the first humans to explore some sections of the mountainous, rocky part of the Arctic. Experiences like this are plentiful at the University, where faculty both conduct world-class research and teach small classes of students.</td>
