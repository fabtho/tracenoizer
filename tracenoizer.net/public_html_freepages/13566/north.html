Iridium and other Pt metals were observed to be similarly enriched, relative to CI-chondrite, in the boundary layers, i. In the Gubbio section, the chemical composition does not change so much across the K-T boundary layer, except for Ir (and possibly other Pt group elements) and is very similar to that of the ''North American shale composite (NASC)''. Arsenic and Sb were observed not to be anomalously enriched in the Gubbio K-T boundary layers. This implies that their abundances cannot be a clue in elucidating an event which must have happened at the K-T boundary period.">
