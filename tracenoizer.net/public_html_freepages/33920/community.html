 AG Bell's Leadership Enrichment Adventure Program (LEAP) is our premiere leadership program for college students with hearing loss. The program will take place from June 4-8, 2003 at Georgetown University in Washington, DC. This is a great way to instantly network with other members of the AG Bell community. In another ruling in Ohio, the Avon School District was found responsible for the costs of mapping and audiological testing services for a student with a cochlear implant. .</td>
