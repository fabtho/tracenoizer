 Another compendium posted by Manfred Schneider and Georg Odenthal contains an updated list of links on Object-Oriented Patterns. We include links to the first web sites that presented more extensive information on the impact of Christopher Alexander's ideas on computer science; by now there are many others. Brad Appleton gives a lengthy essay on the development and definition of Pattern Languages. Doug Lea provides a detailed overview of the Pattern Language approach to Object-Oriented programming. He has also posted a general patterns discussion from the programmer's viewpoint.</td>
