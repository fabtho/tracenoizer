 Careful consideration of the risks and opportunities presented by entrepreneurial action in the world hop market has determined the actions of the Barth family and the Barth company for over 200 years. In order to strengthen our links with our customers and document the influence of our product range on the final product, beer, the company Hopfenveredlung St. KG, of which Barth is the majority shareholder, has built a 200-liter research brewery and adjoining visitor centre. The main objective of this pilot brewery will be to stimulate the brewing industry's interest in hops as a raw material. The wide range of new hop varieties and products provides ample reason for this.</td>
