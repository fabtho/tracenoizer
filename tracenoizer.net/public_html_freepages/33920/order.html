 They see themselves - as did all the generations of Barths before them - as a group sharing common interests and risks. Careful consideration of the risks and opportunities presented by entrepreneurial action in the world hop market has determined the actions of the Barth family and the Barth company for over 200 years.

The main objective of this pilot brewery will be to stimulate the brewing industry's interest in hops as a raw material.</td>
