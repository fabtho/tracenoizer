 This process will use the National Board's standards, accepted standards for student outcomes K-12 and this conception of common knowledge as its reference points. As an integral part of this process, the Committee will also work on the development of assessment prototypes for evaluating the achievement of these standards. The intent of this document, and those which will follow, is to stimulate dialogue among the stakeholders of the teaching profession about the best thinking of their colleagues regarding what constitutes competent beginning teaching. Our work is offered to state education agencies and institutions concerned with the professional development of teachers as a resource to revisit state standards for training and licensing new teachers, and to consider ways these models might enhance their system. We invite and encourage your comments on this draft.</td>
