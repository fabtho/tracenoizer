 Practical Uses of Math and Science, on-line journal of math and science examples for pre-college education. . Planetary Science Research Discoveries (PSRD) is an educational site sharing the latest research on planets, meteorites, and other solar system bodies being made by NASA-sponsored scientists. PSRD is a vital link for education, planetary and space science, and for learning how science works.

 com I'd like to thank Jeff Moe for the authoritative (no pun intended) information on his website, and his email help when I got stuck. You now have enough knowledge to confidently approach a simple Linux troubleshooting situation. You might have heard DNS stands for Domain Name System. The best way to do that is to assemble all our tools, make sure we're starting with as clean a slate as possible, and know what to do when things go wrong. Linux comes with vi, emacs (and if you understand emacs you're smarter than me), jed, and Wordstar-like joe.</td>
