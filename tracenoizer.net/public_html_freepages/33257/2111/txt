 They are based on analysis and structuring of the environment, and can help to identify issues and difficulties. But realistic problems are compositions of elementary problems. Practical problem analysis and structuring is based on recognising the elementary subproblems of which a realistic problem is composed, and the concerns that must be addressed to solve each subproblem. The composition of subproblems itself raises fresh issues and difficulties, both in analysing problems and in constructing solutions. Identifying these difficulties, and developing a standard repertoire of techniques to overcome them, is the classic process by which traditional engineering disciplines and their products become mature and reliable. In the past two or three years we have been working on Distributed Feature Composition (DFC), a new approach to specifying telecommunications features in a modular way. This approach is in use in the ECLIPSE project to support development of a service creation environment for multimedia IP telecoms. We are currently working on the relationship between problem structure and architecture, and on the effective treatment of inconsistency. Some of this work expands and improves the Problem Frames approach. Describes the company*s approach to specifying and building workflow systems for financial and other applications. Describes some ideas relevant to the earlier stages of software development. These are chiefly ideas about problem analysis and description of the problem context.
