 Read it, and, if you want, make your own comments known in my discussion forum. News, pictures, film clips, song clips of both released and rare tunes -- the works. 9 WMJJ Jam FM and hook up with some RealAudio-powered mixes of MJ's music. Also, I've put up links to other web sites that have pictures of Michael, plus links to pages that have whole lists of links to other Michael Jackson web sites. These are from the 1970s to the 1980s, from the Jackson Five of Motown to The Jacksons of Epic Records.</td>
