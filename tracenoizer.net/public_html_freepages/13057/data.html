 . Fixed Point Clustering can produce overlapping, non-exhaustive clusters. Fixed Point Clusters are data subsets which do not contain any outlier, but all other points of the data set are outliers w. (There was a request to class-l to get a software that can cope with collinearity. ) FIXREG is a software for finding linear regression clusters.</td>

 Frank Hampel Department of Mathematics Seminar for Statistics Prof. However, while the Normal assumption may be adequate for one or more homogeneous. parts of the data, usually not all data points fit to a Normal component. Instead, a contamination model seems to be useful, where a single cluster is modeled as Normal but the rest of the data can be arbitrary, if only well separated from the cluster. Such Normal clusters can be found by iterative reweighted computation of non-outlier regions (fixed point Clusters).</td>

 .de Finding clusters in large datasets is a difficult task. Almost all computationally feasible clustering methods are familiar to k-means and need the data to have the structure of some standard mixture model. Fixed Point Clustering (Hennig (1998) is different, because it only looks for one cluster at a time according to a mixture of a cluster prototype distribution P (e. Normal) and a distribution Q of arbitrary form, but separated from P, for the rest of the data.</td>
