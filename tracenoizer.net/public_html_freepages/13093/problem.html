 Have you had "a friend" who "Knows all about computers" try to fix it for you. If you read the manual, do you think you understood it. If 'Yes' then explain why you can't fix the problem yourself. _________________________________________________________________________ _________________________________________________________________________ 17.

 CoordSys transform ( CoordSys cs ) ; This function applies the reverse of the current coordinate system on the passed coordinate system. . For example, finding out how high a humanoid's heel is from the floor is the original problem I had in mind. A more direct solution would be to use proximity sensors with large sizes to detect the position. One proximity sensor can placed at a fixed position, say (0, 0, 0).</td>
