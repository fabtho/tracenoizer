Many of these problems can be prevented by blocking, or restricting, these services at the router or firewall that connects a local area network to the public Internet. As this is a "default-permit" approach it cannot protect against new attacks and should not be regarded as a long term measure, however a number of sites have reported a considerable decrease in security incidents as a result of restricting access from the Internet to a very small number of services.

 Primary functions have included engineering management, software design management and software commercialization activities. Current design management of operating system technology that includes new core platforms for monitoring, capturing and analyzing text in any form of from any source. New application designs include Cyber Sentinel child protection software; a content-based monitoring system designed to control sexually explicit Internet traffic by alerting parents to potential problems via e-mail. Newly completed designs include software to perform application, file and directory access control, time management and desktop security for personal computers, and software to reinforce Acceptable Use Policies. Founded in 1997, the company is successfully developing new technological solutions to security and safety issues related to on-line accessibility.</td>
