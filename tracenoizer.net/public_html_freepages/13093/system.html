 The proximity sensors will give the position of the viewer in relation to themselves. the position of the viewer from one known and one unknown position to determine the unknown position. The position of the viewer is given in relation to the coordinate system of the proximity sensor. While two sensors may have the same scale, they have different positions and, more importantly, different alignments. The relative position of a coordinate system in relation to another coordinate system can be expressed as a translation to make their origins coincide followed by a single rotation to make their axes coincide.</td>
