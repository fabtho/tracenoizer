As much as there is concern about the Year 2000 problem associated with many computers being unable to roll over from 1999 to the year 2000 and deal with a number of specific date and calendar issues, there is as great or greater concern about the wide range of equipment devices which increasingly contain microchips that silently and invisibly perform discrete functions. The failure of some embedded systems may be inconvenient; the failure of others can be catastrophic. The three articles referenced below provide a comprehensive understanding the issues involved, the kinds of devices which contain embedded systems, the scope of the problem, and those that present the greatest risk. .</td>
