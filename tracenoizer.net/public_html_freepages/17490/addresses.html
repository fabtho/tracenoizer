 Persistent connections and pipelining, however, do not fully address the rendering nor the fairness problems described above. The solution to these problems requires two actions; either by itself will not entirely discourage opening multiple TCP connections to the same server from a client. RED also addresses queue length problems observed in routers today. Development and deployment of a multiplexing protocol for use with HTTP (and eventually other protocols), so that multiple objects from a web server can be fetched approximately simultaneously over a single TCP connection, so that the metadata to objects can be sent to clients without other metadata waiting for the rest of the first object requested. This document describes such an experimental multiplexing protocol.</td>
