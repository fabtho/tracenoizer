 The TELNET connection is used for the transfer of commands, which describe the functions to be performed, and the replies to these commands (see the Section on FTP Replies). Several commands are concerned with the transfer of data between Hosts. The transmission and representation are basically independent but "Stream" transmission mode is dependent on the file structure attribute and if "Compressed" transmission mode is used the nature of the filler byte depends on the representation type. DATA REPRESENTATION AND STORAGE Data is transferred from a storage device in the sending Host to a storage device in the receiving Host. Often it is necessary to perform certain transformations on the data because data storage representations in the two systems are different.</td>
