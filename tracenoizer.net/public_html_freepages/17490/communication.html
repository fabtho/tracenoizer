 server-FTP process A process or set of processes which perform the function of file transfer in cooperation with a user-FTP process and, possibly, another server. The functions consist of a protocol interpreter (PI) and a data transfer process (DTP). server-PI The protocol interpreter "listens" on Socket 3 for an ICP from a user-PI and establishes a TELNET communication connection. It receives standard FTP commands from the user-PI, sends replies, and governs the server-DTP. TELNET connections The full-duplex communication path between a user-PI and a server-PI.</td>
