 Contact Information For information, the beer game, bibliography of System Dynamics, or older back issues of our journal please contact Roberta L. . In fact it has been used to address practically every sort of feedback system. While the word system has been applied to all sorts of situations, feedback is the differentiating descriptor here. Feedback refers to the situation of X affecting Y and Y in turn affecting X perhaps through a chain of causes and effects.</td>

 If you send mail to that address we will figure you're an abuser and block your future mail. . We search for all operating system names exactly as shown above, with the exceptions of Mac OS, Mac OS X, and VMS. For Mac OS, we add the search results for the incorrect but common spelling "MacOS". Because Mac OS X is sometimes abbreviated to simply "OS X", the Mac OS X search is just for "OS X" -- we have not found other instances of this term on the web, so we can use it without confusion.</td>

 Additionally, we try to produce and distribute usable versions of the developed software. 5, a synthetic real-time application for measuring scheduling behavior. 3, the Active Network Transport System, with new optimizations and many other improvements. 0, with new security features, other improvements, and new documentation. Patrick's Day'' snapshot-20020317, the Janos NodeOS, with many improvements and bug-fixes.</td>
