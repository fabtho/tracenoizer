 im wicky wacky on the go from coast to coast across water with pigments changing in the light. looking forward from memories of clay and water fights in amphitheatre's and the curtain. Director of Development at the Pacific Crest Outward Bound School. Although our main office is in Portland, OR, I'll be working out of the San Franciso office. I'm really excited about this transition because of the strong closeness I have to its mission and values.</td>
