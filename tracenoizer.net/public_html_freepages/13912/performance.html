 The course will include regular attendance at showings of current films and occasional discussions with film directors or producers. Special attention to body awareness, partner communication and movement efficiency. Performance presentation required at the end of the course. These will most likely include offerings in the humanities and social sciences. Study of the structure of the language on the most advanced level, with particular emphasis on comparing the syntactical properties of Spanish and English.</td>

 If EMI is present, steps should be taken to create electromagnetic compatibility (EMC). EMC is the ability of a device, equipment, or system to function satisfactorily in its electromagnetic environment without introducing intolerable electromagnetic disturbances to anything in that environment. In the document the customer specified a particular brand of 100 ohm unshielded twisted-pair (UTP), high performance cable to be used in the installation. The installation was to support a subscriber line (SL1) private branch exchange (PBX) with digital telephones and an IBM AS400 minicomputer. The customer wanted to eliminate twinaxial cable and use only 100 ohm UTP cable.</td>

 Litigation of these issues is commonly marked by the substantial judicial deference paid to academic institutional decision making. And even if it does, this approach has not been used in any other circuits. The case does, however, illustrate the general judicial deference to performance criteria set by academic insti tutions.
