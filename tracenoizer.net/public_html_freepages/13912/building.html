 The WebTexan Frerking Subpoenaed; Demonstration Photos Sought SHONDA NOVAK and GARDNER SELBY Daily Texan Staff March 21, 1980 The Daily Texan editor and an Austin television news director Thursday were subpoenaed by county officials to produce videotape and photographs taken of students protesting a speech by a former Iranian ambassador to the United Nations. Austin news media recorded and photographed hostile protests which resulted in the arrests of 27 foreign students at a Jan. 31 speech by Fereydoun Hoveyda at the Texas Union Building. Charges were filed last month in County Court-of-Law No. 3 against 24 protesters for disruption of an organized event.</td>

 The installation was to support a subscriber line (SL1) private branch exchange (PBX) with digital telephones and an IBM AS400 minicomputer. The customer wanted to eliminate twinaxial cable and use only 100 ohm UTP cable. The cabling was to be installed in a six-story building located in an office park in the southeastern part of the country. There were no unusual problems from industrial machinery, motor generators, and the like. It appeared that as long as one followed proper installation practices, the project should be a snap.</td>

 One of the fortunate survivors of the brutal attacks was Kevin Szott, 2000 Paralympic judo gold medalist. Szott, who is legally blind, is a benefits coordinator for the Hartford Insurance Co. and was in his office in Building 5 of the World Trade Center complex on September 11th. He was helped out of the building by a co-worker and was uninjured. USA Judo and Indiana Judo did a nice job coordinating a very well run event.</td>
