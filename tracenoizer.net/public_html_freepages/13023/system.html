 Bastian has been responsible for a wide range of software and hardware development tasks over the past 20 years. Primary functions have included engineering management, software design management and software commercialization activities. Current design management of operating system technology that includes new core platforms for monitoring, capturing and analyzing text in any form of from any source. New application designs include Cyber Sentinel child protection software; a content-based monitoring system designed to control sexually explicit Internet traffic by alerting parents to potential problems via e-mail.

 The duration of calculation for a signal length of 20 seconds is about 10 seconds on a 233 MHz-Pentium II-processor. Due to the selected construction the levels on the receiving side are quite low (about 40 dB lower than the original sound sources). Please adjust the volume control of your system so that the stated levels of the source signals match with your listening experience.

 Bastian came to Kennedy Krieger Institute in the summer of 2001. Research Summary Movement disorders commonly occur following neurological damage. Bastian and her colleagues study the movements of adults and children who have damage or disease of the central nervous system. Her group is interested in understanding the mechanisms of different types of movement disorders, as well as how and why different treatments improve movement. Ataxia resulting from cerebellar damage is extremely difficult to treat; often interventions are limited to physical therapy and exercise.</td>
