 " (One perennial project is to transform the dissertation into an academic monograph. ) I am, perhaps, best known as a chronicler of the lively Nigerian popular press. Over the past several years I have been pursuing an interest in Nigerian immigration to the west and have engaged in something still rather new for anthropologists, "cyberethnography. " Having followed my Nigerian friends back to the United States, l also followed them onto the internet and World Wide Web-where they are developing a very interesting presence as "Naijas," or virtual Nigerians. I am working on an historical project as well, which has to do with what I'm calling the "regendering" of Onitsha through missionization and colonialization from the mid-1800s to 1930.</td>
