 Bill brings with him over a decade of personal and team coaching. Bill has traveled extensively throughout the United States, Southeast Asia, Canada, and has intimately explored the coastal waters of British Columbia and South East Alaska on a sixty-eight day kayaking expedition through remote regions of the Inside Passage. Bill's stories and teachings reach deep into the human psyche, revealing the amazing potential within each of us to achieve any vision we set for ourselves, our families, or our communities. Directors of higher educational institutions such as Saint John's University in Minneapolis and Saint Benedictis College utilize these workshops to not only boost morale, but to also give each participant an insight to setting career and personal goals. Bill Bastian creates an intimate and safe environment to explore the self, move through barriers, fears, and anxieties to build a clear direction of living and working.</td>

 The closest thing on the show to cat politics are the two dogs, Stinky and Nunzio. Stinky and Nunzio mostly spend their time laying on the couch or the floor sleeping, so it's pretty easy to ignore them (however, he is now pointing out to me that I do a lot of the same here at home, but we all know that my motivations are completely different). A real cat is better than a human pretending to be a cat any day. Maybe we cats and dogs aren't so different after all. Anyways, there's a lot more to this show than I can ever cover in one little review.</td>
