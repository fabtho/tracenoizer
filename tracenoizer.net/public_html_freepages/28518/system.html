By default, the showdumps command shows all dumps on all unexpired tapes if you're on the CIS Unix systems. Other systems just show the (unexpired) dumps performed on the local system.

If you're just interested in a single filesystem (as you usually are), you can also pipe the output though tail to get the information on the most recent dumps.">

 . Systems are not just about computers or electronics but about things in general. Physicists these days will argue that the vacuum of space is a system and proceed to posit much about its properties; not that it will make much sense to the rest of us. Curiously, many systems problems starting with what would appear to be trivial circumstances lead one on merry chases indeed when trying to fathom them. Similarly, many systems with seemingly overwhelming size and numbers of interactions can sometimes be analysed simply with high accuracy.</td>
