 NetSpective WebFilter is a high-performance, firewall-independent network appliance that allows filtering to be handled from a central location instead of at every PC. This design simplifies installation and maintenance and ensures filtering cannot be bypassed at the local workstation or web proxy. NetSpective Reporter is a comprehensive Internet access reporting application. NetSpective Reporter gathers native data from firewalls, proxy servers and NetSpective WebFilter and transforms Internet access and bandwidth information into valuable management reports. These reports are grouped to address the inherent risks that organizations face from Internet abuse-legal liability, adverse publicity, bandwidth waste and lost productivity.</td>
