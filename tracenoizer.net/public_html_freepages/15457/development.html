 The remains had been tentatively identified as those of standing stones by English Heritage, who undertook a geophysical survey at the site earlier this year. This summer, a team of archaeologists from three British Universities has been trying to establish whether the geophysical features really represented lost stones. The excavation has also uncovered a ditched enclosure that almost certainly pre-dates the stone Avenue and may provide valuable clues about the early development of the Avebury complex. First identified on an aerial photograph, the excavation has established the earlier Neolithic date of this ditch, and that it was built from intersecting segments rather than as a continuous ditch. "The rediscovery of a major megalithic monument (the Beckhampton Avenue) has profound implications for our understanding of the Avebury complex and Neolithic society" said Dr Joshua Pollard (University of Wales, Newport) "We now know that, during the later Neolithic period, the scale of monument building in the Avebury area was much greater than had been previously suspected.</td>

 Formerly, I worked full-time as the Data Coordinator at the Office of Institutional Research, University of Arkansas. This experience was preceded by full-time employment at CAST where I served as Co-Principal Investigator for the Mississippi Alluvial Valley of Arkansas (MAVA) LULC Project. I continue to serve CAST and the University on a full-time basis through instruction of a senior level GIS for Business course, an introductory GIS course and geospatial data and web development. In 1988, impelled by the globalization trends of business commerce and the desire to develop international management and marketing skills I then relocated to Tokyo, Japan where I spent six years of continuous exposure to the Japanese business style and culture while working for Chuo Mapping and Teikoku-Shoin. .</td>
