It was relatively late in Sarah's career and the timbre of her voice never appealed to me. Then I was fortunate enough to hear on the radio a track from her 'Live at Mr Kelly's' album. This was made much earlier in her career and the difference in the sound of her voice is incredible. I started collecting her recordings from that day onward.">
