 Lighting for the decking is supplied by the company's Pharo uplights with ceramic metal halide bulbs. Providing dramatic floodlighting for the surrounding buildings and a chimney are HQI floodlights. Easy offered a simple solution and Moeller aided us in the programming of the units to exactly match our requirements. " Three Easy 412 AC Rs control the switching sequence of 130 courtyard lights including the concentric LEDs and metal halide flood lamps. The overall timing of when the lights operate is clock controlled with separate summer and winter regulating times.</td>
