 There has to be therefore widespread agreement between suppliers and recipients as to what bar code styles or schemes should be used. . Using bar code technology The use of bar code technology allows almost any data to be collected rapidly and with almost perfect accuracy. Bar code technology provides a simple and easy method of data collection by encoding text information that is easily read by many different inexpensive hand held electronic devices. To break down bar code technology lets start with the bar code itself.</td>
