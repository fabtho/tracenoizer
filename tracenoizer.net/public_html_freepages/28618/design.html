Students work through a series of steps to develop an experimental design, conduct an experiment and finally present their findings in a scientific presentation to the rest of their class. While undertaking this process, students are exposed to concepts such as symbiotic relationships and photosynthesis as well as scientific research skills such as data analysis and use of spreadsheets. The unit approaches the teaching of these concepts and skills from a constructivist standpoint.">

 Its main campus is located off the Holloway Road with the striking New Tower, designed by Rick Mather Architects, who were also responsible for much of the architectural regeneration along the South Bank. The courtyard architects Austin Smith-Lord's works include RIBA award winning Manchester Airport Railway Terminal and Liverpool's Peter Jost Enterprise Centre. Its in house design studio with AutoCad 2000 is able to provide customers with a complete design solution to their requirements. The company's wide portfolio of work includes lighting and power projects within The Millennium Dome and refurbishing Lakeside Shopping Centre, Thurrock. .</td>

 The pattern of reflected light is detected with a photodiode which produces an electronic signal that exactly matches the printed bar code pattern. Then the signal is then decoded back to the original data by electronic circuits. Because of the basic design of most bar code symbologies it does not make any difference if you scan a bar code from right to left or from left to right. The basic structure of a bar code consists of a leading and trailing "quiet zone", a start pattern, one or more data characters, (also may be included one or two check characters) and a stop pattern. See bar code terminology There are a variety of different types of bar code encoding "symbologies", each of which were originally developed to fulfill a specific need in a specific industry.</td>
