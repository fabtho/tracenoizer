 . The EPA designed and fabricated the DSS systems to evaluate and understand the dynamics which influence water quality within water distribution infrastructure systems in the United States and abroad. The first distribution system simulator (DSS-1) has continuous flow conditions. There are six individual 75 ft (25 meter) lengths of 6 in (15 cm) diameter ductile iron pipe arranged into "pipe loop" configurations to simulate a distribution system. DSS-1 is equipped with two 1500 gallon reservoir tanks to simulate a comprehensive distribution infrastructure system.</td>

 Awareness of this has led to an evolving international consensus on the importance of both increasing our scientific understanding of global change and linking scientific findings to policy decisions. The Role of the Arctic The Arctic is characterized by one of the most extreme environments on the planet, with limited sunlight, extreme temperatures, and a short growing season. In addition to being an indicator of change in the coupled Earth system, the Arctic plays a key role in many global processes such as global atmosphere and ocean circulation and includes potentially important sources and sinks of trace gases.
