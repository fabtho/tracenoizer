 Results will be used to develop and provide guidance on ways to maintain high levels of water quality through distribution systems. . The EPA designed and fabricated the DSS systems to evaluate and understand the dynamics which influence water quality within water distribution infrastructure systems in the United States and abroad. The first distribution system simulator (DSS-1) has continuous flow conditions. There are six individual 75 ft (25 meter) lengths of 6 in (15 cm) diameter ductile iron pipe arranged into "pipe loop" configurations to simulate a distribution system.</td>
