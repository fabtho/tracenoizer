 Here, we examine the most common mistakes, and discuss the benefits of using the Active Platform. By reading these pages, you will acquire a sense of what programming is about, an overview of the territory. They run thanks to the Cygwin library which provides the UNIX system calls and environment these programs expect. As a result, it is possible to easily port many significant Unix programs without the need for extensive changes to the source code. This includes configuring and building most of the available GNU software (including the packages included with the Cygwin development tools themselves).</td>
