 . My family fled communist Poland in 1969 because my parents were political dissidents. During the 1980s I supported the Solidarity Trade Union in various capacities. In fact, my godfather (Jan Olszewski) was the third post-communist Prime Minister of Poland. I interviewed him in 1992 for Multinational Monitor magazine.</td>

 Gomulka is deposed as head of Polish Communist Party and is replaced with Edward Gierek. The Soviet Union, through the Warsaw Pact, threatens intervention. He declares martial law, bans Solidarity and imprisons its leadership. This still widespread opposition to the Communist Party. Jaruzelski expects to remain the government leader under the power-sharing arrangement but a partially-free election resulted in a landslide vote for Solidarity candidates.</td>

 Ideologically, the PSL is moving in a conservative Christian Democratic direction. . The polarisation between the former communists and their allies on the one hand and the post-Solidarity-parties on the other hand is still dominant in Polish politics. It has been said, however, that in the socio-economic field a consensus exists among the political parties in Poland. All parties favour European integration, privatisation with a human face and economic reforms.</td>
