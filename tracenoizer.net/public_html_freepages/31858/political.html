 Waldemar Pawlak of the Social Democracy Party (SdRP), the reformed Communist Party, is chosen as the new Prime Minister. . A puppet government represnting a political coalition but dominated by Polish Communists is installed. There was an attempt to collectivize Polish agriculture as had been done in the Soviet Union in the 1930s. The problems of collectivization proved to be too great and agriculture remained private but with heavy state control and regulation.</td>

 . The polarisation between the former communists and their allies on the one hand and the post-Solidarity-parties on the other hand is still dominant in Polish politics. It has been said, however, that in the socio-economic field a consensus exists among the political parties in Poland. All parties favour European integration, privatisation with a human face and economic reforms. The main items are the speed and the form of the reforms.</td>

 In 1970 violent suppression of strikes and riots resulted in Gomulka being ousted and replaced by Edward Gierek. 1978 Polish Cardinal Karol Wojtyla was elected as Pope John Paul II and in June 1979 visited his homeland. In 1980 Stanislaw Kania replaced Gieredk as head of the PZPR after thousands of workers went on strike demanding economic and political reforms. In 1981 Wojciech Jaruzelski replaced Kania after economic problems increased and in December Martial Law was imposed until July 1983. 1984 Father Jerzy Popielizko, a pro Solidarity priest, was abducted and murdered.</td>
