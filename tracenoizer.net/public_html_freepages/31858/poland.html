 You certainly may disagree with me, but I would appreciate it if you did not resort to simplistic ad hominem attacks. . My family fled communist Poland in 1969 because my parents were political dissidents. During the 1980s I supported the Solidarity Trade Union in various capacities. In fact, my godfather (Jan Olszewski) was the third post-communist Prime Minister of Poland.</td>

 This still widespread opposition to the Communist Party. Jaruzelski expects to remain the government leader under the power-sharing arrangement but a partially-free election resulted in a landslide vote for Solidarity candidates. The Communist Party of Poland is dissolved and reorganized as the Social Democracy of the Republic of Poland Party (SdRP). Lech Walesa is elected President of Poland, the head of the Polish State. The elections to the Polish legislature, the Sejm, result in a fragmented politics.</td>

 . The polarisation between the former communists and their allies on the one hand and the post-Solidarity-parties on the other hand is still dominant in Polish politics. It has been said, however, that in the socio-economic field a consensus exists among the political parties in Poland. All parties favour European integration, privatisation with a human face and economic reforms. The main items are the speed and the form of the reforms.</td>
