 Wladyslaw Gomulka is made head of Polish Communist Party and he asserts that he will seek reform and liberalization of the economic system. Gomulka is deposed as head of Polish Communist Party and is replaced with Edward Gierek. The Soviet Union, through the Warsaw Pact, threatens intervention. He declares martial law, bans Solidarity and imprisons its leadership. This still widespread opposition to the Communist Party.</td>

 Two evergreen beds mark the spot where two graves containing their remains victims were found. Mourners placed small stones on top of the memorial in a traditional Jewish funeral gesture and a group of rabbis from different countries led the Kaddish, the Jewish prayer for the dead, which makes no mention of the deceased by praises God's greatness much like the Catholic Gloria. In May, the Polish Episcopate had prayed on its knees in Warsaw's largest church in a penitential gesture for the Poles who had wronged Jews, specifically mentioning "the atrocities committed in Jedwabne and elsewhere on Polish soil. " According to Jedwabne Mayor Krzysztof Godlewski, the people of Jedwabne were torn. On the one hand, some had felt an urge to participate in the ceremonies, but feared that doing so would be seen as an admission of guilt of a crime committed long before most of them were even born.</td>
