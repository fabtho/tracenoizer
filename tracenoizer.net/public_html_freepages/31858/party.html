 There was an attempt to collectivize Polish agriculture as had been done in the Soviet Union in the 1930s. The problems of collectivization proved to be too great and agriculture remained private but with heavy state control and regulation. Wladyslaw Gomulka is made head of Polish Communist Party and he asserts that he will seek reform and liberalization of the economic system. Gomulka is deposed as head of Polish Communist Party and is replaced with Edward Gierek. The Soviet Union, through the Warsaw Pact, threatens intervention.</td>

 The AWS is a strongly anti-communist grouping of some 30 centre and right wing parties and trade unions. Former opposition movement, Solidarity, forms the core of the alliance. Other major parties within the AWS are the Polish Christian Democrats' Alliance (PCchD), the Conservative Peasants' Party (SKL) and the Christian-National Union (ZChN). The AWS has a huge rural backing with some nationalistic and traditional conceptions. While in government, it seeks to find a balance between a social course and the necessary painful reforms in agriculture, education and health care.</td>

 Other ethnic minorities include Ukrainians, Belarussians, Germans and Jews. In 1947 the PPR won parliamentary elections and banned all opposition parties. In 1949 the Socialists and PPR united to form the Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR). The PZPR then embarked on socialist policies of industrial nationalization and the establishment of collective agricultural farms. In 1956 anti-government demonstrations and strikes, although crushed by troops, brought Wladyslaw Gomulka to power as head of the PZPR communist party which resulted in the abandonment of compulsory collective farms.</td>
