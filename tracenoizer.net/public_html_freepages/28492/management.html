 I have included the following statement, "A correctional facility depends on many systems to sustain the operation. In other words most problems are systems problems". This is a major lead statement in introducing a section on systems related to emergency management. However, we cannot find were this statement is made in Deming writtings. I would like to make an accurate reference in the article.</td>

 The consortia must demonstrate that they have access to the multidisciplinary skills required to undertake the project successfully. Projects will typically address the necessary RTD, demonstration and take-up measures. The partners which are committed to introduction of new ways of working in their organisation must have the full backing of the management and representatives of the workforce. The projects must enable human-centred decision making processes at all levels of the enterprise, and address the resulting training requirements such as the need to acquire new IT skills and the need to retrain experienced industrial workers. Projects must also take account of the changing business environment, in particular the distributed deployment of business processes.</td>
