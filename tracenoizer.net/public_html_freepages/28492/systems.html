 . My approach is to address this issue within the context of the organization. I have included the following statement, "A correctional facility depends on many systems to sustain the operation. In other words most problems are systems problems". This is a major lead statement in introducing a section on systems related to emergency management.</td>

 . Chargeback System Services - Mainframe, UNIX, and LAN chargeback specialists. Chargeback Systems Resource accounting, capacity planning, cost allocation, and chargeback systems are critical to the efficient management of any data center. Chargeback systems are designed to accurately and equitably allocate the cost of computing facilities to the various users of the service. Properly implemented, these systems provide the basis to chargeback the cost of existing IBM mainframe, UNIX open systems, and LAN based computer resources.</td>
