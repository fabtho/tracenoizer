 This Web site is meant to inform and educate you about end-stage renal disease and its treatments, and to supplement the information you are receiving from your health care team. . Since kidney failure patients need some form of treatment to replace the kidney's functions, finding the right treatment option-dialysis or transplant--to best suit your needs becomes a priority. More than 300,000 patients receive some form of dialysis and about 12,000 patients receive a kidney or kidney-pancreas transplant each year in the United States. Medical knowledge and technology are continually advancing to improve the efficacy of these treatments and to make other options available.</td>

 People with a certain genetic variant are only half as likely to suffer them after taking diuretic drugs, suggests their research. Raised blood pressure, or hypertension, over a long period of time increases the chance of hardened arteries, which in turn can contribute to heart attacks or strokes. Patients with the problem are often given various drugs to reduce the problem, including diuretics. These drugs work by forcing the kidney to get rid of excess salt, which is a well-known contributor to high blood pressure. Despite these treatments, some people still go on to have serious health problems.</td>
