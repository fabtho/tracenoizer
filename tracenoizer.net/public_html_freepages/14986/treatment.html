 This Web site is meant to inform and educate you about end-stage renal disease and its treatments, and to supplement the information you are receiving from your health care team. . Since kidney failure patients need some form of treatment to replace the kidney's functions, finding the right treatment option-dialysis or transplant--to best suit your needs becomes a priority. More than 300,000 patients receive some form of dialysis and about 12,000 patients receive a kidney or kidney-pancreas transplant each year in the United States. Medical knowledge and technology are continually advancing to improve the efficacy of these treatments and to make other options available.</td>

 Usually, at least one parent must have the disease for a child to inherit it. Symptoms usually develop between the ages of 30 and 40, but they can begin as early as childhood. A physician will establish a treatment protocol for autosomal dominant PKD only after careful consideration of the patient's symptoms and medical profile. Parents who do not have the disease can have a child with the disease if both parents carry the abnormal gene and both pass the gene to their baby. Symptoms of autosomal recessive PKD can begin before birth.</td>
