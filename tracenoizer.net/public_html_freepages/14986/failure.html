 Its intuitive interface and failure data graphing capabilities make it quite useful for estimating parameters and plotting failure data and confidence intervals. . Failure data analysis is the process of discovering the trends in product or system failure, and using them to predict future failures in similar situations. By learning these trends, you can attempt to correct or compensate for them, thereby improving product reliability. Failure data analysis can be used to study a variety of fields, practices, and disciplines.</td>

 Each year, there are an estimated 400,000 new cases. . NHLBI, Congestive Heart Failure Congestive Heart Failure Data Fact Sheet An estimated 4. 8 million Americans have congestive heart failure (CHF).

 For example, you might test 10 units in each trial and record the number of units that failed. . This success and failure data are what is commonly referred to as attribute data. This could be a one-shot item such as a missile, where it only gets fired once and it either succeeds or fails; or an entire system that either succeeds or fails. If this is the case, the reason for each failure could also be used.</td>
