"If they just have a suspect case they can enter that, and if someone else has a suspect case in an adjoining county, pretty soon that starts to form an epidemiological picture," Ward said. " A little over a year ago, similar reports would take days or weeks to reach the state. But the recent anthrax outbreak, prompted Florida's legislature to fund an expansion of Merlin. "Iinstead of waiting what may be two- or three weeks that we wait now for a laboratory result, we can have the results everyday from those labs," said Ward.">

 For a selected machine we can drill down to find out which failure modes are occurring most frequently and we can look for trends. . This type of analysis seeks to characterize the performance of a population of similar machines. We also look for the sensitivity of these values to specific failure modes and for the primary sources of uncertainty in these values.

April 9 was chosen for this drill because it is the 99th day of 1999, a number some computer programs might read as an error message. Electrical utilities nationwide are conducting similar tests tonight as part of ongoing preparations for the Year 2000. An industry group later will post results of the drills at www. The so-called "Y2K bug" stems from the fact that many older computers used only two digits to signify the year -- 99 for 1999, for example.</td>

Many of Forrester's conclusions are similar to my writings in the Alertbox since 1995 and the report provides additional supportive data from large corporate Web projects. For the report, Forrester interviewed 25 executives in charge of various companies' Internet efforts. ) Impact on the Company Forrester estimates several costs of bad Web design.</td>
