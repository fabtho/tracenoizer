<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" Growing evidence suggests that chronic infection with certain bacteria, such as the respiratory bug C. pneumoniae, plays a role in the development of artery blockages and in destabilizing these blockages to help trigger heart attack and stroke. Because of this, investigators have been studying whether bacteria-fighting antibiotics could help treat artery disease. The current findings clearly show that azithromycin can improve blood vessel function in coronary artery disease patients who carry C. But whether this benefit will translate into improvements in patients' artery disease and reduced risks of heart attack and stroke is far from clear.">

 Click here to view the Online Resources page of this web. . Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a genetic disorder characterized by the growth of numerous cysts filled with fluid in the kidneys. PKD cysts can slowly replace much of the mass of the kidneys, reducing kidney function and leading to kidney failure. PKD can also cause cysts in the liver and problems in other organs, such as the heart and blood vessels in the brain.</td>
