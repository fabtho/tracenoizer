 Protecting Patients and Professionals from Blood-Borne Diseases by Eleanor Mayfield Concern about transmission of AIDS and other blood-borne diseases during medical and dental treatment was heightened recently when a study found that the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can survive in dental tools that are not heat-sterilized. Scientists from the University of Georgia reported in the British medical journal The Lancet last November that they found traces of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, in dental instruments cleaned with disinfectant. The tools had previously been used to treat a dental patient who had AIDS. The scientists recommended that dental instruments be heat-treated between patient uses to eliminate the risk of transmitting HIV and other blood-borne viruses from one patient to another. FDA reached the same conclusion last September, two months before the University of Georgia study was published.</td>
