 How can we develop diesel engines that are more environmentally friendly. Did you ever wonder how the earth's magnetic field is generated. These ideas are being explored at the University of Maryland's Institute for Research in Electronics and Applied Physics (IREAP). Experimental and theoretical research and computer simulation are pursued in IREAP by 57 research scientists. Faculty members affiliated with IREAP are drawn from a variety of disciplines including electrical engineering, materials and nuclear engineering, mathematics, meteorology and physics.</td>

 Last updated Friday, July 14, 2000 Comments or questions. . American Heart Association Scientific Development Award American Heart Association Scientific Development Award The purpose of the American Heart Association Scientific Development Award is to support highly promising young scientists in their progress toward independence by encouraging and adequately funding research projects that serve to bridge the gap between completion of research training and readiness for successful competition as an independent investigator. Applications can be submitted for review in the final year of a postdoctoral research fellowship with the stipulation that the investigator have a full-time faculty appointment at the time of activation. The intramural programs at NIH can nominate up to seven applicants each year.</td>
