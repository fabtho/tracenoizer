 This system enables Eurobend to eliminate the requirement for a costly, bespoke PC cabinet. . TwinCAT provides PLC and NC motion control functions under Windows NT and, in a recent project, Eurobend has made use of this system to control the automation of a complete process line for one of its customers. Traditionally, to achieve effective automation of a line of this type, Eurobend would have had to use numerous handshaked PLC units and extensive hardwiring, as well as spending many hours on system programming. Easy access is another benefit, enabling alterations to be made for bespoke applications without the complex software modifications that were previously required.</td>

 Production machines can be located in another plant, another city, or another country. Even though the basic principles of open networking are the same, each company has added its own distinctive spin. Mazak's Mazatrol Fusion 640 machine tool control system can also be used as the basis for remote monitoring and on-line optimization. Hitachi Seiki's Seiki FlexLink provides access to the CNC via the ethernet connection. Versatile FlexLink software can be added to any control for enhanced usability without changing basic existing functions.</td>
