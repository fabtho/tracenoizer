 The results of this research are reported in our publications and implemented in useful software, like the Festival speech synthesis system. To find out more, read our list of current and recent research projects with links to more detailed information. students working individually and on collective projects. The Centre is part of the Department of Theoretical and Applied Linguistics and collaborates with many other groups both within the University and beyond. CSTR always welcomes applications from prospective Ph.</td>

 You learned about programming algorithms using recursively defined procedures---first you curse, and then you recurse. You learned how to do mathematical proofs, and how to multiply matrices and compute cross products. Well, you students didn't venture out into this risky unknown, fraught with the danger of showing how ignorant you were precisely when everybody was watching, just out of youth and curiosity. You have to---we make you---otherwise you can't graduate. This brings me to the first serious thing I want to say today.</td>

 ) This report aims to provide up-to-date information on academic and policy analysis of the returns to academic research. It shows the capabilities that firms need to develop, the key business challenges they face, and outlines the experiences of five leading case study firms. SPRU Annual Review - an overview of our research, teaching and other activities over the past year, including key research findings, select bibliographies and the work of DPhil students. The Annual Review should be of interest to fellow academics, policy-makers, journalists and prospective students. Also now available - a bibliography of SPRU-authored publications, January to December 2000.</td>
