 This system enables Eurobend to eliminate the requirement for a costly, bespoke PC cabinet. . TwinCAT provides PLC and NC motion control functions under Windows NT and, in a recent project, Eurobend has made use of this system to control the automation of a complete process line for one of its customers. Traditionally, to achieve effective automation of a line of this type, Eurobend would have had to use numerous handshaked PLC units and extensive hardwiring, as well as spending many hours on system programming. Easy access is another benefit, enabling alterations to be made for bespoke applications without the complex software modifications that were previously required.</td>
