 Mikhail DEGTIAR, Professor of sociology Gaining its independence with the fall of the USSR in 1991, Uzbekistan as well as other Central Asian states faced a number of particular problems due to the specifics of the local intelligentsia. Analogous situation appeared in the sphere of culture and fine arts with only slight deviations. So, relatively small fraction of the populace took an active part in economical, scientific and cultural life of Uzbekistan, assisting it in keeping up with the standards assumed in the former USSR by the beginning of 90s. It's a public knowledge that in the USSR existed a deep integration in all spheres of economical, scientific and cultural life. Scientists and researchers from different republics worked on the common projects, prepared specialists for each other, gathered for seminars and conferences.</td>
