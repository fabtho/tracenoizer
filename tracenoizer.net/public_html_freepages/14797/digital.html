A tawdry effect that dazzles and invokes fear among the masses. I made Info-receptor at a time when aspects of my life began to shift from analog to digital. Info-receptor is a flashy, low-budget, dim-witted, infomercial with a built-in sense of irony. I shot half on videotape and half on film, animating not only the subject but also dramatizing the slogging shift from analog to digital, sugar-coated with enthusiasm and ambivalence.">
