 While last month's event drew 80 lonely hearts to the 92nd Street Y, a comprable event last year drew only 51, Mr. Date Bait, originally formed as a gay singles event, is a mixer divided into three parts. In the first part, everyone in the room spend a minute introducing themselves to the group. Next, there is a half-hour mingling period, during which participants chat with the people they were eyeing during the intros. At the end, people enter into a computer the names of those whom they'd like to date, and the computer spits out the matches.</td>
