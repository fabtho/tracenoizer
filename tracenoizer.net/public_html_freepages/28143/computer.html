 The staff on the unit have a wide breadth of experience. They now use the most popular generic packages, word processors, databases, spreadsheets and desk top publishers as well as statistical packages which they still use for research. The Faculty has five networked computer rooms, containing over 90 computers for student use. Each student has an e-mail account and full access to the internet. There are laser printing facilities available to all students in the faculty and generally on campus.</td>

 In the first part, everyone in the room spend a minute introducing themselves to the group. Next, there is a half-hour mingling period, during which participants chat with the people they were eyeing during the intros.
