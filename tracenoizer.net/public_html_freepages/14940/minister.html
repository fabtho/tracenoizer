 The President presides over the cabinet, commands the armed forces, and concludes treaties. He is also empowered to dissolve the National Assembly and, in certain emergency situations, may assume full power. The President appoints the Prime Minister, but because France's political system is a hybrid of presidential and parliamentary elements, the composition of the National Assembly (the lower house of the French parliament) determines the party or political grouping from which the President must choose his Prime Minister. This has resulted occasionally in the head of state and the head of government being from opposing parties, in an arrangement known as "cohabitation". Currently, center-right President Jacques Chirac cohabits with a government of the left that was elected June 1, 1997 after the dissolution of the National Assembly.</td>
