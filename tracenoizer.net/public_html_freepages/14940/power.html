 But, if morality accepts the validity of at least some self-serving actions, then ipso facto political realism may be a moral political doctrine. . It takes as its assumption that power is (or ought to be) the primary end of political action, whether in the domestic or international arena. The theory is therefore to be examined as either a prescription of what ought to be the case, that is, nations and politicians ought to pursue power or their own interests, or as a description of the ruling state of affairs-that nations and politicians only pursue (and perhaps only can pursue) power or self-interest. Political realism in essence reduces to the political-ethical principle that might is right.</td>
