 . Systems is the largest research area in the Computer Laboratory covering hardware, communications hardware and software, operating systems and distributed systems. Past systems developed here include Edsac, the Titan operating system, the Cambridge Ring and the Cambridge Distributed Computing System. The thrust is open distributed processing with an object orientated approach. We look to support emerging distributed applications in which users and devices may be mobile and may have multimedia presentation requirements.</td>

 On the basis of these feasibility studies, an accelerator driven subcritical reactor was found to be the most promising candidate for the incineration of nuclear waste from nuclear power plants. KAERI is setting up a long-term research program called HYPER (HYbrid Power Extraction Reactor) and the HYPER program schedule was drawn up in July 1997. Figure 1 shows the basic concept of the HYPER system. KAERI launched the Korea Multi-purpose Accelerator Complex (KOMAC) program for basic science, as well as transmutation research and a back-end fuel cycle research program consisting of various fields like TRU separation. Thus, the HYPER program is focused mainly on developing subcritical blanket related technologies.</td>
