 The projects and publications links below lead to fuller information about this and other work in the group. . Systems is the largest research area in the Computer Laboratory covering hardware, communications hardware and software, operating systems and distributed systems. Past systems developed here include Edsac, the Titan operating system, the Cambridge Ring and the Cambridge Distributed Computing System. The thrust is open distributed processing with an object orientated approach.</td>

 Media Specific - Find databases and tools that apply to specific environmental media (e. water, air, land, pesticides) Integrated Media - Find tools that address the relationships of all environmental media. Geographic Information Systems - Information about systems and software used to support mapping of environmental data. Technical Tools - Find tools to assist in modeling environmental conditions, assessing water quality and more. EPA Models - Models are used to increase the level of understanding about natural systems and the way in which they react to varying conditions.</td>
