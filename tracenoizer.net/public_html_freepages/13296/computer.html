 Feel free to mail corrections, additions, or various comments to me. I still have some work to do, especially on commercial operating systems and real-time operating systems. After all, this is computer science, not real science. ..</td>

 5 hours), but during periods of high activity, they will be limited to 100 Mbytes. the files contain the data for all times, whether quiet or during a flare. Access to the files can be accomplished either by mounting (or sharing) the data directories from a local file server, or copying the files to your own computer. (In the future, the software will automatically search for data first on your own computer, then on a local archive, and then on one of the primary archives. ) In either case, you must define the environment variable HSI_DATA_ARCHIVE to point to the location of the data (see below).</td>

 The projects and publications links below lead to fuller information about this and other work in the group. . Systems is the largest research area in the Computer Laboratory covering hardware, communications hardware and software, operating systems and distributed systems. Past systems developed here include Edsac, the Titan operating system, the Cambridge Ring and the Cambridge Distributed Computing System. The thrust is open distributed processing with an object orientated approach.</td>
