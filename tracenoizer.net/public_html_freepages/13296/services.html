<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" This not an isolated problem for individuals, but affects the whole community. This increase of drug abuse among women causes increased risks of HIV infection to females; risk of children being born addicted to drugs and infected with the HIV virus; and increased risk of child neglect, abuse, and abandonment. Drug exposed infants and children are dramatically affecting the child welfare system, increasing the number of referrals to child protective services and foster care. These are new problems that are complex and require strategies and interventions that are not in place with the current overwhelmed child welfare system. Substance abusing families have different needs and the welfare workers are not trained to identify or treat all of these needs.">
