 There is also information available about how to proceed if you are interested in partnering with UT on research that may benefit your business or industry. . It dates back to 1862, when the university became a land-grant institution and established itself in agricultural research. Today the university supports academic investigation of almost every aspect of human life. ) The links on this page will lead you to information about what UT researchers are working on, what research results have been achieved, and how findings may be applied.</td>

 . (The acronym stands for Achievement Rewards for College Scientists. ) Sean's research efforts are focused on the role of geometric phases in sensing and control and mobile robotics. Fifteen ISR faculty members participated in the NASA Goddard and University of Maryland Technical Summit, held in the AV Williams building on April 23. Participants included ISR Assistant Research Scientist Eric Justh (above), who spoke on high-resolution optical wave-front sensing and control.</td>
