<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" Both dark adaptation (red illumination) and the use of a calcium chloride- and magnesium chloride-free solution (at room temperature) can facilitate retinal detachment in macular translocation surgery. Both techniques are proposed as a gentle support for the operation, because they protect an intact RPE cell layer and do not cause retinal damage at the ultrastructural level. ABSTRACT The ability of retinal Mueller glial cells to perform phagocytosis in vivo is studied in a rabbit model of experimental retinal detachment where pigment epithelial cells are occasionally detached together with the neural retina. The granules are virtually intact at the ultrastructural level, and are surrounded by a membrane. They are often located close to the sclerad end of the cells, but some are distributed throughout the outer stem process up to the soma.">
