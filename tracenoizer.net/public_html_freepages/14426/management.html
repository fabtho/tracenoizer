 The study supports previous research on the relationship between government funding and nonprofit characteristics, with one notable exception-less administrative complexity was associated with higher percentages of government funding. The size of the nonprofit sector has increased rapidly over the past 60 years from a little more than 12,000 organizations in 1940 to over 1. While the sector has grown quickly, serious questions have arisen in recent years about the funding and management of these organizations, particularly the public-serving nonprofits whose supporters are entitled to a tax deduction for their contributions. In response to contributors' concerns following a series of highly publicized financial scandals at nationally prominent charities, the field of nonprofit management has quietly undergone a period of self-examination aimed at bringing greater financial controls and tighter operations to the sector (Bryson 1995; Kearns 1996; Letts, Ryan, and Grossman 1999; Pappas 1995). 1 Reforms in the way nonprofit organizations operate have been aimed at reassuring the public that contributions are being wisely applied to the core charitable missions of these organizations.</td>
