 UAL management will no longer be distracted by Avolar, and so should be able to focus on United's issues. UAL and United Airlines have some significant problems--labor dissatisfaction and high costs, especially--to resolve before we will be confident that the company will emerge from the current industry downturn.

 REVIEWED BY BILL HARDING Hannibal The Gift Proof of Life The Watcher Meet The Parents Way of the Gun The sixth day Unbreakable Bedazzled Space Cowboys Wonder Boys Gladiator Stigmata Circus Double Jeopardy Toy Story 2 The Beach Chicken Run Frequency Deception The Next Best Thing Shanghi Noon Cherry Falls American Beauty Snatch Blair Witch 2 Skulls Shaft 'You talkin' to me. ' Robert De Niro was great - make that the greatest - in the mid-seventies to the early nineties, when beautifully written, disturbing and moving roles like Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver, Jake La Motta in Raging Bull and James Conway kicked his career into the critical if not the box office stratosphere. Nobody knew it then, but writing like that was going out of style faster than you could say Paul Schrader. It's not the fault of actors there's so little great movie writing to grab and shake life into. Martin Scorsese and Schrader have worked successfully since, but nothing they have done since 1975 can hold a lighted candle to Taxi Driver.</td>
