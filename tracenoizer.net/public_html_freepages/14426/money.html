 . But it was one of the biggest hits they had that year. But the reason they get the big money is they're unique as talents and people want to go see them. They're not gonna want to go see them in every movie, because the movie's gotta be good too, but hopefully they can get it to open.

 The track, with stadium seating on three sides, is said to be the drag-racing equivalent of the California Speedway, a gem by which all facilities new and old will be judged. With its proximity to Chicago and its modern amenities, Route 66 is exactly what the NHRA needed, Prudhomme said. When the fans are spending that kind of money to go to a drag race or a NASCAR race, they want a nice place to sit, a family-oriented facility. The meet conflicts with the Championship Auto Racing Teams Miller Lite 200 at the Milwaukee Mile. There might not be much overlap in the races' potential crowds, but there will be a few people who'd like to be in both places.</td>
