 When Roger Ebert becomes a brand name by reducing his reviews to a simple thumbs up or thumbs down, that's the plainspeak of Kael. When Warren Beatty won an Oscar last year for lifetime achievement, that also could be traced to Kael. Although she had an encyclopedic knowledge of film history, Kael brought movie criticism into everyday discourse by ridding it of academic pretense. She railed against the kind of highbrow, Eurocentric criticism that was embodied by the late Bosley Crowther of The New York Times. In the 1950s, she operated a repertory cinema in Berkeley, Calif.</td>

 This with the other material inventions, as well as the lessons learnt from the first Industrial Revolution, arrived just in time to be taken maximum advantage of by the still small but recently independent American population. The influx to North America of skilled and unskilled labour in the decades following the Napoleonic wars provided a workforce (and a ready market) for opening up the continent west of the Appalachians, which vast area was a veritable economic vacuum. This westward expansion is vividly (though more than a little crudely) illustrated on John Gast's allegorical painting "American Progress", used for the cover of DOES TECHNOLOGY DRIVE HISTORY. Indeed the "Toynbeean Challenge" was optimal, and in retrospect it is not surprising that rapid development occurred in such measure that any thoughts of Malthus's earlier misgivings were simply blown away in the euphoria of unfettered economic growth. Would it be correct to say that this 19th century experience provides the foundation for latter-day conventional economic philosophy.</td>

 It proves that there is still a small place in Hollywood for movies with a brain. said to be considering politics, even though he's signed for Terminator 3. Big Arnie made his name blasting his adversaries with the heaviest weapons and firepower in the history of the cinema. He tried comedy in Twins and Kindergarten Cop, and it didn't work. Now he seems to have turned his back on the guns and is said to be considering politics, even though he's signed for Terminator 3.</td>
