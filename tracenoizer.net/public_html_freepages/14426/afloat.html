Keeping Avolar afloat would have required additional cash from UAL at a time when its most important subsidiary, United Airlines, is struggling mightily. UAL management will no longer be distracted by Avolar, and so should be able to focus on United's issues. UAL and United Airlines have some significant problems--labor dissatisfaction and high costs, especially--to resolve before we will be confident that the company will emerge from the current industry downturn.</td>

PSINet has said it can't guarantee that any of its efforts will keep the company afloat and that it's stock may soon be worthless. Speculation has also been rife that PSINet may soon file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. .</td>
