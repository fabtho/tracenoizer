 In 1950, over 7000 worked here, but the Army intended to leave by April, 1951. In 1955, BMW restarted Allach as BMW Triebwerkbau building GE turbines for F-104 Starfighter aircraft but Managing BMW Director Richter-Brohm sold, that year, half the business to MAN who built vehicles there. In 1965 BMW sold the rest of its shares in Power Plant Production Co. Ltd (Triebwerkbau GmbH) to MAN AG which renamed the firm MAN Turbo GmbH which was merged with MAN Turbomotoren GmbH. MAN had facilities in Berlin-Spandau, which built Rolls Royce Tyne engines under liscense, and in Friedrichshafen.</td>

 I particularly like Eve and her serpent, but the golden calf is a wowser, too, and a snazzier creation myth is unlikely to be seen outside the Sistine Chapel. I wouldn't have thought we needed yet another version of The Miracle Worker, not after Patty Duke as Helen Keller and Anne Bancroft as Annie Sullivan in the 1962 film version of the play, and especially not after Patty Duke as Annie Sullivan and Melissa Gilbert as Helen Keller in the surprisingly interesting 1979 TV-movie remake. No matter how tired you may have become of Hallie Kate Eisenberg in those Pepsi commercials, she is a superb young Helen in this Disney production, and Alison Elliott as Annie is just as good here as she was in The Spitfire Grill and The Wings of the Dove, which means splendid. Even David Strathairn, whose choice of roles continues to perplex, is persuasive as Helen's southern gent of a father, although we could have done without the happy darkies on his 1887 tobacco plantation. About all that's missing from Napoleon, David Grubin's four-hour "documentary film chronicle" for public television, is a talking head as excitable and expansive as the Little Corporal himself.</td>

 Philadelphia Macaroni recently secured a contract to supply pasta to Quaker Oats, which will cause the plant to expand by over 50 percent and add at least 10 employees. And the state-owned mill will provide the plant with durum wheat. Noodles by Leonardo opened its Devils Lake plant this spring and hopes to employ 125 people when it is in full production by January 1993. In response to concerns that Dakota Growers might be one too many noodle in the pot, Dalrymple says, "That just shows you can do business in North Dakota and that people are looking for increased production. "It's been an unfortunate history of the whole state," Dalrymple says.</td>
