 Gradually, a fictional character comes into being, a woman sitting behind her computer somewhere in Western Europe. Edit Kaldor does not only offer an exciting reflection on the nature of the relationship between human beings and their computers, on a further level she manages to convince us in Or Press Escape that a desktop can be turned into an eventful stage. She studied literature and drama at Columbia University (New York) and at DasArts (The Amsterdam School for Research in Theatre and Dance). She presently lives and works in Amsterdam and Brussels, making theatre performances that often integrate various forms of digital media. Ze studeerde literatuur en theater aan Columbia University (New York) en in DasArts (The Amsterdam School for Research in Theatre and Dance).</td>

 . Le lettere compaiono sul monitor una a una, sbocciate da singoli gesti che nascondono frammenti di pensiero e decisioni e indecisioni minimali; azioni che svelano un ritmo interiore, e inalano di vita questa storia. Ungherese di nascita, Edit Kaldor ha studiato letteratura e arte drammatica alla Columbia University di New York e al DasArts di Amsterdam. Ha alle spalle una lunga collaborazione newyorkese con Peter Halasz (Squat - Love Theatre); insieme realizzano oltre trenta performance in Europa e negli Stati Uniti. Vive attualmente ad Amsterdam, dove realizza spettacoli in cui i linguaggi tradizionali sono contaminati dai nuovi media digitali.</td>

 The large conifer by the greenhouse is an eight-year-old seedling of Cupressus arizonica from seed collected at a natural stand in Arizona. Antal is an instructor at the school and Laszlo is a lecturer. It is a school with such a good reputation that the best graduating student may go on to the university without taking an entrance exam. A small pinetum of dwarf conifers is under development by Antal and Laszlo with the aid of student workers. Financial constraints have hindered its development, but progress is being made.</td>
