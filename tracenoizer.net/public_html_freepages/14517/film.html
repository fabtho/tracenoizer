 A memorable score enhances the sensual texture of this beautifully filmed work as Hilbert slowly, painfully, but definitively comes into his own. .50 EXPL09R Sponsored by In this exploration of identity, a young man ditches the real world for that of film, only to realize that running away is a substitute for the sublimity of everyday life. When his father has a near-fatal heart attack, Hilbert falls into a downward spiral of introspection and re-evaluation, turning away from his family and girlfriend toward the comfort of an alternative world. A memorable score enhances the sensual texture of this beautifully filmed work as Hilbert slowly, painfully, but definitively comes into his own.</td>

 His work is an exploration of the narrative systems of books, films, photographs and network media, re-considering and re-presenting such systems as procedural machines of authoring and reading. From feature and experimental films to digital art, he explores how discourse constructs itself. His early films, 'auto-re-tour' and 'fini-la guerre', investigate the tensions between narrativity and the pure surface of film. As the machines of discourse move between signification systems and systems of rhythm, sound and image, they begin to oscillate between operations of chance and discrete narrativity, between signification and the slippage of signification. Yet these operations of play and slippage remain bound by the medium and its constraints and limits.</td>
