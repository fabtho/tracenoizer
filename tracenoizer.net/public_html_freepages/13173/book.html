 Not much sleep; every time I moved I had a new spot to warm up. Slept in long johns, T-shirt and Hooded Sweatshirt. Got out my Jimmy Buffett book and read until my fingers got too cold to hold the book open, about two short chapters. Cleaned up the Fire Pit and most of the camping area. found a bucket with a broken bottom down by the river that we placed the trash in.</td>
