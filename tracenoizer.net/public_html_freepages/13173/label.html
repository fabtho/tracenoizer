<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" For "Panatone," the resident Groove Merchant's run is a steaming bath of lusty down- and mid-tempo grooves to help ease the tension of 21st century living, and we're all invited to light a candle, kick back and soak for hours in his bubbly tub of dreamy jazz. But Paul Martin and Alex Attias refuse to be trapped by the Broken Beat sound they've helped cultivate. While the influence of the West London music scene can be heard throughout "Life Mirrors," it's nearly impossible to label to this eclectic collage of abstract beats. But whether we call it Broken Beat or Future Jazz, Latin or Dub, Beatless have injected their latest work with more feel-good soul than many of their "label-ready" electronic contemporaries. And while on one hand we claim to despise what Castro's Cuba has come to stand for, we also seem to have developed a taste for any shred of Cuban culture that manages to escape from the small island.">

 Knox (guitar, bass, vocals) and Ovendon (drums, vocals) later joined The 69ers as full-time members. Knox had been a member of Original Battersea Heroes. Led by Terry Darmody, the Heroes had issued an album, Little Miss Lucy and Boogie Chicken, at the same time as The 69ers Album on Du Monde's sister label Violet's Holiday (although Knox did not appear on it). The 69ers' line-up of Butler, Bethall, Knox and Ovendon played a riotous set at the second annual Sunbury festival (January 1973). April 1973 was a busy time for the band, because that month Bethall, Knox and Ovendon sacked Butler from his own band.</td>
