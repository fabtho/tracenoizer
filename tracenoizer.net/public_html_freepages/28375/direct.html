<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" So to get the movie picture you see on television, the colour television camera has to scan 625 lines in every image, 25 times a second. It takes the camera just 64 millionths of a second to scan across each line in a single picture. The television camera encodes the three separate colour signals into one signal, which is sent from the camera either to video recorder or direct to the station's transmitter. This sends out a radio signal to be picked up by your television antenna. The TV set then converts that radio signal back to the original red, blue and green colour signals (and of course the associated sound).">

 The codeword was the lasting legacy of the Rice machine; it became the basis for capability-based protection, which appeared in Iliffe's Basic Language Machine. The segmentation that codewords allowed was a major factor in the development of the CTS system, one of the earliest multiprogramming environments. While the R1 did not have much direct evolutionary influence on the history of computer design, its large register set (for the time), its indirect addressing capability, and its use of codewords all had significant influence on subsequent generations of computers. Memory was initially implemented in CRT storage tubes, which could each store 8192 bits. Thus each tube represented a one-bit wide slice of the total memory.</td>
