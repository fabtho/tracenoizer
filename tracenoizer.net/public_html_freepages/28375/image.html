 Television pictures are generated electronically and are transmitted to our home by a radio signal. The colour television camera begins the process of creating a picture on your television screen. The camera lens focuses the image onto television pick-up devices, which convert light energy (the picture), into electrical signals, the television signal. The colour television camera has three pick-up devices - one for each of the primary colours - red, blue and green. Television pictures are like movie pictures, in that whilst our eye sees a continual moving image, they are really thousands of sequential still images.</td>

 The R1 was designed with a line printer capable of 300 lines per minute. The printer used a six-bit character code and printed 108 characters per line. A print image was constructed by arranging 18 words per half-line in a continuous memory block and then issuing a "print left" or a "print right" instruction. The tape system of the R1 never functioned very reliably. While 4 tape drives were provided for, no more than two were generally working at any one time.</td>
