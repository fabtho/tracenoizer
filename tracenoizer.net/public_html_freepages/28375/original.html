 The television camera encodes the three separate colour signals into one signal, which is sent from the camera either to video recorder or direct to the station's transmitter. This sends out a radio signal to be picked up by your television antenna. The TV set then converts that radio signal back to the original red, blue and green colour signals (and of course the associated sound). Under the control of the Director of News, Journalists and Camera Crews cover stories throughout the day. The Director of News controls the activities of every member of the station's news department.</td>

 Examination of the tube with the diagnostic leads revealed that the bit pattern had shrunk significantly from its proper size. In 1967, 16K of Ampex core (1 microsecond cycle, 400 ns access) was added, bringing the machine to its full capacity of 32K words. Shortly thereafter, the original electrostatic memory was decommissioned, as it had become extremely error-prone due to its age. The character code was six bits, with the seventh reserved for control functions such as delete. The console typewriter could be used to enter a word directly into the instruction or S registers, and to display the contents of any fast register.</td>
