 Output could be routed to a line printer, a paper tape punch, or the console typewriter. Additional devices were added by and for various users throughout the machine's lifespan. Circuitry The nucleus technology for the computer consisted of vacuum tube triodes, although almost all circuitry added to the machine after 1963 or so was emitter-coupled (ECL) transistor-based logic. Graham had solved the problem at Los Alamos National Labs by realizing that the signals were pulses, and thus amenable to AC techniques. Hence, a 15-to-1 winding on a pulse transformer would translate output to input levels, and give a floating voltage differential with no grounding problems.</td>
