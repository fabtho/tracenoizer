 It is this precise habitat in which you will discover a hunt that is not just a quick shoot, but a true sporting challenge of which memories of a lifetime are made. . Together, we offer 2,560 acres of traditional farm and ranch land in South Central South Dakota - undisputedly the best pheasant hunting region in the United States. Our operation is a continuing work in progress, and over many years, we have carefully developed the optimal habitat to attract and provide exceptional pheasant population. It is this precise habitat in which you will discover a hunt that is not just a quick shoot, but a true sporting challenge of which memories of a lifetime are made.</td>
