Charles Johnson's Spiritual Imagination, by Jonathan Little Charles Johnson's Spiritual Imagination Jonathan Little In this first book-length study of Charles Johnson's work, Jonathan Little offers an engaging account of the artistic growth of one of the most important contemporary African American writers. From his beginnings as a political cartoonist through his receipt of the National Book Award for Middle Passage, Johnson's imagination has become increasingly spiritual. Charles Johnson's Spiritual Imagination begins with an analysis of Johnson's political cartoons from the late sixties and early seventies, when he was immersed in the Black Power Movement.</td>

 The characterizations in 'Oxherding Tale' are its strongest virtue. The novel's language, though, is deliberately ornate and tangled. Charles Johnson's literary and scholarly allusions can be interesting, but more often than not his prose smothers the characters rather than bringing them to life. " "Middle Passage" Reviewed by Thomas Keneally (1990) "There are problems with Charles Johnson's third novel that might seem to call forth from a reviewer the old cheap-shot treatment. But the genre switches of 'Middle Passage,' from period bodice-ripper to metaphysical drama, are - like every other aspect of this fairly short book - heroic in proportion.</td>
