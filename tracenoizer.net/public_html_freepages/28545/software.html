 Please check the key fingerprint before using this. . I'm a 22-year old computer science student, software designer and free software enthusiast from Espoo, Finland. I'm studying my third year as a CS major in the University of Helsinki. As a person, I am deeply artistic, but I'm also scientific and exact at times - one might say I'm an eccentric combination of a humanist and a scientist.</td>
