 Thoni for production of the mammography measurements; David Nicewander for work on the diabetes measurements; and Kelly Westfall and Pam Wolfe, MA, MS, for creating Figure 1. . Data were collected using medical record abstraction for inpatient care, analysis of Medicare claims for some ambulatory services, and surveys for immunization rates. Separate samples were drawn for each topic for each state. Some states (particularly less populous states and those in the Northeast) consistently ranked high in relative performance while others (particularly more populous states and those in the Southeast) consistently ranked low.</td>
