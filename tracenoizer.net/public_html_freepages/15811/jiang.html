<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" net - Two Australian members of the meditation sect, Falungong, have been released from jail in southern China. An American follower of the group has also been released and deported. The two Sydney women, Jiang Hui Jie and Jiang Xi Li, were arrested with two other practitioners on the outskirts of Guangzhou on Thursday. They'd arrived in China two weeks ago to lend support to Falungong followers - the 100-million strong spiritual movement which China banned in July, calling it an evil cult. An American practitioner arrested with the Australian women was released and deported on Friday.">
