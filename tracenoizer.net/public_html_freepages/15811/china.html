 We only have some old vedioes to be borrowed at the moment. It is an exciting time for all nations in our region. This is particularly so in Australia where we have directed much of our attention in the last fifteen years to building on our substantial relationship with the People's Republic of China. The potential opportunities arising from the return of Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty are enormous. For China, the change will boost their commercial footing in the South East Asia region, while opportunities for Australian businesses in Hong Kong and on mainland China can only improve.</td>

Christmas has been co-opted by the Communists as good for stimulating business and is already a bigger deal than New Year's Eve in China's cities. Thousands of vaguely Asiatic Santa statues stand guard across China in November through December. And millions of paper Santa-head cutouts adorn shop windows, his face beet red, in China's traditional celebratory color.</td>
