 .Microsoft TypographyKris Holmes and Charles BigelowThe Wingdings fonts were designed by Kris Holmes and Charles Bigelow in 1990 and 1991. The fonts were originally named Lucida Icons, Arrows, and Stars to complement the Lucida text font family by the same designers. Renamed, reorganized, and released in 1992 as Microsoft Wingdings(TM), the three fonts provide a harmoniously designed set of icons representing the common components of personal computer systems and the elements of graphical user interfaces. Pointing and indicating are frequent functions in graphical interfaces, so in adition to a wide selection of pointing hands, the Wingdings fonts also offer arrows in careful gradations of weight and different directions and styles.</td>

 I wanted to got to Phanom Rung, but for the life of me couldn't remember the name of the place. But she seemed a bit confused about the Bt 20 tip I offered her. At the entrance I was behind a Thai family group who seemed quite curious about me. As the Thai family, especially grandfather, howled with laughter the woman agreed enthusiastically and offered me a refund of Bt 30. Grandfather could contain himself no longer and walked close and stared up at me from his bent posture.</td>
