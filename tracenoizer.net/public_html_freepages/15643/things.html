 " The excitement and vitality of adolescence during the cultural revolution is the theme of "In the Heat of the Sun," a Chinese film shown at the 1994 Venice film festival. The film's director, Jiang Wen, said he believes it is misleading to talk about this period as being either completely good or bad. "If you look at documentaries about that time you feel that whips were being used to get people to do things they did," Jiang said. "People really wanted to do things, they (had) energy and an excitement, a fervor. '" But even today, decades after the last "Long live Chairman Mao" slogans were shouted in the capital and elsewhere in China, public critique of the cultural revolution is still discouraged and sales of related memorabilia are allowed.</td>

 pronouns (or other ways of referrring) in conversations. Before, I was thinking about Direction (1) in working on my data from 5 year old children's talk in play. But now it seems that several things may be happening and I may have to tease out the different types of uses of names. When children's attention is not there, then names can be used as an attention getter, which is similar to (3) (though this is second person reference). If children use names as an expression of frustration, anger, or excitement, then it is (1).</td>

 Another place is Khao Sarn Center - again on the left but much closer to the police station as you walk towards it. One of my favorite hobbies was to go to a leading hotel to eat. Problem is they measured things by local standards. Flash fried rice and chicken gets rid of any bacteria that might have been in there, a few spring onions garnish this treat. You put the chili on after this is cooked so it's a safe bet.</td>
