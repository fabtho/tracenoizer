 This reunion with her former owner was not going entirely in a manner that she would have liked, not least for the fact that all of her closest friends were currently in deep distress as was--not coincidentally--her father. She had a fairly good idea of what was going on around her. She knew Madam Lao and her ways, knew her policy regarding outsider women who wound up on board her vessel, and knew that Lao would set about methodically breaking down their resistance so that they might better fit in with the women who constituted the crew on board the Piece Of Junk. Some would be conditioned to be slaves, a few might be recruited as potential crewmates, while anyone resisting this program would be treated to a very harsh ordeal that would either turn them into passive- submissives or would break them all together, most likely the latter. The men would not have much to worry about, at first, as Lao had her own agenda concerning the male of the species, and some men might even enjoy it.</td>
