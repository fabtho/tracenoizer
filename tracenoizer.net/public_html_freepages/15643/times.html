 But Paganism is growing rapidly and estimates range from 100,000 to over 2 million Pagans, Pantheists, and Wiccans in North America. It is possible that Wicca alone is the fourth largest religion in America, behind Christianity, Islam, and Judaism. Discrimination has kept many of us in the "broom closet" but times are changing. And calendars are one way to make us visible without putting any individual in danger. Also I petition for fellow Pagans, Wiccans and Pantheists to get in touch with calendar companies and mention our request.</td>

 Thank you for creating such a warm and friendly environment for us to spend our honeymoon. Every detail of your house truly proves that you care. Thank you and Mahalo many times over for making our vacation an experience we will never forget. "Edlyn Lao, San Francisco CA "Your Cherished Seacoast is beautiful. Sitting on the front lanai in one of the comfy chairs, sipping champagne, looking out towards the ocean is simply paradise.</td>

 Yes, it is the same Khao San Road you saw in 'The Beach', but leave your preconceptions at home; Khao San Road is almost certainly nothing like what you imagine it to be. Not surprisingly it has become known as a halfway house between the East and West, and, as Alex Garland calls it, a 'decompression chamber for all those about to leave Thailand'. As such it's commercial, at times too businesslike, but generally a very cool place to be. Most importantly for you, it's a place where you can get your head together before you start your travels in earnest. Getting to Khao San Road There are a number of ways to get to Khao San road from Don Muang Airport (the airport you will fly in to).</td>
