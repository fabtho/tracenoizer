 She earned her undergraduate degree in Chinese Folk Dance at the Chinese Cultural College of Taipei. Eight years as Coordinator of Cultural Programming for the Taiwan Television Corporation has provided Angela extensive experience in arts management, which she brings to the troupe. In partnership with her husband, DANNY CHANG, ANGELA's education, training and talent have been instrumental in making the Chinese Golden Dragon Acrobats the leading troupe of Chinese acrobats in the world today. Children hoping to become acrobats begin their training as young as four or five years old. Specific training with an acrobat troupe may begin by the age of eight.</td>
