<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" Unix CGILua needs to be installed in a directory which is identified in the server as being a directory with permission to execute CGI scripts. This identification varies a lot from server to server. If CGILua is to be used by more than one user (multi-user installation), it is advisable to activate the tool's capacity to "change user" according to the owner of the script being run. This is one of the security mechanisms offered by CGILua, and we recommend using it in environments where it is desirable to alter the privileges of script execution according to the user who has written it. To activate this mechanism it is necessary that the owner of the executable file cgilua is the root user, and also that the executable has permission to "set userid".">

 On the other hand, as explained above, browser support to iframe is limited, more limited than for normal frames. On the other hand, normal frames are usually resizable by the user, though the author might manage to prevent this (using the noresize attribute). a table is, except in the sense that if the width or height is specified as a percentage, the actual width or height may change when the entire window is resized. For information about normal frames, see section on frames in Mikodocs Guide to HTML (excellent tutorial, which discusses advanced issues too) Guide to frames usage by Galactus (excellent discussion, but partly dated) section Frames in the HTML 4. 01 Specification (official reference) section on frames in the Web Authoring FAQ (answers the most common questions about frames).</td>
