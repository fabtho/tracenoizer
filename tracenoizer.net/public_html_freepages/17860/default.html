 WebTV Plus has iframe support, but the "small bugs" include failure to comply with the fundamental idea of using the content of the element only if the inline frame itself is not displayed. As the link text, it uses the name attribute if present, otherwise the URL (the src attribute value). 0 beta supports iframe, with the option to turn the support off (as independently of normal frame support), and the default setting seems to be to have the support disabled. Browsers which do not support iframe are expected to ignore the start and end tags of the element and render its content instead. This is a special case of the general idea of ignoring unknown tags.</td>

 CGILua is readily extendable, accepting additional libraries, which means that additional resources can easily be made available. Many extensions for CGILua have already been developed, such as libraries to control occurences in file writes, communication with data bases, and communication cryptography. Some of them are included in the default distribution and are described in section Libraries. CGILua automatically decodes data from forms or passed as parameters, which simplifies the manipulation of URL and FORM information. Scripts do not need to be altered to enable migration between sites.</td>
