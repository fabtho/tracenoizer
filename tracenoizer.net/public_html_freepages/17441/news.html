 And one problem you'll find with this page is that Joni was so solid throughout the 70's that we've rated album after album as really good (4 stars) to downright brilliant (5 stars). Her 80's records were victims of the era's kitschy hi-tech production values, and we're split on her most recent albums, with Wilson thinking she's fully recaptured her glory years but me arguing that she's lost her voice and poetic spark. There's a marvelous Joni Mitchell site with complete discography, interviews, news, and even some of her paintings. (JA) There's also another Joni Mitchell page with a minimal bio and a discography with links to lyrics pages and some soundbytes. (DBW) Joni Mitchell is one of rock music's premiere songwriters.</td>
