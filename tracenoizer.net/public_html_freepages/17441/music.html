<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" Her voice is flexible, genuine and gripping, and she's an occasionally arresting, always solid acoustic guitar player. She's never reached major commercial success but maintains enough of a core following to keep making records her way. There's no extensive fan site I'm aware of, but Harmony Ridge Music has put together a servicable page with a full discography and tidbits of other information. The best songs (the caustic put-down "Child Star," the post-affair "It Could Have Been Better") are as striking and memorable as anything she's done since, but those gems are scattered in a set of confessional songs so understated they don't leave an impression ("Gave It A Try," title track). Most of the tunes were written by Armatrading and fellow Caribbean-to-England transplant Pat Nestor, the last time Armatrading would use a co-writer to any significant extent.">
