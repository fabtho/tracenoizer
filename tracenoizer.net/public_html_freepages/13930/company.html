 According to someone familiar with its strategy, GM is negotiating to meet the mandate by buying regulatory credits from one of several start-up NEV makers. A likely candidate, this person says, is Lido Motor Co. , company whose founder is none other than Lee Iacocca, the former Chrysler Corp. NEVs can be recharged overnight with a traditional three-pronged, 110-volt outlet. A charge uses only about half the electricity that a refrigerator uses in a day -hardly enough, proponents say, to constitute an undue burden on California's straining utilities.</td>

 I look forward to new music in the future to play on my fishing cruiser "Southern Cross" on Lake Michigan. I'm currently working my ass off on a compilation of Tennessee artists for the Freedom Engine fund to buy FDNY a new fire truck. I've recently signed a development deal with Van Morrison's production company. With my band "donner-salverius-band", wich is locatet on the island of Norderney in the german Northsea, played your songs about 25 years. I've been a Stephen fan for years and I just found this site.</td>
