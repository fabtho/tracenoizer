 Departments will continue to surplus laptops and non Intel based systems when appropriate. . This process, based on the Computer Workstation Acquisition and Upgrade Plan, enables participating departments to increase their purchasing power for computers by pooling funds with other departments to allow mass purchases of computers by the Microcomputer Maintenance Shop. Examples of classes of computers, their use, and their acquisition cost are shown in Table I. The class of a computer is based on the applications that a faculty or staff member intends to use.</td>
