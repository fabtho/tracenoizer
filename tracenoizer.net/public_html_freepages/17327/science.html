 And as we read these greatest spiritual compositions in all the world, they enrich our spiritual sense, and they exalt our symbols, and then we're enabled to use those symbols ourselves on a truly spiritual and scientific basis. Eddy's textbook crystallizes the system which is embodied in the Bible; it shows us how it operates and how to use it. Of course, the Christian Science textbook introduces Scriptural terminology time and time again, and although it is not always citing Scriptural incidents specifically, it is permeated with the tone of those incidents. I feel that the study of the Bible has given us what it gave Mrs. If we study the Christian Science textbook without the Bible, our sense of Science will not be complete.</td>
