 General questions regarding this page should be directed to Gary Bell via Internet e-mail. . To enable tracking the status of on-going research projects, summaries are provided here and will be updated quarterly. The project summaries are being added as they become available and most are expected in the near future. It's planned that at some point the summaries will be searchable.</td>
