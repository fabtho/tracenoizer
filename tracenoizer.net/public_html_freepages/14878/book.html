 One of the few breaks in the 200-year-long Anglo-American judicial practice of censoring literature and art took place in 1959 - two years after the Supreme Court's landmark decision in Roth v. United States - when federal Judge Clayton Horn stopped San Francisco policemen from destroying all copies of Allen's poem Howl. In the process, Judge Horn also freed Howl publisher Lawrence Ferlinghetti from criminal charges of selling an obscene book at his City Lights Books. At the time, Allen was in Tangier with Jack Kerouac, helping Bill Burroughs put Naked Lunch into publishable shape. They addressed the literary merit of Ginsberg's work and, even more significantly, the poem's social importance.</td>
