<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" The art of the Baroque is an art of excess, of encrusted, overloaded palace ceilings. Barney takes this overripe palatial aesthetic and makes it into an art for the 21st century. The cremaster is the muscle in the male genitals from which the testicles are suspended (and which retracts them in cold or fear). Barney's 'Cremaster' is a massively ambitious project centred on five films, of which four have been shown to date - Cremaster 4 in 1994, Cremaster 1 in 1995-96, Cremaster 5 in 1997 and Cremaster 2 in 1999. The entire series is to be exhibited at the Guggenheim, New York, in 2001.">

 Francois Ozon's Collected Shorts The Confusion of Genders (La Confusion des Genres) For our Mums and Dads. . The final episode, Cremaster 5 takes place at the opera house and the thermal baths of Budapest. In Barney's eccentrically erotic universe, nothing is construed as simply one thing or the other.

Barney lives in New York and is currently at work on Cremaster 5, the third installment of his video cycle to be produced.</td>
