 This program is generously supported by Contemporary Extension, an auxiliary of SFMOMA. . Since 1994, Barney has completed three sections of the series-in-progress, beginning with Cremaster 4 (1994) and Cremaster 1 (1995), which will be the fourth and first films in the completed cycle. The Spring Film Program features the latest installment of his epic project, Cremaster 5, which will be the final film in the completed series. Through a montage of imagery and symbolically related events, Barney constructs a sinuous and erotic form of cinema.</td>
