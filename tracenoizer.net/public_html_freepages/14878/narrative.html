 Matthew Barney Matthew Barney Born 1967, San Francisco, California, U. Lives and works in New York Cremaster 2 is part of a five-film series that has occupied Barney as writer, director, and actor since 1994. Although not one continuous narrative, the series revolves around issues of masculine prowess and transcendence. In each of the films, ritualized athletic endeavors and sexual transformations are emphasized. Episodes in the film present Harry Houdini (played by Mailer), reputed by family legend to be the illegitimate grandfather of Gilmore, as a perfect athlete capable of transcending physical limitations and escaping from any space.</td>

 The cycle circulates around anatomical conditions of "ascension" or "descension" to metaphorically describe the evolution of form through biological, psychosexual, and morphological allusions. According to Curator Nancy Spector, "With the CREMASTER cycle, Barney is transcribing a new, post-Oedipal myth for our contemporary culture. His is a counter-narrative that depicts internal conflict rather than external mastery; it is an epic saga in which definition is defied and resolution deferred. " Spector continued, "In contrast to the tragedy of Oedipus Rex, paternal law need not be overcome because it simply does not exist. Instead, form engenders form through a radical cycle of discipline, self-division, and resistance.</td>
