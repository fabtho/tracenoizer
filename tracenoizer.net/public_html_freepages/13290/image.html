 . To achieve this in Photoshop you need to construct a mask for the Gausian Blur filter. This mask should hide the bright parts of the image, while exposing the grainy parts to the blur filter. I have created an action which includes all of these steps which you can download. To use it just open up the Actions window, click on the arrow in the upper right of the window and select Load actions.</td>

 An enjoyable way to accomplish this goal is by watching a documentary. Documentary art videos let you hear the artist's words, view their creativity and experience their creative environment. This documentary, produced by Image Entertainment, covers Pollock's life and art through historical film and interviews. Good background resource for those who enjoyed the film, Pollock. Observe the artist at work, re-creating monumental portraits from photos, segment by segment.</td>

 . farocki fragments ii Harun Farocki fragments ii INSCRIPTION, SUBJECTIVITY, ESSAY FORM 1. Farocki introduces an image juxtaposition between this time-place and that of the boulevard. The woman is transported through his imagination and commentary to a boulevard,where she is the recipient of a male gaze, and where she turns her head slightly toward the direction it comes from. The grotesqueness of this photo is brought to the fore by this fantasy, this small reflection on gender, the gaze, and the click of the shutter.</td>
