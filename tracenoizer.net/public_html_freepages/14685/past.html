 "It is a real reflection of RMIT University's goal to produce graduates with a real-world understanding of their areas and the ability to apply problem solving to a competition such as this. It is great for all the students from both universities to be involved in this junior think tank that will benefit not only the students but external parties as well in the future. " "Staff at RMIT University's Career Development and Employment unit and the University of Melbourne's Careers and Employer Liaison Unit must also be thanked for their tireless efforts over the past six weeks to ensure the success of the event," Ms Tyler said. by Paul WhiteRMIT is a member of the Australian Technology Network . .</td>

 I devoted two days to reading MS Bodley 672 (the unique text of Lucian's De laude Cestrie) in Duke Humfrey's Library at Oxford's Bodleian Library. I spent much of my time in England in the new British Library, researching early modern romance and Stanley family manuscripts. I didn't get a chance this past summer to search the Cheshire documents at the Public Record Office, but I plan to do so the next time I make it over to the UK. I also want to visit the Institute of Historical Research. .</td>
