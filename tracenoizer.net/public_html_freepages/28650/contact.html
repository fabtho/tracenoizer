 7 (481k) Windows Windows users please make sure you read the README. Some CD-ROM drives need to have their Drivers updated to read CD-PLUS Enhanced CDs. If your PC has trouble reading the CD contact your manufacturer and tell them your PC is having trouble reading "Multisession CD-PLUS Enhanced CDs". Many CD-ROM drives that come with PCs, even brand new PCs do not support Multisession CDs and will need to be upgraded. If your PC sees the music portion of the CD, but not the CD-ROM portion, then most likely your drive does not support Multisession.</td>
