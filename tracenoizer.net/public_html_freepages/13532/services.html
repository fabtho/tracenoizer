 Colorado's Southwest Regional Library Service System The Southwest Regional Library Service System (SWRLSS - pronounced "swirls") is one of seven legislatively-created regional library systems in Colorado. SWRLSS works for, with and through its member libraries. Its mission is to strengthen, support and equalize member library services by providing and enhancing leadership, providing services and access to resources, and encouraging cooperation among libraries in order to improve public access to information. Other libraries in those same counties may be associate members. Each full member agency is entitled to a representative on the Membership Council.</td>
