 The mission of the SRC is to conduct and report teacher-directed classroom-based inquiry that informs practice and enlightens theory for literacy professionals. Initiated in the fall of 1992, the SRC is a grass-roots, self-governed teacher research community. One of the distinguishing and critical features of the SRC is that the research questions that drive current and future studies have come directly from the teacher-researchers themselves, as opposed to questions that might emanate from university researchers or their larger NRRC research agenda. This paper describes the evolution of the research questions that guide SRC studies. The first sets of research questions came from open-ended meetings with prospective SRC teacher researchers.</td>

 What plans, if any, does YSU have already about setting up a distance learning program. . Formulating Research Questions Formulating Research Questions For a problem-solution paper, I have to start by stating the problem and then thinking about how to solve it. Based on what I've read so far, the problem seems to be that distance learning is basically a good thing but it can make education less personal and more passive. So my central question is how can YSU set up a distance learning program that works well.</td>
