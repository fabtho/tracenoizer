 Scientists do not know why these cells alone have this ability. Because they can form any cell type of the human body, these human stem cells hold great promise for several medical therapies and scientific purposes. They are able to replicate themselves while remaining in an immature, or "undifferentiated" state, thus offering a potentially unlimited source of cells for organ transplantation, as well as provide a model system for drug discovery and the study of human development. While IVF-derived stem cell research is at a very early stage, it appears to offer great promise to quicken the pace of discovery for a cure for diabetes. JDRF encourages the pursuit of this line of research within the framework of appropriate scientific and ethical safeguards established by representatives of the public.</td>
