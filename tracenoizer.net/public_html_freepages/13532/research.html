 . The mission of the SRC is to conduct and report teacher-directed classroom-based inquiry that informs practice and enlightens theory for literacy professionals. Initiated in the fall of 1992, the SRC is a grass-roots, self-governed teacher research community. One of the distinguishing and critical features of the SRC is that the research questions that drive current and future studies have come directly from the teacher-researchers themselves, as opposed to questions that might emanate from university researchers or their larger NRRC research agenda. This paper describes the evolution of the research questions that guide SRC studies.</td>

Human IVF-derived stem cells have the unique capacity to become any type of cell, tissue or organ as they mature and develop, yet they cannot themselves develop into a full human being. Scientists do not know why these cells alone have this ability.</td>

 What plans, if any, does YSU have already about setting up a distance learning program. . Formulating Research Questions Formulating Research Questions For a problem-solution paper, I have to start by stating the problem and then thinking about how to solve it. Based on what I've read so far, the problem seems to be that distance learning is basically a good thing but it can make education less personal and more passive. So my central question is how can YSU set up a distance learning program that works well.</td>
