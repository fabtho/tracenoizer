<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" Based on what I've read so far, the problem seems to be that distance learning is basically a good thing but it can make education less personal and more passive. So my central question is how can YSU set up a distance learning program that works well. In order to answer this, I'll have to look at things like how other schools have done it, what problems people see with it, and what suggestions they have for doing it well. I'd also like to talk with some YSU students and teachers about how they feel about it. Maybe I should try to talk to whoever it is at YSU who's in charge of this, to find out where they are in the process.">

 Colorado's Southwest Regional Library Service System The Southwest Regional Library Service System (SWRLSS - pronounced "swirls") is one of seven legislatively-created regional library systems in Colorado. SWRLSS works for, with and through its member libraries. Its mission is to strengthen, support and equalize member library services by providing and enhancing leadership, providing services and access to resources, and encouraging cooperation among libraries in order to improve public access to information. Other libraries in those same counties may be associate members. Each full member agency is entitled to a representative on the Membership Council.</td>

 Beginning in 1980, the registration requirement resumed. Today, young men must register within 30 days of their eighteenth birthday. In the event of a mobilization, a lottery drawing would determine the order in which men would be called. The first priority group would be men in the calendar year of their twentieth birthday. Learn more about the SSS history as well as conscientious objection and women and the draft.</td>
