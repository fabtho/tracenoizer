 Use the on-line catalog or archival finding aids to search for collection materials not represented on our web pages, or check with the Rare Book, Manuscript, and Special Collections Library research services staff or the main library reference staff for help. . John Hope Franklin Collection of African and African-American Documentation The Franklin Collection seeks to identify and preserve materials generated by (rather than simply about) people of African descent, and to make these materials widely available for research and teaching. Sallie Bingham Center for Women's History and Culture Collections in the Bingham Center document the public and private lives of women and the cultural contexts which have shaped them.

 Our method addressed the Traveling Salesman Problem as a representative test-bed. The method is gaining wide acceptance, in particular in well-known combinatorial optimization problems where large instances have been solved to optimality and where other metaheuristics have failed. An open research issue is to understand which features of the representation chosen had lead to characteristics of the objective functions which are efficiently exploited by a memetic approach. The purpose of this page is to unify the information about memetic algorithms which is available for public access on the Web as well as to indentify other work which is currently unknown to us on the same kind of methodology. Please send us information about any other work you consider it should be included in this page.</td>
