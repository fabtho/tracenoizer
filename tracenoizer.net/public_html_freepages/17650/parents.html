 It's obvious the child has been told lies or has overheard things about us as he completely changed towards us over night. We are heartbroken and can't seem to make our son understand what's happening. Only today I told my son that the parents must also cultivate the relationship before it will grow. The daughter-in-law has made our lives a living hell and we are denied the pleasure of our grandson and son.

 In its seventh year, the Pinnacle Awards are bestowed jointly by The Record and the San Joaquin County Office of Education on students to recognize their academic excellence, community service and citizenship. A reception for the recipients was held in April at University of the Pacific's Raymond Great Hall. More than 200 students, parents, teachers and school officials attended the event, sponsored by The Record and UOP. "It is our honor to recognize these fine students for their leadership and academic achievements," Record Publisher and President Roger Coover said of this year's Pinnacle Award winners. The Pinnacle Team represents the top 1 percent of the senior class at each high school in the two counties.</td>
