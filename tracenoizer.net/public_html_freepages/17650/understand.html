 His grandfather is severely dyslexic, his dad is mildly dyslexic, and it looks to me like Jake is also dyslexic, and fairly severely at that. My husband and I have never had him tested, we just weren't sure what difference it would make, but now are rethinking the whole thing. I think giving it a name will help my son understand he is not dumb. I hope it does not give him an excuse to stop trying. We do not want to pursue testing in the public schools, we will need to seek private help.</td>
