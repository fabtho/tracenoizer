 This book offers many practical ways to help parents join us in making sure that their children learn. Educators are fully aware of the key role parents must play if we are to be successful in educating every child. Burns has managed to capture the essence of their role offering hundreds of ideas to parents on how to be top parents for top students. The belief that all children can be successful is the basis of this book. I recommend this book to anyone looking for resources to help parents with the education of their children.</td>
