 " The program recognizes well-rounded students who possess both a strong academic record and a commitment to community service, which are "good predictors of future success," he said. Wentworth said he was particularly impressed by the level of student achievement and the diversity of careers the winners plan to pursue once they get out of school. Many plan to study mathematics, English, the sciences and other subjects at top colleges and universities once they graduate. "It's nice to have this kind of recognition," he said. com Pinnacle Award Winners Bear Creek High School Brookside Christian High School Calaveras High School East Union High School Edison High School Jim Elliot Christian High School Escalon High School Franklin High School Bret Harte High School Lincoln High School Linden High School Lodi Academy Lodi High School Manteca High School Ripon Christian High School Ripon High School Sierra High School Stagg Amos Alonzo Stagg High School St.</td>
