 In this context documentation is undertaken before, during, and after a specific project. This is in addition to the more typical object-oriented doumentation, described below.

 The Shanghai Daily newspaper said the problem was so bad that a special national database would be set up to track students' credit worthiness. Officials complain that some students are using bank loans to buy expensive jewellery for their girlfriends Special low interest education loans were introduced three years ago to help poor Chinese students cope with rising education costs. But some students have found them hard to repay, while others have reportedly exploited the system to fund expensive lifestyles. The loan system was introduced after China's once-free universities began charging tuition fees. Students can repay the loans interest free during their studies, or at low-interest rates once they find a job.</td>
