 This breakfast has been held at the Western Expo every year since 1994. The dairy product category was added this year because of the re-emergence of dairy products in vending. Freshley's Jumbo Honey Bun grabbed top honors for the second straight year, having first won the competition in 1997. Coca-Cola Classic, winner in the beverage category, has commanded the top spot more than any other beverage contender in the last eight years.
