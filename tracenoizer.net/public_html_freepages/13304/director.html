 The general worthlessness of its products stands in inverse proportion to their domination of the world's movie screens, a domination so overwhelming as to form a kind of censorship. No one in Detroit or Cleveland or Pittsburgh, for example, will be likely to see any of the more interesting works screened at the festival. In New York, Toronto or Los Angeles one might be able at best to see the occasional Iranian film or perhaps Chinese director Zhang Yimou's amusing new work, Keep Cool. Even an interesting independent American film, like Sue (with a luminous performance by actress Anna Thomson), directed by Amos Kollek, is unlikely to become available to large numbers of Americans. Nonparticipation in the commercial film industry, of course, is no guarantee of anything.</td>

 When Jack tells her that the Sea Hawks will win 19-13 that night, that there will be hail the following day, and that Lanie will die next Thursday, she laughs it off until the first two predictions come eerily true. Lanie then puts her life under the microscope and finds that what she thought was her pursuit of happiness has in fact become a soulless wild goose chase after worthless objectives. These are textbook lives of quiet desperation, and if we were living in the early 1950s, when flophouse despair was being newly explored on stage and screen, writer-director Adam Rifkin (The Dark Backward) might be deemed a fresh voice. Junnie (Andre Blake), his womanizing older brother, decides to demonstrate to Martin the art of "loving and leaving. To find a more lucrative, adult clientele, he hires himself out for bachelor parties as a transvestite striptease clown named Vulgar.</td>
