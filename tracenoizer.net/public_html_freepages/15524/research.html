We are using genomics technologies, such as gene expression microarrays and high throughput polymorphism detection, to determine relationships between molecular genetic changes and phenotypic changes that occur during the development and evolution of animals.

 The first set of data from this project is available in a companion database to the paper below. We hope that others will use a similar reference sample so that our data can be compared directly. cDNAs Available from Research Genetics These cDNAs can be used to construct your own DNA microarrays.

 He has been associated with Murdoch since 1992, when he started studying as an external student from NSW. He returned home in 1997 to finish his degree full-time, and has since completed 1st class honours in Environmental Science. He is currently studying towards a Master by research in the field of indoor air quality. Kevin is committed to ensuring the long-term environmental sustainability of the campus. He has been heavily involved with the Murdoch University Environmental Science Association (MUEnSA) for a number of years, and has served on the Guild Secretariat.</td>
