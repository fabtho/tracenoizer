 Current Research Using functional genomics approaches, my laboratory studies basic problems in developmental and evolutionary genetics. Primarily using Drosophila as a model system, we have three main areas of research. At the end of larval life, the release of the steroid hormone ecdysone is responsible for tissue-specific responses that result in the metamorphosis of Drosophila. Tissues such as larval salivary glands, muscles and gut undergo apoptosis in response to ecdysone while cells in tissues such as the imaginal discs undergo movement and differentiation. A network of transcription factors controls these diverse responses to this hormone.</td>
