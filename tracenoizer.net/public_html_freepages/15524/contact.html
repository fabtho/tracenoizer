 His rhymes are often comical, though he does put the comedy aside when he needs to speak about serious social issues. Kevin has been integral to the development of Up From The Roots, with performing solo, or with his rhyme partner Kash Klay, Kevin has left a memorable mark on the minds of those who've seen him perform. Please contact us if you would like to have Kevin perform in, or host an event for you. ..</td>
