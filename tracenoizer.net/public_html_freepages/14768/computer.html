 This site will wind its way through three interviews. The illustrations I've included give a few examples of new features that technology has brought to the art world, as well as an example of technology's success in creating more traditional art. One of the most common criticisms concerning computer art is that it's not art at all. Some critics feel that it is simply a series of mathematical principles, rather than an artisic rendering. Dan Gartlan points out that the end result of commercial art is just as much about communication as it is about looking nice, because it is a business, not a hobby.</td>
