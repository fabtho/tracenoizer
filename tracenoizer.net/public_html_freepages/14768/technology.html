 Coupled with the traditional body of knowledge that made up a 'good' education this approach made sense. Now a basis in Cognitive Psychology seems to be a better method for preparing students to become lifelong learners. Advances in educational technology have contributed and supported this swing toward the Cognitive approach. A brief background on each approach might be helpful. Skinner is considered the "grandfather of behaviorism".</td>

 Calibration is performed on a sinusoidal motion shaker. . Technology Pieozoelectric Theory Text The Piezoelectric Effect, Theory, Design and Usage PIEZOELECTRIC EFFECT The piezoelectric effect was discovered by Pierre and Jacques Curie in 1880. The property of certain crystals to exhibit electrical charges under mechanical loading was of no practical use until very high input impedance amplifiers enabled engineers to amplify their signals. In the 1950s, electrometer tubes of sufficient quality became available and the piezoelectric effect was commercialized.</td>
