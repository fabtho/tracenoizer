 . i have only noticed one wierd display problem when the display did not refresh a text file properly. i am actually sending this from the computer with the error message. after an already needed shutdown of the computer the error went away. as there where no disks or other devices that are full on this computer i will attempt to follow kurts suggestion and change the terminal settings.</td>

 I should mention that I am using Linux, a Unix-like operating system, to create and test files locally before I upload them to Shorenet, so some remarks will be puzzling to people who run Windows and have avoided using the shell prompt that Shorenet provides. You pay extra for cgi When I first started my personal website, it was by no means clear to me that my account did not allow cgi. The error messages still don't say this explicitly, and lord knows there are plenty of reasons for cgi scripts to fail. Now this point is covered fairly well on the website, but may still not be obvious to the experimenter. I recently found out about the cgi-wrapper, which allows the webserver to temporarily use my rights.</td>

 Whatever method you use to report a problem to us, it is Very Important that you be as specific and precise as you can be in describing the problem to us. It is FAR better to add details that may not seem important than to leave something important out. Always include any and all Error Messages as accurately and completely as you can. Always tell us What Machine you have had the problem on and Which Labs the problem seems to occur in. It is helpful to mention whether it is only your computer that is having problems or whether the problem affects all users in the lab.</td>
