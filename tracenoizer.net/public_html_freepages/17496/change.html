 0, additional descriptor and diagnostics fields have been introduced. x remain as connection and statement attributes in ODBC 3. Note that this is a change in naming only -- the semantics of these attributes remain the same. 0 API Enhancements In addition to aligning with the standards, the ODBC 3. 0 API specification has been enhanced by the inclusion of many new features.</td>
