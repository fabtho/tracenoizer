 uerf -R will list them in reverse order so you see the latest errors first. So someone on Your machine writes via NFS onto a disk on a different machine which is full. So something on your system is trying to write to a full NFS mounted file systems--'df' ought to identify the file system, but you may need something like lsof to find the process responsible. The above message seems to indicate that this disk write failed. I think you just have some bad blocks on your harddisk.</td>

 Now can I really change my (and my teams') habits and, if so, how should I change. Certainly using the 'nil' identity test is the correct thing to do for an unitialized variable. It also has to be used for at least some 'N1' and 'N2' that involve the standard libraries, so it might as well be used throughout a system. 'N4' seems to be required in VW because of the heavy loading in Object. I personally use a created distinguished object (or a special message) instead of 'nil' for special state distinguishing, but there are still other people who don't.</td>
