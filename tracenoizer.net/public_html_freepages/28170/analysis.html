<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" In order to profile active proteases, this project will make use of the specificity of chemically synthesized and natural protease inhibitors. Inhibitors will either be immobilized to beads or biotinylated followed by incubation with various purified proteases. Analysis of the bound proteins will be performed by peptide mapping and mass spectrometry. The initial part of this work will focus on establishing conditions under which specific proteases or protease families can be enriched and quantitatively bound. Subsequent work will be related to enriching certain proteases from biofluids following spiking with purified recombinant enzymes and finally from the original biofluids as obtained from clinical samples.">

 Data Resources by Subject provides two Data Cross-Reference Tables, the first comparing on-line sources based on types of data offered and the second evaluating sites based on ease of access. There is also a list of off-line sources compiled by the University of Minnesota's Government Publications Library. Census Regional Economic Information System (REIS) Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) Bureau of Labor Statistics ALMIS - America's Labor Market Information System Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) Labor Market Information Websites - all 50 States Yahoo's Calendar of Business Data Releases EconData. The State and Local Policy Program is a research center at the Hubert H. Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs of theUniversity of Minnesota.</td>

 . Millennium Development Goals The Millennium Development Goals set targets for reductions in poverty, improvements in health and education and protection of the environment. Statistical Capacity Building The World Bank offers technical assistance to member countries in need to create an adequate statistical base for the analysis of economic, financial and social developments necessary to guide policy making. International Comparison Program Internationally comparable data are crucial to forming sustainable policies and monitoring progress. Purchasing Power Parities account for price differences between countries and so measure real quantities.</td>
