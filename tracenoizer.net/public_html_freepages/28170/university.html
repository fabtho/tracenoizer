 The student experience overall is intensely social, but learning experiences are mostly solitary; social learning experiences are rare. Students rarely run computers without multi-tasking, and still use computers more for recreation than work. University students (at least in the 18-21 age bracket) are consistent in rejecting the basis of a virtual university. learning being a solitary experience is an interesting result - is there research to show how much learning is social or solitary in the absence of computers, and how much social life is spent without computers. (Garth Shephard, Envisage) Learning tends to be dominated by solitary experiences.</td>

 Downey aims to be master by Vivienne McCourt Paddy Downey (photo by Tommy Clancy) For the last two years he has studied for this masters as part of a home study course. He already has a Bachelor of Arts in Industrial Relations degree from the National College if Ireland (formerly the National College of Industrial Relations) in Ranelagh. However, Paddy finds that the arrangement with Keele University suits his hectic lifestyle much better. With a home study course you still have readings, essays and a thesis to complete but you don't have to attend lectures like in a traditional college. Seminars are held every three months in Ireland where university lecturers come over from Keele to lecture for a period of two or three days.</td>
