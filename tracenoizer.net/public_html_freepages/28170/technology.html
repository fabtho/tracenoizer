 The entire spacecraft must be able to pass unaffected through temperature regimes ranging from the intense cold of the Earth's shadow to the radiant glare of the sun, and must withstand exposure to the natural radiation of space. High-performance space systems are rarely accessible once launched and in orbit. They rely on miniaturization techniques, new materials, and computer technology to enhance performance. Space projects are unforgiving of any form of neglect or human error, particularly in engineering. Their actual performance can't be tested fully before they are sent into space, because the space and launch environment cannot be fully simulated on Earth.</td>

 Short term initiatives supporting ad-hoc projects result in pockets of innovation in university structures, but these are rarely systemised or managed, so a network of virtual universities cannot develop. Universities need to be able to be more integrated institutions with an enhanced capacity for internal knowledge management. School children are becoming more au-fait with IT technology at a younger age, which has the potential to change the face of university education. (Marian Brooks, Cranford Community College) This is interesting since children entering university will have new social models including IT. This contrasts with most current university intake where the IT has been bolted on at a much later stage (Geoff Robinson, Ordnance Survey) London universities are massive and highly devolved, however they are flying in the face of adversity and have an extraordinarily high provision for using IT.</td>
