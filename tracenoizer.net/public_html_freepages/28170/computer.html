 The entire spacecraft must be able to pass unaffected through temperature regimes ranging from the intense cold of the Earth's shadow to the radiant glare of the sun, and must withstand exposure to the natural radiation of space. High-performance space systems are rarely accessible once launched and in orbit. They rely on miniaturization techniques, new materials, and computer technology to enhance performance. Space projects are unforgiving of any form of neglect or human error, particularly in engineering. Their actual performance can't be tested fully before they are sent into space, because the space and launch environment cannot be fully simulated on Earth.</td>

 and how well placed to respond is the university base. (Jeremy Allen, DTI) Universities from other countries have penetrated the UK market in a minor way. The virtual university may find it hard to break into the UK market, however it appears that the traditional university may fall behind if it does not take advantage of joined up technologies to develop complete computer support systems with administration and teaching processes combined. UK universities will always have the advantage of language, however far behind they might fall in technological terms. Here we have a situation where possibly the answer is in the schools.</td>
