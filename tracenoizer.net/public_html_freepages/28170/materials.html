 . Vehicle Suspension System Challenge Vehicle Suspension System Challenge This activity will challenge students to design and construct a suspension system for a test vehicle that will minimize the pitch and roll effects created as the vehicle travels across an obstacle test track. Students will test a wide variety of materials and designs as they create an efficient suspension system. The test track may include a variety of obstacles to challenge students as they try to engineer a smooth ride over the course. The software will monitor and display the pitch and roll values of the suspension system.</td>

 The entire spacecraft must be able to pass unaffected through temperature regimes ranging from the intense cold of the Earth's shadow to the radiant glare of the sun, and must withstand exposure to the natural radiation of space. High-performance space systems are rarely accessible once launched and in orbit. They rely on miniaturization techniques, new materials, and computer technology to enhance performance. Space projects are unforgiving of any form of neglect or human error, particularly in engineering. Their actual performance can't be tested fully before they are sent into space, because the space and launch environment cannot be fully simulated on Earth.</td>

 NFA also offers without charge, a number of informative publications regarding its regulatory activities and futures trading. CTAs' Disclosure Documents are required to be submitted to the CFTC for review in advance of distribution to prospective investors. On an ongoing basis, NFA audits Disclosure Documents (particularly performance information), promotional materials, and trading activities. Violations of CFTC or NFA rules can result in a loss of trading privileges and other penalties. Return to Questions Past Performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.</td>
