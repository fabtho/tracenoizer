Eggs are laid in the soil in mid-summer, primarily on well-watered lawns in full sun, often near pavement.

 If my child does have a delay, what could be causing it. That depends on whether the problem is physical or cognitive. Some children will have delays in a particular area, such as walking, while the rest of their skills continue developing on or ahead of schedule. If that's the case for your child, it may just mean he's concentrating so hard on talking or understanding that he's pushed walking to a back burner for the moment and will work on it again when he's ready. But if you're concerned, be sure to bring it up with your child's doctor.</td>
