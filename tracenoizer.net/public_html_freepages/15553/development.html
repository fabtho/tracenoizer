 We are also taking bioinformatics approaches to both types of problems. . We are using functional genomics approaches to study development and evolution. The first focuses on the problem of building genome-wide regulatory networks. People working on this problem are using the transcriptional response to the hormone ecdysone to map the genetic circuitry responsible for life cycle transitions in Drosophila melanogaster.</td>

 His wit and humour has lead to several offers for him to host events. His rhymes are often comical, though he does put the comedy aside when he needs to speak about serious social issues. Kevin has been integral to the development of Up From The Roots, with performing solo, or with his rhyme partner Kash Klay, Kevin has left a memorable mark on the minds of those who've seen him perform. Please contact us if you would like to have Kevin perform in, or host an event for you. .</td>
