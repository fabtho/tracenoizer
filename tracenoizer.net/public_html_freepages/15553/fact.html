 " He went on to say that "ten years from now, those doctors that do not use nutrition or preventative medicine will have a hard time finding patients. 's that use nutrition as their primary specialty are sometimes blacklisted by their fellow physicians. Belenyessy then told me that for a baby cow, cow's milk was an excellent food, and though he doesn't advise against the use of milk for all of his patients, he doesn't recommend dairy products for general consumption due to the fact that many people have varying degrees of undiagnosed allergic reactions to dairy products. He said that milk in particular is mucus-forming, thus contributing to stuffy noses, runny eyes and upper respiratory problems. The good doctor explained that many people cannot digest milk sugar (lactose), and that if one insists on using dairy products, one should use yogurt since some of the beneficial bacteria present in yogurt aids in lactose digestion.</td>

 Roach problems pester residents in White Hall By Karen Feldscher ousing officials said this week they are determined to curb a cockroach infestation in White Hall, following months of student complaints that the pests have proliferated in a first-floor kitchen and several adjoining rooms. "Pest control is a serious issue," said John Niven, associate director of residential life. " Several students living on the first floor of White Hall say there are still cockroaches in the common kitchen area and in some nearby dorm rooms, despite the fact that exterminators have sprayed the kitchen on a regular basis in recent weeks. "New signs just went up saying to clean up after yourself in the kitchen, but I think that's the wrong approach. " Vasudeva and several other graduate students said they think the university should do more than just spray periodically and remind students to clean up after themselves.</td>
