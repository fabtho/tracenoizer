 I personally haven't received any Snow White stuff for a couple of days now, so hopefully the problem has been fixed. . I wanted to let everyone know that we're aware of the problem, and taking steps to prevent it from continuing. It's a variation of that Melissa virus or something (sorry, I haven't even used a windows machine in months, I don't follow the virus thing anymore). Anyway, don't open it, update your virus software, yada yada.</td>
