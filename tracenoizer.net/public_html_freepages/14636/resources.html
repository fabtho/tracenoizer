 Attendance was by invitation and provided an opportunity for Inuit leaders and Inuit business representatives to discuss issues such as access to and sharing of information, technology, capital, marketing and business development with selected business leaders from Southern Canada. Copies of the report that was prepared for this symposium are available from Inuit Tapirisat of Canada. In his remarks to the symposium, Ken Drolet extended his thanks to Aboriginal Business Canada for providing significant financial support for this project and emphasized his pride in PAIL's role in bringing together the information base and other resources necessary for producing this first comprehensive, electronically searchable database of all Inuit-owned business enterprises in Canada. Using a notebook computer and an associated electronic projector, Ken Drolet then took symposium participants on a virtual tour of the Inuit Business Directory and demonstrated the different ways that searches could be made of the IBD database for various types of information on Inuit business enterprises. .</td>
