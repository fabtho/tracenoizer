<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" In the case of projects focused on building customer relationships, we have a longer-term perspective. It needs to become second nature to think how the Internet can help in the daily job, how it can improve the relationships with the customers and how it can help driving competitive advantage. In the UK, we think we are the first pharma company to be carrying out live e-detailing. A substantial market research project done last year identified numerous opportunities, but also highlighted major challenges that need to be surmounted before e-detailing can become a routine promotional tool. Finally, inside companies like Novartis, applications of the Internet will become daily practice and will enable impressive productivity and job satisfaction gains.">
