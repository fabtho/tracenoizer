 David Pearson joined Novartis Pharma in the United States in 1985. His career has spanned most pharma business functions, several international markets and two stints in the Novartis headquarters in Basel, Switzerland. Early in 2000, David took the opportunity to help kick-start the e-Business activities of Novartis headquarters and, in October 2000, became the e-business director of Novartis Pharma in the UK and a member of the Novartis e-Business Board. In this article, David explains some of the e-initiatives he and his team have launched at Novartis, describes the excitement from seeing first results and speaks about the challenges he is facing. My career has been mostly within sales and marketing management (in the United States, in the Swiss market and in the headquarters) and general management (two years as Managing Director of Novartis Czech Republic).</td>
