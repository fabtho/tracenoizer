 This allows developers who do not necessarily need the capabilities of XML Schemas to forego their use and start sending messages with encoding rules based on an accepted URI. Although we can have encoding without a corresponding schema, it's not recommended. Most XML parsers will soon be schema-aware (in fact, some like Xerces already are), and we can save ourselves a lot of trouble when parsing messages if we rely on the parser and schema to validate and convert data instead of doing it manually. SOAP Encoding The SOAP Specification defines a single set of encoding rules that are referred to as SOAP encoding. SOAP encoding is based on XML Schemas and as such it closely models many of the standard types and constructs that developers would be familiar with.</td>
