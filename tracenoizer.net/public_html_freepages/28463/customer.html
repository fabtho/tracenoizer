When you order the Mail Order Business In-A-Box, you'll own unlimited reprint and duplication rights to some of the hottest products that have ever been made for this type of marketing. This means that when a customer orders a product from you, your only cost will be the cost to reproduce and deliver that product. This completely cuts out the middle-men, and means you get to keep all the profit. And, there is no limit to the number of copies or duplicates you can make.">
