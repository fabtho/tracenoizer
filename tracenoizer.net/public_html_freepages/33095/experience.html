 When traffic is low i also encourage the hosts to think of ways to bring people in. I have read most of Howard Rheingold's book and have just bought Cliff Figallo's book thought I haven't had time to read it yet. Most of my practical online experience has been in MOOs rather than in list-based communities, and I have a strong sense of etiquette derived from that. I try to learn from you and other people on the Hosts list. I prefer, however, that decisions be taken democratically, so I am trying to learn how to ensure that this happens.</td>
