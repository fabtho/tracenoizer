 Unless they are really obviously offensive and need urgent action, take a few hours to think it through before you respond to 'problem' posts. Learn from other hosts by lurking or participating on other lists. I also draw on my own imagination and ideas to think of new ways to handle problems and stimulate interaction. I also get personal enjoyment from reading and participating. The current upsurge in communities will not last but I think it will settle to a level whereby most net users are members of at least one community, whether it be work, educational, social or family based.</td>

 I'm deaf and I can read lips really well like she does which i'm grateful for that. .com Click here for Guide 2 Games Technical problems. Sunday night series is a coming-of-age, suspenseful drama starring Deanne Bray, a severely deaf actress who like Sue Thomas, was strongly encouraged by her parents to speak and read lips. As portrayed in the series, Thomas (Bray) is a somewhat sheltered young deaf woman who has recently graduated from college and is about to start her first real job - which happens to be with the F.</td>
