 She's one hard-headed, soft-hearted woman whose talent for reading lips helps crack crimes and bag the bad guys in places listening devices can't penetrate. With her hearing-ear dog, Levi, Sue's a glutton for jeopardy - and there's (almost) nothing she won't do to bring notorious criminals to justice. This remarkable, edge-of-your-seat drama is an inspiring tribute to the ability of the human spirit to overcome adversity and achieve great things.

 I try to learn from you and other people on the Hosts list. I prefer, however, that decisions be taken democratically, so I am trying to learn how to ensure that this happens. However, there is already a clear sense that Barbara and Christy have both imbued their conferences with their own personalities and I am delighted that this has happened - so the strength I most value is an ability to empower the hosts. Unless they are really obviously offensive and need urgent action, take a few hours to think it through before you respond to 'problem' posts. Learn from other hosts by lurking or participating on other lists.</td>
