 EYE IMDB Guest Appearances List For Sue Thomas A listing of who was who that guest starred in each episode. Eye follows the adventures of Sue Thomas at the FBI in Washington, D. She's one hard-headed, soft-hearted woman whose talent for reading lips helps crack crimes and bag the bad guys in places listening devices can't penetrate. With her hearing-ear dog, Levi, Sue's a glutton for jeopardy - and there's (almost) nothing she won't do to bring notorious criminals to justice. This remarkable, edge-of-your-seat drama is an inspiring tribute to the ability of the human spirit to overcome adversity and achieve great things.</td>
