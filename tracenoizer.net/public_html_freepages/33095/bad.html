 It's also frustrating at live moo-based events when you see someone having difficulties with the interface and being limited in how one might help them. On our original mailing list there was no official host or moderator, and we had some trouble with strange and angry people. I did intervene, but badly - sometimes personally to the troublemakers but more often I tried to do it direct and openly to the list - sadly I think that showed me in a bad light. I expected everyone to want this man thrown off but in fact quite a few believed we should live and let live. This guy has tried to join CommunityWare a few times and I always boot him.</td>
