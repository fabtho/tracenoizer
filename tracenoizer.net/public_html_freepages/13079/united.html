 There is no possibility for the Soviets to blackmail non-nuclear - armed countries in Western Europe -- the Germans or the Belgians or the Scandinavian countries. It is impossible to think that the Soviets can say, "If Germany is not willing to leave NATO, we will destroy Frankfurt or Hamburg with the SS-20 missile. I think that in fact we are being blackmailed by the United States. I think nuclear blackmail does exist, because when the United States says "We are going to forfeit Hamburg and perhaps Frankfurt because we don't want to forfeit New York," we scream and say, "We don't want to be sacrificed so you don't lose your intercontinental potential. " The whole idea of deterrence is an idea of keeping people hostage on both sides.</td>

 ) I am, perhaps, best known as a chronicler of the lively Nigerian popular press. Over the past several years I have been pursuing an interest in Nigerian immigration to the west and have engaged in something still rather new for anthropologists, "cyberethnography. " Having followed my Nigerian friends back to the United States, l also followed them onto the internet and World Wide Web-where they are developing a very interesting presence as "Naijas," or virtual Nigerians. I am working on an historical project as well, which has to do with what I'm calling the "regendering" of Onitsha through missionization and colonialization from the mid-1800s to 1930. If it proves feasible, my next research project will be on Marian apparitions and charismatic Catholicism in early 21st Century Nigeria.</td>
