 I try to get the basic stuff working as soon as possible to see whether the design and the ideas that I had actually work like I expected. When they do it's a matter of filling up the gaps and getting the details right. It was a nice computer but it was a very closed product. If you wanted to extend it in anyway you needed to buy all kinds of expensive TI hardware. My second computer, a Commodore 64, was a delight in that respect.</td>

 Math SurfThis is a site that provides numerous math problems and magazine type resources. MathlinksThis is an interactive site for students who need remedial and challenged work on math problem solving. LessonPlans Exploring the National Math Trail Math Magic Problem Solving Challenges The Problem Solving Stowaway Adventure Using the Internet The Internet is a great source of information which my class will utilize in my classroom and the KES computer lab on a daily basis. I will subscribe to online databases for additional resources for student access for intended projects. I will also utilize various web sites for coordinating lessons and resources for my self-directed proposal involving alternative math problem solving formats and programming utilizing the internet.</td>
