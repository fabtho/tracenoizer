 I will continue to refer to 2), 3) and 4) wrt performance for reference, but apart from that they are beyond the scope of this paper. As an example I have split up the startup times of the 'kedit' application into 1), 2), 3) and 4), times are measured on a Pentium III running at 500Mhz. All data is assumed to be already in memory so disk access should not play a role. 48 sec --------------------------------------------- Total 1. 37 sec This illustrates that run-time link performance is the major bottleneck when it comes to providing a "fast" desktop environment.</td>
