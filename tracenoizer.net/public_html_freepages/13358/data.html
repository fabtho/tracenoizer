 For example, a Windows GIS might allow emergency planners to easily calculate emergency response times in the event of a natural disaster, or a GIS might be used to find wetlands that need protection from pollution. It's like a mapping software package combined with a database plus analytics. Practitioners also regard the total GIS software or mapping software solution as including operating personnel and the data that go into the system. A GIS, which can use information from many different sources, in many different forms can help with such analyses. The primary requirement for the GIS source data is that the locations for the variables are known.</td>
