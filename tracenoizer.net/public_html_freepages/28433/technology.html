 The United Nations Sudano - Sahelian Office ( UNSO) mission visited Tanzania in 1989 recommended in its mission report that there was need for institutions using or producing environmental information to sit around the table and sort out issues related to information management. CURRENT SITUATION Information in our country is not adequately managed due to a number of factors. Information that does exist is dispersed in various offices and thus unknown Even when information is available, it is not easily accessible due to inadequate or lack of appropriate technology for effective access. Some institutions tend to withhold information and thus make it not available to users. Reasons for this is not known, it can either be for personal or political reasons.</td>
