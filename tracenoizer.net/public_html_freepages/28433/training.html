 AEDs are easy-to-use, portable devices that deliver a potentially lifesaving electric shock to the heart, which can restore a heart's normal rhythm in the event of sudden cardiac arrest. Immediate use of an AED, in conjunction with CPR, could save up to 50,000 lives a year. Project Lifesaver is designed to help communities plan and implement access to defibrillation programs by providing AED education, training, support for state and federal AED legislation, as well as urging communities to obtain AEDs. The American Red Cross envisions every American being within four minutes of an AED and someone trained to use it in the event of sudden cardiac arrest. To make this possible, the American Red Cross is bringing life-saving AED training to communities and companies like yours.</td>
