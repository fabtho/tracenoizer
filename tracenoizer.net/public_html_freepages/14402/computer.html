 There is a proposal where there would have to be a three year period, during which these individuals would have to work in their own country before they can apply. If those individuals do not have the opportunity to practice their skills in the United States upon graduation, there is a lesser likelihood that they would stay here and, instead, they would take their talents elsewhere. India has the world's largest population of computer programmers, to my knowledge. And, I am sure, China is another large talent pool. Now, if these projects are exported, then the jobs are exported.</td>

write(dateMsg()); Looking for Clues About How Proteins Talk to Each Other Physicists at the Department of Energy's Brookhaven National Laboratory reveal that interactions among proteins at the cellular level are not random, but well organized. The results of this study are published in the May 3, 2002, issue of Science. In the new study, Maslov and physicist Kim Sneppen of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology used computer modeling to look at how proteins interact with each other. Molecular Shuttling The Department of Energy's Sandia National Laboratory researchers observed molecular shuttling on a man-made membrane that mimics cellular behavior. Recurring movements may evolve into rudimentary tools of nanoconstruction.</td>
