For example, your 16-year-old son might tell you that he has no night that would work for him. If something like this comes up in your family meeting, it is time once again to explain the importance of your family coming together once a week, and that there are six other nights of the week they each of you can "do your own thing", but this one night is where we put other things aside for about an hour. Decide what day of the week you will hold your family night, and then determine the time.

 The iris hatchway of the inner door spiraled open and I stepped into the decompression chamber. Of course, the seal of the connecting tunnel was likely to be a hundred percent perfect, but I still ran an outside pressure check just to be sure. That was one of the things the Starpilot Academy back on Lave stressed as being an absolute must. Naturally, based on their reasoning, I decided to adhere to the rule as well. The large hatchway opened itself like an eye adjusting to darkness, though on the other side of the door was a brightly lit tunnel leading away toward the weightless hub of the space station.</td>
