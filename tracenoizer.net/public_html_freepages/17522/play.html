Come up with one job for each person in your family and rotate these each week. I should also add, that on occasion, you may want to skip the whole family night schedule and all go out to a movie, or to play miniature golf. Like I have mentioned before, it doesn't matter what you do, or when you do it, the only thing that matters is you do it together. Think of what will work best for your family and start your family night this week.">

 Pepe and Julien the clowns thrilled the children with their juggling, stilt walking and unicycling. Action Songs and Rhymes were provided by Edna Hemmings who stood in at short notice for Amanda Frolick - thank you Edna you wore great. Sports and Games for older children were provided by the Play Service and fortunately the weather was on our side. The older children particularly enjoyed the half hourly Computer Sessions. Lucy from Sunlight was there cooking in the kitchen - the food was delicious and enjoyed by all.</td>
