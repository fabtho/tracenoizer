The large hatchway opened itself like an eye adjusting to darkness, though on the other side of the door was a brightly lit tunnel leading away toward the weightless hub of the space station. I stepped one foot past the red-outlined perimeter of the Dagger's artificial gravity zone, leaned forward, felt my insides become slightly disoriented by the sudden shift to weightlessness, and reached for the bright red hand rail. I pulled the rest of my body into the tunnel and experienced the still-highly-enjoyable sensation of suddenly having grown a huge pair of invisible wings that kept me aloft. The Dagger's outer hatch closed as I effortlessly pushed away from my craft and glided up the connecting tunnel and into the very center of Boston Base.</td>
