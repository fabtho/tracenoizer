 The system features a hand held CIP system for cleaning of the enclosure and airlock, fully automated control panel to indicate pressure, humidity, temperature and dew point. . The system features a production glovebox, a dispensing glovebox, and an autoclave glovebox. The gloveboxes are designed to connect together with sealed pass-through doors between each glovebox. These turnkey systems featured exclusive type 316L stainless construction, push-thru gloveports and HEPA filters, and a CIP with sanitary drain system.</td>

 . A Safe Change Oriented Process for Safety-Critical Systems (ResearchIndex) A. In building such a complex system, change is inevitable. This paper discusses the aims of CONVERSE, an EPSRC-funded project to investigate change management in safety-critical software development. The aim is to reduce the costs which occur due to change, while allowing rapid recollection of the safety evidence required for such systems.</td>
