 Elite Federation bounties were nice incentives for pilots to blast each other out of the sky. Actually, when my ID check confirmed that I really was Maximillian Weaver, there was a noticeable air of annoyance from the deck coordinators. After a half an hour of discussions with various enlisted folks who managed personnel assignments, I went to see Lieutenant Schroeder, the senior personnel officer. So, either you ship out and either pass the time away in a parking orbit, stop off at a civilian port in a neighboring star system, or we could assign you to an earlier training unit. All that waiting to be approved for an INRA assignment only to be denied because I arrived on station early.</td>

 Action Songs and Rhymes were provided by Edna Hemmings who stood in at short notice for Amanda Frolick - thank you Edna you wore great. Sports and Games for older children were provided by the Play Service and fortunately the weather was on our side. The older children particularly enjoyed the half hourly Computer Sessions. Lucy from Sunlight was there cooking in the kitchen - the food was delicious and enjoyed by all. As well as entertainment for the children Councillor Crawford held surgery sessions and there were numerous information stalls for the adults supplied by a variety of community groups concerned with children's issues.</td>
