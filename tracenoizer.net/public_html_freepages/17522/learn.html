 Activities need to be open-ended allowing for all sorts of possibilities, and facilitated by a teacher who knows how to ask the right question or get out the right stepping stone. They are learning the power of words; about more or less; big and small; too much and not enough.

Omega staff are warm, friendly and enjoy working with children within a multi-cultural setting. They strive to work in partnership with parents and carers in meeting childcare needs.</td>
