 Pepe and Julien the clowns thrilled the children with their juggling, stilt walking and unicycling. Action Songs and Rhymes were provided by Edna Hemmings who stood in at short notice for Amanda Frolick - thank you Edna you wore great. Sports and Games for older children were provided by the Play Service and fortunately the weather was on our side. The older children particularly enjoyed the half hourly Computer Sessions. Lucy from Sunlight was there cooking in the kitchen - the food was delicious and enjoyed by all.</td>
