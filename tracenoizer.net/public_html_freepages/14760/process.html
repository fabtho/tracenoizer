 A 20 kDa DNase was detected only in senescent leaves, which suggested that fragmented DNA would be caused by this DNase. Studies on animals have shown that the execution of programmed cell death (PCD) or apoptosis is controlled by a multistep signaling pathway (McConkey and Orrenius 1994, Stewart 1994). Like in animals, it is called as physiological cell death for development and defense (Greenberg 1996), so it may be that any complex multicellular organism will be found cell death a usuful process to have in its repertoire. At the molecular level, till now, more than 30 leaf senescence associated genes (SAGs) have been isolated, cloned and characterized. Most of them encode enzymes that are thought to be involved in cell degeneration and nutrient mobilization, whereas the identity of some SAGs remains unknown (Basanti et al.</td>

 . CEDRO Centrum voor Drugsonderzoek Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences, SCO-Kohnstamm Instituut Wibautstraat 4, 1091 GM Amsterdam P. This book gives an overview of the EU's anti-drugs measures and focuses on its decision-making process. It looks at why drugs have acquired a prominent position on the European political agenda and identifies the political function they serve there. This study shows that instead of solving the drugs problem, the EU's bureaucracy actually helps to keep it alive and well.</td>
