 Percussion Plus, Tama, and Pearl drums and hardware. . The band has been together for less than half a year, but has already recorded 2 demo CD's and has played shows all across North Carolina and Florida. Justin Harvey and Stephen Beeson decided to get a band together in the spring of 2001 at Appalachian State University. They wanted to go against the trends of the scene and play fast melodic punk as opposed to the emo, and acoustic college rock that rules the area.</td>
