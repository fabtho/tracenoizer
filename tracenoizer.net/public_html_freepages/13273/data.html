The Data Mining Group of the Department of Computer Science, University of Durham, has been using data mining algorithms embedded within virtual worlds for data analysis. The activities of users and providers of telecommunications services produce vast amounts of data (typically 15 megabytes every 15 minutes) with many attributes. For telecommunications providers a major priority is to monitor traffic usage so that they can give their customers enough bandwidth to transport information - and so they can determine and eliminate fraud.</td>

 Start with a lightweight "data warehouse bus architecture" of conformed dimensions and conformed facts, and build your data warehouse iteratively. . But, as important as this job is, I have often felt overwhelmed when I listen to someone explain all the data warehouse manager's responsibilities. Sometimes I find that casting data warehouse responsibilities in the negative is an effective way to cut through the vagueness. We've always been told what to do; now let's balance the list with what not to do.</td>

 In his series of four paintings, Jan van Kessel portrayed cultural knowledge representations of the four continents known in his day. The immaterial character of these virtual antarctic 'substance' can only develop meaning and effectiveness (much as in the 17th century) if these items are developed in independent constructs, which never the less remain in distance but related to their antarctic reference subjects. As the given empirical facts are both real and fictitious, the data space give rise to phenomena which are difficult to conceptualize - a Computer Aided Reality. These data-bodies incorporate data sets of current antarctic research projects, which symbolize direct real-time links to the reference subjects occurring in scientific research and the underlying natural events at the South Pole. The visitor navigates parallel in a global area in the Internet as well as in a local computed model of the DTWKS environment at ISEA.</td>
