 It is expected LIGO will be able to detect and measure gravitational waves out to distances of 70 million light-years from Earth. . LIGO is a scientific collaboration of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and is funded by the National Science Foundation. At a dedication ceremony held for the LIGO facility in Livingston, Louisiana on Nov. The beam tubes and associated chambers comprise one of the world's largest vacuum systems, with a volume of nearly 350,000 cubic feet at each facility.</td>
