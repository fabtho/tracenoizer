 Most people will not have previously heard that every country in the world has drug prohibition. Unusual as it seems, almost nobody knows about the existence of world-wide drug prohibition. The Swedish drug control system by Tim Boekhout van Solinge This book appeared in 1997, and can now be downloaded from this website. It is the first thorough analysis of Swedish drug policy and critically examines the claims about drug use and drug policy in Sweden. Their book of over 800 pages is the most extensive work on the legal control of both licit and illicit drugs in France.</td>

 In graduate school, I once cleaned my kitchen floor with a toothbrush rather than face up to my dissertation research. Yet the risk of looking dumb is exactly the risk we ask students to take. Not that all research is scary, and like a good portfolio manager, you learn to control risk. A balance needs to be struck between barely incremental re-search for things that you, or someone else, already found, and the maddening vertigo of trying something so new that you haven't the foggiest idea what to do. As a professor, if you are going to talk the talk, you have got to walk the walk.</td>
