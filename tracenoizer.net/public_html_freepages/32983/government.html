 The mineral owner has the right to access and develop the mineral estate regardless of the management area in which the mineral estate is located and the operating procedures set forth through the Forest Plan. However, in most cases, the title to the mineral estate includes provisions to require the many mineral owners to develop access plans with the Forest Service in accordance with Title 36 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 251. In those cases where access to the mineral estate would adversely affect other Forest resource values, the Government can negotiate a settlement with the mineral owner to avoid the impacts. ..</td>

 Reserved rights, however, share two crucial similarities with prior appropriation rights. Second, senior rights are satisfied before junior rights. Or, do the tribes have reserved water rights only because their present lands are reservation lands, granted to them by the federal government. If this is the case, then their rights are limited by the terms of their treaties, as ratified by Congress, and any other Congressional laws governing Indian rights and activities. The court reasoned that the Fort Belknap reservation lands, set aside so that tribal members might become self-sufficient farmers and ranchers, could hardly fulfill that purpose if it didn't have enough water for irrigation and stockwatering.</td>
