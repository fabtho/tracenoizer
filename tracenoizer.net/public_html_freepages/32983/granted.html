 Reserved rights, however, share two crucial similarities with prior appropriation rights. Second, senior rights are satisfied before junior rights. Or, do the tribes have reserved water rights only because their present lands are reservation lands, granted to them by the federal government. If this is the case, then their rights are limited by the terms of their treaties, as ratified by Congress, and any other Congressional laws governing Indian rights and activities. The court reasoned that the Fort Belknap reservation lands, set aside so that tribal members might become self-sufficient farmers and ranchers, could hardly fulfill that purpose if it didn't have enough water for irrigation and stockwatering.</td>
