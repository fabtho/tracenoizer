 In those cases where access to the mineral estate would adversely affect other Forest resource values, the Government can negotiate a settlement with the mineral owner to avoid the impacts. . These are scattered parcels and their precise locations can be found in the Forest Service land status maps maintained in the Forest Supervisors office in Hot Springs and in land status maps for each Ranger District maintained at each Ranger District Office. The mineral owner has the right to access and develop the mineral estate regardless of the management area in which the mineral estate is located and the operating procedures set forth through the Forest Plan. However, in most cases, the title to the mineral estate includes provisions to require the many mineral owners to develop access plans with the Forest Service in accordance with Title 36 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 251.</td>

 California, came up with a formula to determine an exact amount of reserved water. The question here is whether reserved water can be used for purposes other than those stated or implied when the reservation was originally made. Similarly, can the US Forest Service use its reserved water right to preserve instream flows for recreation or aesthetic purposes. The courts have not offered a definitive answer to these questions. .</td>
