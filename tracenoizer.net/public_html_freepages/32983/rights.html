 The right to divert as much water as is necessary to serve the purposes for which the land was withdrawn. Priority date is the date the lands were set aside (generally, the date of statehood in western states).

Reserved rights do not depend upon the diversion of water and putting it to beneficial use; nor are they quantified at the time of creation. On Indian reservations, the basis for quantification generally is practicably irrigable acreage, or PIA.</td>
