In particular, the treatment of different image data sets in multiple combinations with optimum degree of geometric accuracy is required for the exact geographic location of individual ground features, especially in mountainous regions.

Hence, based on many years of research in the field of remote sensing, the Institute for Digital Image Processing of JOANNEUM RESEARCH has developed RSG - the Remote Sensing software package Graz.

 . Cesar Operations Introduction to CESAR The Stephen and Mary Birch Foundation Center for Earth Systems Analysis Research (CESAR) is a computer-based research and instruction facility administered by the Department of Geography. The purpose of the Center is to apply state-of-the-art technology in image processing, remote sensing, geographic information systems, automated cartography and numerical modeling to problems with a spatial dimension. Research conducted by the CESAR is directed at both applied and fundamental problems in fields ranging from biophysical remote sensing to urban planning. This research includes computer-based map and image data processing and spatial simulation modeling as well as field experimentation.</td>

 However, major improvements have been made to simplify use, increase reliability and reduce manpower requirements. All major subsystems of the RSG, including the gravity sensor, electronics and data system, may be controlled remotely via computer modem. Additionally, changes have been made to the design and operation of the instrument which eliminate the need for highly-trained personnel to be present at the remote site in order to set up and operate the instrument. To begin operation, the instrument is first moved to the remote site of operation, set in place and roughly leveled using two micrometers. Next, the cryocooler is inserted into the neck of the dewar.</td>
