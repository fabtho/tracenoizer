 A witty look at scientific goofs, blunders, and fiascoes--from N-rays to cold fusion to the biosphere. Not a glitzy book, but great science from two eminent herpetologists who present the information thoroughly and in understandable terms. An investigative journalist gives the facts behind the headlines in an intriguing book, which is packed with case histories showing the terrifying consequences of an ever-increasing problem. Written by a physics professor, a clear and probing discussion that considers both myth and science. An astronomer as well as an accomplished science popularizer, Goldsmith discusses the discovery of the oldest rock known to humankind and what the find reveals about the possibility of life on Mars.</td>
