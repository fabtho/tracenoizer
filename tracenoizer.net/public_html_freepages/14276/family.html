 Having just retired at age 55, I am planning to visit Europe for the first time in June 2002. Besides spending a day each in Haarlem and Amsterdam during a six-country tour, I hope to spend a few additional days checking out the areas from which my grandparents emigrated to the United States. My maternal grandparents' family (Van Boven) emigrated from Yerseke in Zeeland in 1920 (all except for my mother who as the youngest child "was born in America but made in Holland" according to our in-family joke) so I have leads for that half of my family heritage from aunts and uncles who have long since passed away. However, the Pruiksma side of the family does not know much in the way of particulars. When my great-grandfather's family emigrated in 1895, my paternal grandfather was only 2 years old at the time, and all of his siblings were born later in America.</td>

 All passengers, except numbers 232-235, are shown as intended for the United States. Passengers 232-235 have "St" written in the intent column. This exception includes two members of a five member family, including a three year old child. The handwriting for "St" appears to have been written with a diffrent pen. This may be an odd note added at a later time, rather than a true indication of the country of intent.</td>
