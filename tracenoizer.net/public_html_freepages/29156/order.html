 Secondly, the foreign terminology was at times vague and ambiguous, and it was difficult to find the right turn of phrase in Chinese to convey the fine shades of meaning. In the third place, the involved, complicated sentences in some sutras might have appeared repetitious, but in reality they contained well-developed ideas which were lost in the process of translation. Finally, according to Dao An, the syntax of the foreign language was often the reverse of the Chinese, forcing the translator to straighten out the word order in the Chinese translation before the meaning of the sentence would become comprehensible. Dao An was well-read, and could discern the subtleties of these troublesome passages, and clarify their meanings through his explications, much to the admiration of Kumarajiva. Moreover, Dao An made an attempt to collect as many of the sutras as possible.</td>
