The problem is that one cannot precisely refer to the degree-bound of a polynomial, since for a degree-n polynomial, any integer greater than n is a degree-bound. A standard point-value representation for A and B consists of n point-value pairs for each polynomial. Multiplying these together gives us n point-value pairs, but we need 2n pairs to interpolate a unique polynomial C of degree-bound 2n.">

 Instead, the issue of approximate controllability and strong stabilizability are related to unique continuation properties. These areas have recently seen the use of differential geometric methods to solve some outstanding questions in those fields. As an example, a combination of unique continuation results with the boundary control method has lead to the solution of the inverse problem of determining a metric of a Riemannian manifold (with boundary) from the dynamic Dirichlet-to-Neumann map associated with the wave equation. A natural question to ask if one can determine the metric from this data alone ; this question is at the center of the boundary rigidity problem studied in Riemannian geometry. There are also interesting inverse problems for semilinear elliptic partial differential equations where the uniqueness issue is intimately tied with the geometry of the domain.</td>

 Liu Shaoqi, president of China, spent 44 days in Hunan Province in 1961 investigating the rural situation in the post-Great Leap Forward period. The War of Liberation resulted in the founding of the People's Republic and the capturing of a large number of high ranking Kuomintang generals. How to reform these generals posted a big problem for the Communist leadership. This films reveals how the victorious Communist Party reformed their one-time enemies. Mao Zedong sent many of his comrades to Europe to look for new ideas while he himself stayed to join Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao in organizing the Communist Party, which was later established in Shanghai in 1921.</td>

 Wherever he went on his travels, he had sutras copied for him, or received complimentary copies from his Buddhist friends. This search for sutras made it possible for him to compile A Comprehensive Catalogue of the Sutras, a bibliography of all translations done from the Han Dynasty (25-211) to 374, the first of its kind in the history of Chinese Buddhism. His main problem was finding out the names of the translators, for the ancient copyists often neglected to include this information in the translation. In 379 Dao An was abducted to Chang-an, where he spent the last few years of his life. Dao An was instrumental in getting the Sarvastivadin literature translated into Chinese.</td>
