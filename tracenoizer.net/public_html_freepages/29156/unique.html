 As part of this one needs to determine boundary conditions that will lead to a desired state for the solution of the partial differential equation. The core analytical questions in inverse problems are those of uniqueness and stability, while in control problems the issues are of controllability and stabilizability. Instead, the issue of approximate controllability and strong stabilizability are related to unique continuation properties. These areas have recently seen the use of differential geometric methods to solve some outstanding questions in those fields. As an example, a combination of unique continuation results with the boundary control method has lead to the solution of the inverse problem of determining a metric of a Riemannian manifold (with boundary) from the dynamic Dirichlet-to-Neumann map associated with the wave equation.</td>

 The problem is that one cannot precisely refer to the degree-bound of a polynomial, since for a degree-n polynomial, any integer greater than n is a degree-bound. A standard point-value representation for A and B consists of n point-value pairs for each polynomial. Multiplying these together gives us n point-value pairs, but we need 2n pairs to interpolate a unique polynomial C of degree-bound 2n. '' (Reported by San Skulrattanakulchai, 28 November 2001.
