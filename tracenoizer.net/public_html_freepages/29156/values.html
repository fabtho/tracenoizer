 The summation should run from 1 to k (not from 1 to p). The ordering of positions 1 through i-1 does not affect whether i is greater than all of them, and the value of i does not affect the ordering of positions 1 through i-1. The ordering of the values in positions 1 through i-1 does not affect whether the value in position i is greater than all of them, and the value in position i does not affect the ordering of the values in positions 1 through i-1.
