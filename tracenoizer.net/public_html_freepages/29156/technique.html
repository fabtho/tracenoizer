 Some foreign monks attempted the translation themselves, but more often they solicited the assistance of the Chinese. Often, a foreign monk would explain the text in Chinese, and the Chinese collaborator would write down what he heard. This was the prevailing technique employed during the 3rd and 4th centuries, though it would appear somewhat inadequate by later standards. By the late 4th century, the Chinese monks had become competent enough to handle translation without help from foreign monks. Towards the end of the 4th century when preparations were being made for the translation of the Sarvastivadin canon, Dao An began to bring monks together to form a translation workshop.</td>
