 . These problems arise in many areas such as medical imaging, nondestructive testing, and geophysical prospecting. Control problems in partial differential equations arise from the need to dampen out vibration in a structure using actuators located in accessible regions. As part of this one needs to determine boundary conditions that will lead to a desired state for the solution of the partial differential equation. The core analytical questions in inverse problems are those of uniqueness and stability, while in control problems the issues are of controllability and stabilizability.</td>

 There might have been more works on translation studies and practice written and published but for the unsettled situation of war-torn China in the first half of the century. Scholarly studies on translation practice would only flourish in a more peaceful age yet to come. The number of works published in the three regions of China are 457 (Mainland), 94 (Taiwan), and 83 (Hong Kong) respectively, totaling 634. In the same period, eight works were put out in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Since 1976, scholars on the Mainland have been working with redoubled efforts, turning out more and more studies on translation as well as translation course-books of various kinds.</td>
