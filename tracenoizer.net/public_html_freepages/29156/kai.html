 He survived many years of battle to end the long time division of the Mongol nation, and went on to construct the Mongol Kingdom, which served as a solid foundation for the rise of the Yuan dynasty. The film vividly describes the bloody battle between Chinese Qing navy fleet led by the national hero Deng Shichang and the British invading fleets. In the spring of 1938, General Li Zongren of the KMT army under Chiang Kai-shek led the 5th Army to a bloody victory against the Japanese at the Battle of Tai'erzhuang. This film recreates the atmosphere on the eve of and throughout that fateful battle.
