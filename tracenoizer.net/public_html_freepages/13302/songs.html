 Do you have the "Beatnik" plugin or are you using the IE or AOL Browser. (total Unique site Visitors updated at Midnight Eastern time) Over 1,500 "Unique" visitors a day. If you are using Zone Alarm and are having trouble displaying the Graphics on my site or listening to the songs in the "FREE" area (Zone Alarm does NOT affect the songs in the Members area) then please click on the link below . If you are using the new "ONE" Real Audio player, then you can only hear the songs in the Members area and the Christmas area. This is because the new "ONE" Real Audio player doesn't like my StopThief script and won't play any of the songs in the FREE area.</td>
