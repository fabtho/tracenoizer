 Maybe the sound you heard was as quiet as your cat giving herself a bath with her tongue. Or maybe it was a loud sound, like an ice-cream truck going by. Sounds are everywhere, and you've got two cool parts on your body that let you hear them all - your ears. Your ears are in charge of collecting sounds, processing sounds, and sending sound signals to your brain. And that's not all - your ears also help you keep your balance.</td>

 (total Unique site Visitors updated at Midnight Eastern time) Over 1,500 "Unique" visitors a day. If you are using Zone Alarm and are having trouble displaying the Graphics on my site or listening to the songs in the "FREE" area (Zone Alarm does NOT affect the songs in the Members area) then please click on the link below . If you are using the new "ONE" Real Audio player, then you can only hear the songs in the Members area and the Christmas area. This is because the new "ONE" Real Audio player doesn't like my StopThief script and won't play any of the songs in the FREE area. If you wish to hear the songs in my Free area, then you can hear them with most versions of the Real Audio player except their new "ONE" player.</td>
