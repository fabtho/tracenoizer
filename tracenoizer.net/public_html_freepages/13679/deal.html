 Glen Sather went to two familiar wells to replenish his team in the days and hours before Tuesday's trade deadline -- one he unabashedly still admires and another that he long decried. The former is the Edmonton pipeline he built and maintained for a quarter-century (the one he has tapped to restaff almost his entire coaching, scouting and front-office departments). Just before the deadline, Sather struck a deal with protege Kevin Lowe to acquire potential-laden defenseman Tom Poti and versatile forward Rem Murray at the steep cost of heart-and-soul forward Mike York. The latter is the Madison Square Garden cash stream that has long fooled Rangers GMs into thinking they could buy their way out of winning droughts. Sather used that -- and some nifty poker playing -- to launch Pavel Bure (and a second-round 2002 draft pick) out of Florida for Igor Ulanov, Filip Novak, first- and second-rounders in 2002 and a fourth-rounder in 2003.</td>

 He gets smarter every time Sean Casey signs an autograph or takes a fastball into the gap in left center. He is rocking anxiously to and fro, like that Atlanta pitching coach Leo Mazzone does in the Braves dugout. Griffey won't agree to a multi-year deal with anyone. You'll just pay Junior the gross national product of Sierra Leone. Maybe Junior goes to the Braves and loves it there.</td>

 There's scarcely a trace of the kind of circumspection your garden-variety CEO is accorded. Like most successful fine-dining operators, Yamaguchi encouraged his staff to develop a relationship with customers in an effort to bring them back. Seventeen franchised Roy's are not part of the current deal, though the company has purchased one, in Naples, Fla. It wasn't Yamaguchi's first contact with Outback; he was once its Hawaiian franchisee. In fact, Outback execs had invited Roy's to team up several years ago, to no avail.</td>
