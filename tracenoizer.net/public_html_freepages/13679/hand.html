 Optionally, you can apply constraints and vary the output as explained below. Swapping suits is useful to apply the settings of one suit to two or more. If this option is chosen, you cannot modify the other hand of the same side. If the seed is left blank, the generator will be seeded randomly by an outside source and the deals cannot be reproduced. See also my Bidding Practice Dealer for creating just two hands, and my article on Randomization Techniques if you are interested in how these programs work.</td>
