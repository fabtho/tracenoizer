 ) Our first qualifying run at LIONS resulted in a broken right-side exhaust header, and an unacceptable time. We scrambled to get another header to replace the broken one. (Not so easily done as one might think, in those days. ) After much effort we were finally ready to make our second qualifying pass, the last by anyone that day.

 Only problem is, when fantasy is allowed to snowball over three decades to the point somebody like Billie Sol Estes becomes a bona fide Texas icon - a sort of predecessor to J. Ewing - it's pretty hard for most of us to accept anything else. Which is why Billie Sol's case wasn't helped when he was indicted yet again, just days after his colorful press conference in Jim Norvell's office. RESURRECTION MORNING Stories are rampant about Billie Sol in our area, at least among those old enough to remember. Just last week, a veteran newsman at the Hitchin' Post recalled Billie Sol's amazing business acumen in Pecos and how at one point he even got into selling cemetery plots.</td>
