<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" Lane became business manager of the Athletics in 1961 and later scouted for the Orioles and Brewers. A 5-foot chicken wire fence erected to cut the distance by 20 feet results in 11 HRs in eight games, the opponents getting seven of them. Floyd Baker, an infielder who will play 874 games in the ML, hit his only career HR into "Home Run Lane" on May 4th in an 8-7 loss against Washington. Colavito, an unparalleled fan favorite in Cleveland, will hit 173 HRs before returning to the Tribe on January 20, 1965. Kuenn will be traded to the Giants after one season.">

 Reaching a very small peak only in a photo, we went a little down and then back up to the next higher small peak, only in a photo. . The run started with a long dash through some long park with not too many long looks from The Domingueros. Arriving at a hold check, he could have let off on poor Isabel and ourselves.

 My fondest recollection of Al's first year as a Top Fuel driver was the time when we went out to Long Beach, California, (from our base in D. (Connie had won the Winternationals that year, and was favored to win the Spring meet, too. ) Our first qualifying run at LIONS resulted in a broken right-side exhaust header, and an unacceptable time. We scrambled to get another header to replace the broken one. (Not so easily done as one might think, in those days.</td>
