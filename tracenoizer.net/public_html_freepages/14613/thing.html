 On the flip side, if you take one hundred Canadian dollars out of your bank account at an ATM, you've only set yourself back sixty-three dollars and change at home. Then you walk into the Gap, and everything's priced pretty much the same as at home, but in your head, you can lop a third off of that price. And then you start buying every goddamn thing you see. And it's a good thing, too, because Toronto is chock-full of awesome shoes and vintage dresses. ATMs in college towns do that, but not in New York.</td>

 He e-mailed me not too long ago as a result of seeing some of the letters I wrote to you. He is a former Manchester City Policeman who came to Canada many many moons ago. The funny thing is that he always had the feeling that he knew my name from somewhere each time he saw it, and it turns out that he knew of me from the year I spent in Kitchener, Ontario in the mid-70's, it even turns out we have mutual acquaintances in the form of the family of a boy I coached in football during my stay there. I wonder how many other folks have had similar experiences as a result of your excellent publication. Another letter to you is from Anne Walker, actually, it turns out her name is Anne Fletcher.</td>
