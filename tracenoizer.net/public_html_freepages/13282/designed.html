 NIST continuously monitors the GPS signals from Boulder, Colorado and compares the frequency standard on each satellite to the NIST frequency standard. Commercially available GPS receivers often provide a 1 pulse per second (pps) timing output, and standard frequencies such as 1, 5, and 10 MHz. Properly designed GPS receivers can provide traceability to the national frequency standard maintained by NIST (read more about using GPS for NIST traceability). The archived data available here can be used to support claims of frequency traceability to NIST through the use of GPS, since the frequency uncertainty of each satellite is listed. You can use the archive to quickly check the status of the GPS constellation on any given date.</td>
