 bot is an automated sound robot continuously sending an audio stream from Australia to Austria for the five week duration of the project. g emm a is a new mode of thinking about dispersing audiometric material. This online dissemination device allows web users to download full audio files to burn individual cds. An experiment in interrupting the hegemony of the record and publishing industries, ge mm a puts the power of production back in the hands of the user, in a conxtingent marriage of idealism and pragmatics. To optimise the aural contributions of participating sound artists, r a d i o q u a l i a have activated a fax.</td>

 The Small Bodies Node (SBN) specializes in data concerning asteroids, comets and interplanetary dust. Data Services at this Node SBN on-line data archives, with immediately downloadable catalogs and datasets for New. The SBDB will eventually allow users to identify objects based on observed properties and to retrieve data relevant to specific selected objects. During the first stage of implementation, each online catalog is ingested into the database and the contents made available for display based on object identification. A cross-identification utility is built into the interface, so that only a single ID need be entered to retrieve all available data relevant to the object.</td>
