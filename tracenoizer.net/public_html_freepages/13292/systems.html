 The type of video system the government wanted deployed in the field had to be standards-based and compatible with the IP networking protocol. Ease of use and quick turn-up or power-up times was also a necessity. SOLUTION Amnis Systems MPEG over IP networking products were selected and standardized based on the design, performance, feature-set, and price of the overall system. Each new product generation from Amnis Systems is smaller, higher in performance, and more robust than the prior. These key factors were integral for the military's continued use of Amnis products.</td>
