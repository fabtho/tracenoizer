 Each has a specific portfolio of responsibility, and oversees an aspect of OUSU's work, as well as taking responsibility for the smooth operation of the Student Union generally. They form part of the Executive which also includes twelve part-time, current students, of which at least two are graduate students. The Executive is responsible for the day-to-day management of the Student Union, but ultimate decision-making power rests with OUSU Council. The votes taken in OUSU Council form the policy of the Student Union for five years. Around twelve part-time employees work in the Student Union to fulfil these functions, in the General Office (the main reception area and administrative centre), the Accounts Office (dealing with payments of accounts) and the OUSU Shop (selling cheap stationery and other supplies to students).</td>
