 . Resistance without rebellion, irony without mutiny. Only his stupid bosses and insane co-workers interfere with his goals. Instead, Solomon suggests, we should see the daily annoyances of office culture as symptoms of the way corporations work. He means that Dilbert is a sort of corporate deflector shield that keeps people from seeing the real issues.</td>

 Are you surprised that DILBERT's creator, Scott Adams, actually favors downsizing. Are you suspicious when Xerox uses DILBERT in its employee handbook as an offbeat sugary coating to help the corporate medicine go down. Are you tired of the sweeping portrayal of office workers as lazy idiots. Of the running gags that stay inside the moat of the corporate castle. If you answered yes to any of the above, you'll find Norman Solomon's funny and brazen attack more refreshing than a trip to the water cooler.</td>
