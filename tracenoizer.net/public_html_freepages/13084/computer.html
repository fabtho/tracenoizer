 The last decade did not have a shortage of advice, methods and tools for information security work. But the problem is that the underlying model of information when considering security remains a technocratic one. The CSRC takes a view of information systems as socio-technical in nature and not simply computer systems and our approach to security reflects this. The CSRC was opened in July 1991 to examine information security in a wide range of organisations. The Centre has developed frameworks for understanding security management, which have attracted the attention of specialist conferences and practitioners The Centre targets the Information Systems Academic Community; Social Scientists studying the "information society"; Professionals working in Information Systems and especially IS Security; Lawyers working in the field of computer-related crime and data protection; Policy makers in information security field.</td>
