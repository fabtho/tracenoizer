 For those who don't have access to bison and flex, a second file, graphtal_no_bison_no_flex-1. A more detailed description of the software can be found in the graphtal-1. It uses data files to describe the L-systems and program execution is controlled by a command line. It is capable of simulating all examples presented in The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants up to and including Chapter 5. It is bundled with many examples of L-system plants and kolam patterns, illustrating bracketless, bracketed, and context sensitive features of the language.</td>

 Kurzbeschreibung (englisch) In an interdisciplinary project allergology and computer science in Wuerzburg cooperate in the design and realisation of the ADRIA-package (Allergologist's Diagnostic Retrieval and Information Archive). The existing administrative document flow was mapped into the installation launched for daily routine in 1993. modules for information retrieval on allergens, for hypertext on exposure-data, for the official German drug list (Rote Liste) and case-based rule-sets are integrated step by step. As spin-offs databases of drug- and food-allergies for access throught the WWW and a lexicon on differential diagnosis in dermatology on CD-ROM have been developed.

 The Fellowhsips are available for PhD holders (or equivalent) from all over the world. The laser head is mounted to a robot arm with seven degrees of freedom. The operator can move the head in the 3D space practically free in order to capture the coordinates of data points on the surface of the object to be measured. An open day is going to be arranged soon for everybody interested. Their inaugural lectures are held in January of 2002.</td>
