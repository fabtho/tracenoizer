2 (See bottom for change history) In this paper I would like to bring the attention to an important performance bottleneck in the ld. so currently does a fine job for the things it was designed. The problem is that it wasn't designed for todays Linux Desktop. Slow is a very subjective term, but when it comes to a graphical user interface, things are typically perceived as slow when there is a latency of more than 0. So if I click on a button, it should bring up a window on my screen within 0.</td>

 For KDE we are considering to adopt Corel's sysAPS ( System and Application Print Services). From what I understand this library basically abstracts the access to the underlying printing system and provides access to information about printer-capabilities. It is a rather young project so it should not be a problem to adapt to any specific wishes in the API. It doesn't seem to put any constraints on the contents of the print-stream so you should be able to feed it with postscript as well as any other format. My question is whether GNOME has any ideas in this area, whether sysAPS would be a viable option for GNOME, or whether GNOME is considering other solutions.</td>

 Hence, information security has been transformed from a Cinderella function on the outskirts of managerial concern into a central, high priority issue. The last decade did not have a shortage of advice, methods and tools for information security work. But the problem is that the underlying model of information when considering security remains a technocratic one. The CSRC takes a view of information systems as socio-technical in nature and not simply computer systems and our approach to security reflects this. The CSRC was opened in July 1991 to examine information security in a wide range of organisations.</td>
