Viewing a machine's problem history Viewing a machine's problem history InternetPeriscope enables you to keep a history of the problems a remote host has experienced, helping you to determine if a machine should be replaced or upgraded. It also notifies you in real-time that a machine is having problems, enabling you to fix the problem before it affects your users or customers. Before viewing a machine's problem history, you must first add that machine to the console, and setup monitoring for that machine. To view a host's problem history, right click on that host's icon, move your mouse over the "Monitor" menu item, and click on the "Problem History.">

 Startup Screen This startup screen will work with any Macintosh that is using System 7. x and above that is also equipped with a 640 X 480 or larger color monitor. This item is a bit dated, since most folks now demand more monitor real estate than 640 x 480. ..</td>

 When I saw that I could not get enough on the cart I asked him (and Carl but we did not come to an agreement) to participate. What have you been doing during the last few years since completing SIMIS. Currently I am programming a real-time operating system for different processores (ARM,Mcore,V850,SH2). Someone who may have helped you technically or supported you through your hard work. A big thankyou goes also the Harry Dodgson, with whom I share the Lynx hobby now for over 7 years.</td>

 The reverberation time and the volume of the receiving room can be selected from a list of 9 typical rooms. The calculation of the received signals considers in each case 5 directions of transmission by use of the appropriate binaural head related transfer function. The reverberation is generated from measured impulse responses in real rooms. By convoluting the selected input signal with the impulse response the time signal in the receiving room is obtained. The duration of calculation for a signal length of 20 seconds is about 10 seconds on a 233 MHz-Pentium II-processor.</td>
