 Primary functions have included engineering management, software design management and software commercialization activities. Current design management of operating system technology that includes new core platforms for monitoring, capturing and analyzing text in any form of from any source. New application designs include Cyber Sentinel child protection software; a content-based monitoring system designed to control sexually explicit Internet traffic by alerting parents to potential problems via e-mail. Newly completed designs include software to perform application, file and directory access control, time management and desktop security for personal computers, and software to reinforce Acceptable Use Policies. Founded in 1997, the company is successfully developing new technological solutions to security and safety issues related to on-line accessibility.</td>

 However they are very expensive, non-reusable, and pose significant safety risk if a cell is ruptured in a cave. Rechargeable lithium batteries are available but are also very expensive. To overcome the cost problems with alkaline and lithium, two types of rechargeable batteries are normally used, nickel-cadmium (NiCad) and lead-acid. NiCads work well since they have a flat voltage-discharge curve and low cell-impedance. Thus, NiCads can run high-current bulbs at nearly constant brightness until almost depleted.</td>
