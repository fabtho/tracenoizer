 What is brought into focus is the representation of minority groups in the context of history, contemporary society and the institution of art. These markings demonstrates territories and borderlines as they appear in the social landscape of today. The interventions reflects how public laws and definitions is categorising certain groups in our contemporary culture, displayed as poverty lines or anti-homosexual restrictions. By using cheap and pre-fabricated materials like styrofoam and cardboard, the fragility of the works brings into question the stability in the constructions of our cultural surroundings.
