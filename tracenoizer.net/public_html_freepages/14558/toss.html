He or she then hurries back into the catchers' box, awaiting the next launch. Initially, the toss is set at its slowest rate, but as the student becomes more conditioned, the time rate is decreased. Double Play Drill This drill's purpose is to decrease the time of turning the double play by both getting the ball out of the glove quicker and perfecting the timing between the two players. The Wheeler Dealer is set in front of either the shortstop or second baseman and a catch net set at first base.">
