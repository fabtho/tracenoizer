 The Modern Joan of Arc Nelson Harding, Brooklyn Eagle (1909). The woman suffrage movement was a subject for both satire and support by male cartoonists and a source of inspiration for female cartoonists who broke into the profession at the end of the nineteenth century and first decades of the twentieth. Political cartoons about the suffrage movement depicted specific events but also presented images of male and female roles in society; their dress, demeanor, and characteristics; and the consequences of women's increased political activity. Many of the anti-suffrage cartoons expressed male fears of losing power to women and included images like hen-pecked husbands, "mere men," or crazed or dominant women that are still repeated today. Political cartoons about the suffrage movement drawn by women were usually published in specialized magazines like the Woman's Journal and Woman Voter and did not receive as much circulation as cartoons drawn by men for the mainstream press.</td>
