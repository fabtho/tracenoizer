 Worked for Reverend Dunkin , she did, who was our preacher at the wedding. . He had gold and silver around the house, heaps of it. He stack it on the floor in long rows to count it before he sack it up getting ready to hide it from the soldiers or the stealing bands that rove around the country. Folks heard about the money being buried and after master died some white man get hold of the old slave and try to make it tell where it was buried.</td>

 Some time old Master Bean buy her, that's all I know about it. He come through the war safe enough and live to raise his own son, Dick the Third (I always calls him), who lets me live in this one-room log cabin on his farm, God Bless his soul. The old master's house in Arkansas was a big six-room, two-story place of pine planks, with a porch all around the house. Not far from the big house was a rock building used for the looms; in there they made cloth and thread, and they make it for anybody what come there with cotton or wool. I helped throw the thread in the loom, and I get the dye stuff the walnut bark for black, the post oak bark that mix in with the copperas for yellow, the log-wood mix in with alum for the red-brown colors.</td>
