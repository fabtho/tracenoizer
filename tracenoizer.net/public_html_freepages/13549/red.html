 Our favorite item in the Eskimo Joe's line, is of course, this adorable bean bag set. Joe's thick, furry coat can be opened to reveal his own miniature t-shirt. Buffy's soft fur and big red tongue make him the perfect companion. ..</td>

 I helped around the house for Bill McCracken , then I was with Cornelius and Carline Wright , and when I was freed my Mistress was a Mrs. She treated me the best of all and gave me the first doll I ever had. It was a rag doll with charcoal eyes and red thread worked in for the mouth. When the war ended Mistress O'Neal wanted to take me with her to Richmond, Virginia, but my people wouldn't let me go. I wanted to stay with her, she was so good, and she promised to come back for me when I get older, but she never did.</td>
