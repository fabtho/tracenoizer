 My name is Mark Firestone, and I have had the privilege to visit both Disneyland and Walt Disney World. Being native to Indiana, I get to WDW more than to Disneyland. I have been to WDW a total of 7 times (8 in December, and possibly 9 next summer), and to Disneyland only once (but would like to change that). To compare Disneyland and Walt Disney World is really not fair. Walt Disney World is so much larger than Disneyland, and there are so many other cool things to do other than just the Magic Kingdom.</td>
