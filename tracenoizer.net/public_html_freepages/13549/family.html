 Cash is simultaneously an innovator and a classicist. This is a review of one of the greatest albums ever produced, from any genre, Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison. His wife June and other members of the Carter family sing backup on a few tunes. Having worked most of my twenties in the prison system, this one rings true, so true. You can hear the staff summoning prisoners via the PA system.</td>

 .Microsoft TypographyKris Holmes and Charles BigelowThe Wingdings fonts were designed by Kris Holmes and Charles Bigelow in 1990 and 1991. The fonts were originally named Lucida Icons, Arrows, and Stars to complement the Lucida text font family by the same designers. Renamed, reorganized, and released in 1992 as Microsoft Wingdings(TM), the three fonts provide a harmoniously designed set of icons representing the common components of personal computer systems and the elements of graphical user interfaces. Pointing and indicating are frequent functions in graphical interfaces, so in adition to a wide selection of pointing hands, the Wingdings fonts also offer arrows in careful gradations of weight and different directions and styles.</td>

 When the war ended Mistress O'Neal wanted to take me with her to Richmond, Virginia, but my people wouldn't let me go. I wanted to stay with her, she was so good, and she promised to come back for me when I get older, but she never did. Master Rogers kept all our family together, but my folks have told me about how the slaves was sold. She was to be sold and when the bidding started she grabbed a hatchet, laid her hand on a log and chopped it off. Then she throwed the bleeding hand right in her master's face.</td>
