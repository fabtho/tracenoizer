 Write accessor functions to provide access to TaxonBean members. You can't cast an implementation class to its remote interface, unless you make the implementation class explicitly implement the remote interface (not recommended by the EJB spec). Remember, the implementation class is not necessarily in the same process space as the remote interface. If i use taxon, i don't have access to taxonbean classes not part of the interface. If i use taxonbean, how to cast then to taxon before returning .</td>

 'My daddy is gone, the money is all gone, don't know what me and mama will do. I show you that, but I can't bring back your old daddy; I can't bring back the old master. When I get to thinking about slave days always I remember of the slaves that run away. The old master's hide get all turned around if somebody hit a Negro. He was a new slave, what I mean, they had just bought him and the overseer said the whipping was 'just to break him in.</td>

 Not far from the big house was a rock building used for the looms; in dere dey made cloth and thread and dey make it for anybody what come dere with cotton or wool. I helped throw the thread in the loom and I get the dye stuff; the walnut bark for black, the post oak bark that mixing with the copperas for yellow, the log wood mixing with alum for the red-brown colors. I remember the old slave cabins all just alike setting in a row with a box-elder tree growing in the middle of the yard. The cabins was only one room, without windows, facing the south, with a fireplace in one end. Six of dem cabins fill up the yard, near as I get to it now.</td>
