 'My daddy is gone, the money is all gone, don't know what me and mama will do. I show you that, but I can't bring back your old daddy; I can't bring back the old master. When I get to thinking about slave days always I remember of the slaves that run away. The old master's hide get all turned around if somebody hit a Negro. He was a new slave, what I mean, they had just bought him and the overseer said the whipping was 'just to break him in.</td>

 Iverson wanted to let the other stars put on the show and be the cordial host. Jordan did not want to risk injury in his 13th All-Star Game, just one week before his 39th birthday. "I mean, I was honored just to be in the game and run up and down the court with some of those guys and get a chance to be on the floor with Jason Kidd and Michael Jordan. " Jordan didn't want to play more than 12 minutes, but ended up playing 22 with eight points, four rebounds, three assists and two steals. "It took me about four minutes just to break a sweat," Jordan said.</td>

 for the sake of space, some of this narrative has been deleted at this part, and continuing with the next paragraph) Right after the war, I come to Ft. Another time I live on a patch of ground where folks say "Cherokee Bill" (Crawford Goldsby hanged in 1896 by Judge Parker) had battle with officers of Fourteen Mile Creek. When I get to thinking about slave days I always remember of the slaves that run away. Master Bean had a white overseer, but he didn't allow for no whippings, cept maybe he cuff a young one around it he done something real mean, or maybe sometimes he sell one for the same reason.
