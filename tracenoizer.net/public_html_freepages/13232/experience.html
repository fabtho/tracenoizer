 The symposium will be moderated by Andreas Ruby (D). It is no longer a material object of which one can easily say where it precisely starts or ends. The urban experience is continued in other media and is echoed by other cities. Anyhow the city's continuity is in the first place temporal and not spatial. Spatial continuity as provided by architecture and urban planning seems to be less important than creating a coherent stream of experience in the fusion of movement, brands, faces, conversations and media.</td>

 finding your project on-line make it possible and my life is easyest now. org KR uses the TraceNoizer Clone Engine to clone the databodies of the participants of ART01 one of the largest art fairs in the world taking place annually in basel and then uses them in an installation which is show in basel simulaneously. In this installation, visitors can activate the databodies of several ART Basel -participants, while these data streams in turn trigger acoustic and optical signals, and thus provide a spatial experience. clone data is printed on stickers and dissiminated in basel during the ART01. .</td>

 Phantom Tales, which examines the violence and propaganda that permeated the storybooks of Mengbo's childhood, is the artist's first web-based project. For Phantom Tales Mengbo turns to the Cultural Revolution, creating animations based on two widely-known storybooks and a technical guidebook. In recasting One Silver Dollar, an account by a soldier of the People's Liberation Army of his family's tragic history prior to 1949, Mengbo employs cinematic techniques to turn images appropriated from a static black-and-white picture book into an engaging and dynamic experience. An animation of The Technology of Slides Shows examines a PLA manual for creating animated effects in slide shows. A soundtrack, of found music and sounds, accompanies each piece.</td>
