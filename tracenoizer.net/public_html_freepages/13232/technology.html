Background readings are assigned from sociology of science and technology, sociology of culture, and from a growing interdisciplinary literature on human-computer interaction. These readings will deal with various non-reductionist approaches to the study of music and society (that is, approaches that refuse exclusively formalist or sociological analysis). Specialized knowledge of music theory is not assumed, but students with the appropriate background can work on advanced topics in musicology, analysis, or computer-music system development.">
