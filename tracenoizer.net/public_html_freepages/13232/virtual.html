 With the partners of Westbank Industries and Tactile Technology Knowbotic Research has founded mem_brane, a laboratory for media strategies. . These models are complex dynamic fields, which produce an exchange between virtual agents, poetic machines and interactive visitors. Knowbotic Research outlines technoid events parallel in real and virtual spaces to investigate the experience of the multiple layers of reality. The organization is based in Cologne at the Academy for Media Arts.</td>

 Within the computerized space, isolated groups can therefore be made out. The visitor is represented by a cursor which he or she moves, setting off the reorganization of the sounds. A sound system in virtual reality The visitor is an active part of the whole system. Without spatial dissociation, this visitor is part of the mobile digitized audio environment, the SMDK, designed on the basis of a scientific model. In order to navigate inside this system, the visitor is equipped with a monocular display helmet.</td>
