 How can we harness the power of the web and the strength of numbers in the DLESE community to ensure that the materials in the collection are of highest possible quality. How can we ensure that the collection meets the needs of teachers and learners in hard-to-teach situations (e. urban students with limited access to Nature, place-bound students, visually-impaired students, minorities traditionally underrepresented in science and math). How can we encourage contributions to the library by rewarding resource creators with appropriate academic career recognition. Collections Panel report from Coolfont Meeting (August 1999).</td>
