 This sounds like a keyword-specified query and seems reasonable enough, but is this very obvious search function covered by our existing use cases. What about the more general cases of searching for holdings. I'd suggest that use cases 2-1 (Augment Course), 2-3 (Access datasets), 2-4 (Prepare for Class), and 2-6 (Develop Research paper) cover various types of searches. ..</td>

 The liquid-fuel product is similar to petroleum refinery-produced diesel oil and No. Depending upon the liquid-fuel conversion yield and feedstock moisture content, a high-quality by-product gas is available for sale or supplementary gaseous fuel is needed to sustain the process. The existing research-scale process development unit has an approximate feedstock capacity of 25 pounds per hour. Arizona State University proposes to construct a pilot-scale unit with a feedstock capacity of 10 tons per day. The smallest commercial scale for conversion plants of this type is about 500 tons per day.</td>

 Through its consortium of industrial sponsors and several national laboratories and government agencies, CPAC addresses challenges in monitoring production processes for effective modeling and control. Seborg, University of California, Santa Barbara Automation and process control play a crucial role in making modern industrial plants more efficient and competitive in the international marketplace. His research projects involve a balance of theoretical analysis, process simulation, and experimental applications. McMaster Control Consortium The McMaster Advanced Control Consortium (MACC) promotes and advances process control by bringing together researchers and practitioners for the investigation and application of leading-edge control technology. Measurement and Control Engineering Center MCEC is a joint between the University of Tennessee and Oklahoma State University.</td>
