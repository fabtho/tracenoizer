 The liquid-fuel product is similar to petroleum refinery-produced diesel oil and No. Depending upon the liquid-fuel conversion yield and feedstock moisture content, a high-quality by-product gas is available for sale or supplementary gaseous fuel is needed to sustain the process. The existing research-scale process development unit has an approximate feedstock capacity of 25 pounds per hour. Arizona State University proposes to construct a pilot-scale unit with a feedstock capacity of 10 tons per day. The smallest commercial scale for conversion plants of this type is about 500 tons per day.</td>

 They provide ground truth measurements to assist in the validation of the CERES instrument. They can also compare the surface - and space-based observations to learn more about clouds and climate. NASA's Classroom of the Future The Classroom of the Future (COTF) Program at Wheeling Jesuit University serves as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's ( NASA's) premier research and development center for educational technologies and provides technology-based tools and resources to K-12 schools. NASA Coolspace This site contains one of NASA Goddard's educational outreach programs, "You be the Scientist - Exploring Technology with Satellite Imagery. " The program's goal is to increase interest and aptitude in the sciences by putting high-powered scientific tools into the hands of students.</td>
