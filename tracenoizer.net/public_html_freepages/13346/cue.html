 BMI maintains vast computer databases logging the music composed for past film and television work, which is systematically updated. But the database alone cannot reflect all of the music used in new productions. This gargantuan job is made feasible only by the use of cue sheets. Cue sheets are the primary means by which performing rights organizations track the use of music in films and TV. Without cue sheets, it would be nearly impossible for such composers and publishers to be compensated for their work.</td>

 Throughout the 39 conferences of the UCC in the United States, churches, associations, and conferences cooperate in regions to lend their support to seminaries. This support enables students to receive scholarship, subsidizes faculty salaries, and meets special needs of the schools. The Northwest Ohio Association relates to Chicago, Eden, and United through a program called CUE. On the third Sunday in October, the UCC remembers its seminaries in worship throughout the land. CUE invites each congregation to join with 2,3593 local churches in the CUE region to celebrate our CUE Seminaries - Chicago Theological Seminary United Theological Seminary Eden Theological Seminary Litany to Celebrate CUE Seminaries Copy this to your word processor and use it for devotions or worship.</td>
