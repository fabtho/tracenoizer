 Be aware, however, that if you terminate both the QUEST procedure and the SAS System with the SAS Attention exit after having updated the database, you might have unwritten buffers left in memory. In TSO, you need to allocate a file with at least ten tracks of 3350 disk space (or the equivalent) with the DDname S2KOUTP. If the file is not allocated, you get a warning message (-895-), and any response from SYSTEM 2000 software that exceeds 4096 bytes will be truncated. Ten tracks of 3350 disk space is enough for typical use. If some output cannot be stored on S2KOUTP, message -897- appears, and you will lose some output.</td>

 WSXL is designed to support a variety of user experiences ranging from simple "side by side" presentation to tightly integrated and interacting applications. Service Providers and the Utility Model Increasingly, user-facing business services are being implemented using a Service Provider or Utility-based model. The Service Provider model involves the delivery of software as a service to a large number of customers. In this model, it is necessary to be able to reconfigure the software services, including their presentations and packaging, in a variety of ways to meet the specific requirements for each customer. Moreover, it is essential that this reconfiguration can be performed not only by the service provider, but also by its channel partners, to enable distribution channel differentiation; and they must be able to charge for this reconfiguration as a service in itself.</td>
