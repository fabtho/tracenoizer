 Eventually Peter would dive through the air, and catch Michael just before he could strike the sea, and it was lovely the way he did it; but he always waited till the last moment, and you felt it was his cleverness that interested him and not the saving of human life. Also he was fond of variety, and the sport that engrossed him one moment would suddenly cease to engage him, so there was always the possibility that the next time you fell he would let you go. When playing Follow my Leader, Peter would fly close to the water and touch each shark's tail in passing, just as in the street you may run your finger along an iron railing. They could not follow him in this with much success, so perhaps it was rather like showing off, especially as he kept looking behind to see how many tails they missed. We should have to go on, for we don't know how to stop.</td>

 The monitor does not perform any action on the vehicle by itself but controls the set of running processes at any time. The script monitor consists of two modules, an interpreter and an executer. The interpreter takes a BDL script S and builds the transition (ffi) kill ( and run (ae) tables; . An architecture for realtime reasoning and system control. large systems combine fast acting reactive components with more deliberative cognitive components.</td>
