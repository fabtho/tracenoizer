 If you have a song you'd like me to add to this site, just let me know and I'll be happy to include it here if I can. . Included in these pages are an enormous number of songs that I have led and enjoyed over the years at campfires, as well as a growing number of songs sent to me by my friends all over the world. I have tried very hard to break them down into groups that make some sort of sense, but if you think I've mussed something up, please let me know. However, please note that many of these songs are already published in numerous Guiding song books or elsewhere.</td>

 .com This songbook was created for everyone who has ever been involved in Scouting. It is a compilation of songs that are popular at Tanah Keeta Scout Reservation and other camps around the country. There are action songs to keep you moving, American standards to fill you with patriotism, and Boy Scout songs and Girl Scout Songs that have been sung by Scouts for generations. If you are currently a Scout or Scouter, I hope that your visit here will inspire you with new songs for your meeting, camping trip, or summer camp visit.</td>
