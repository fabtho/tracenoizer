 This is pop before it was bastardized by teenage girls and Frisbie (The Marbles are another such band) are tapping into its glorious stream. Hailing from Chicago, Frisbie have been making some noise around the city's venues and radio stations. Top tapping melodies, Wilsonesque harmonies (It's not possible to review this band without referring to The Beach Boys) and overall, a sound so pretty it doesn't belong to this decade. Also engaging are Martha, a heartfelt croonfest and To See and To be Seen, a tuneful throwback to the 60s. The Shuffle, a banjo led album closer sounds like the Hillbilly Beatles.</td>
