 It is important that security vigilance not be reduced after January 1, because the potential for computer security incidents does not decline after January 1, 2000. Also keep in mind that not all Y2K failures (if any) will necessarily occur at midnight, your local time, during the rollover to January 1, 2000. For organizations that have interdependent systems that span multiple time zones, some failures may begin to occur hours earlier (or later) than the time of the rollover in your local time zone. Also, be aware that different computer systems' internal clocks may represent their time information in different ways (local time vs. Internet industry, academia, and government participants have been working for some time to deal with Internet Y2K problems.</td>

 We seek to foster a sense of urgency at all levels local, national and global, while helping the public and the media understand and prepare for the impact of the Y2k problem. Finally, we urge government and business leaders to step up to this challenge and provide leadership, education, and prevention. Please see our documents on Embedded Systems and Synergistic Mitigation and Contingency Preparation (offsite). See also our Correspondence with the New York Times. Journalists, policy makers and professionals should look in Rumor Central.</td>
