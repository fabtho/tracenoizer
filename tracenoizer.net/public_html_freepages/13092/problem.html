I read the archive and saw, that someone has already mentioned this, but there were no replies, and the seriousness of the problem was not made clear. What I would like to know is, if anyone has a fix to this problem, which we've experienced both at the experimental BSCW server at GMD, and our local server here in Aalborg. The problem is quite serious, as it virtually inhibits the use of versions.</td>
