 Since the summer of 2001 the CAN pages are hosted by the University of Nijmegen. . Stichting Computer Algebra Nederland Stichting Computer Algebra Nederland About CAN CAN, Computer Algebra Nederland, is a foundation established in 1988 stimulating and coordinating the use of computer algebra (systems) in education and research. The number of computer algebra specialists and users in the Netherlands is limited and they are scattered over several disciplines, each having its own scientific and organizational traditions. An additional goal of CAN is to provide specialists and users with a common platform for discussing problems of mutual interest.</td>

Common Causes for Computer System ProblemsThis probably does not refer to your situation, but I have found that many times when a user thinks that his system is 'bad' or has 'gone bad' the fault is electrical or magnetic in nature, at the customer's site. very often caused by peripherals such as laser printers that use a ceramic fusing process, that are not isolated from the rest of the system.</td>

 Beowulf Cluster System Problems We experienced a problem where non-priviliged users were not able to fork any processes. We have exhaustively checked what tuneable parameters there are that could have caused this. We had to reboot the front end computer (this host). When the computer was rebooted the running jobs on the compute nodes were not 'seen' by the the PBS server. This made it necessary to reboot the compute nodes to clean up those jobs.</td>
