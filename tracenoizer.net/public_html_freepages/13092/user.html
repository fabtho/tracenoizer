 Current projects are examining the construction of dynamic user models and user category-level classification using fuzzy logic as well as user modeling through associative neural networks. .USER Lab The User System Environment Research (USER) Laboratory, which is under the direction of Dr. Norcio, studies intelligent and adaptive interaction environments for enhancing the effectiveness of computer users. The User lab houses a high-end 486 machine with a Verbex Voice Recognition System, two Mac System, two Mac 840 AV machines with speech recognition and multimedia capabilities, and a Unix-based NeXT machine as well as a SparcStation 2.</td>

 . Our charter is to develop new techniques for people to interact with large information environments. On the one hand, we have computer scientists working on new user interface paradigms; on the other hand, we have cognitive scientists working on the technical analysis of human behavior in information environments. We are interested in augmenting human cognition to assist them in their tasks. We also work on novel graphical user interface techniques such as 3D and 2D information visualization and large format displays.</td>

 Bioprocessing Research Facility Description The Bioprocessing Research Facility (BRF) includes laboratories for the investigation of advanced bioprocessing concepts using stirred-tank and columnar bioreactors and a fermentation pilot plant for large-scale batch and columnar experiments. Other research and support laboratories are available on-site. Research Opportunities The BRF provides the user with state-of-the-art equipment. Stirred-tank and advanced colunar bioreactors are available ranging in size from benchscale to 500L. The large fermentors have been approved for use with nonhazardous recombinant microbes.</td>
