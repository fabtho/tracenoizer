 . Stichting Computer Algebra Nederland Stichting Computer Algebra Nederland About CAN CAN, Computer Algebra Nederland, is a foundation established in 1988 stimulating and coordinating the use of computer algebra (systems) in education and research. The number of computer algebra specialists and users in the Netherlands is limited and they are scattered over several disciplines, each having its own scientific and organizational traditions. An additional goal of CAN is to provide specialists and users with a common platform for discussing problems of mutual interest. A lot of historic material can be found by following the links to old CAN pages CAN diensten Since 1995 the commercial activities of CAN are concentrated in an independent company, CAN-diensten, specializing in software for mathematics and statistiscs.</td>
