 . Leonard Adleman of the University of Southern California in the US and colleagues used different strands of DNA to represent the 20 variables in their problem, which could be the most complex task ever solved without a conventional computer. The researchers believe that the complexity of the structure of biological molecules could allow DNA computers to outperform their electronic counterparts in future (R Braich et al 2002 Science to appear). Scientists have previously used DNA computers to crack computational problems with up to nine variables, which involves selecting the correct answer from 512 possible solutions. But now Adleman's team has shown that a similar technique can solve a problem with 20 variables, which has 220 - or 1 048 576 - possible solutions.</td>

 The second source was the ideas and experiences that derived from the problems in the internal corporate use of computer technology for communication and worksharing. The distributed nature of Lunatech and most companies offers communicational challenges that can be greatly aided by modern computer communications. Specifications for a general client Computers are a tool to aid humans in obtaining their goals. Computers are amongst other tasks good at holding, ordering and providing access to information. Most information processed in a personal computer in the future will come from a source lying outside the system.</td>
