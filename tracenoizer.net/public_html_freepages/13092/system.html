 . Mac Virus Home Page MacCentral Finder Errors, Bombs, Bus Errors etc. System Extension Conflicts - If the errors do not seem to be linked to a particular application or occur on start up then it is possible that two or more system extensions are conflicting. If your system does not start up correctly you will have to switch all the extensions off by holding down the Shift key during the inital startup process (You should see a message "Extensions Off on the "Welcome to Macintosh" Startup screen. If the machine correctly starts without the extensions then you can use the process above to turn on extensions untill the problem starts again.</td>

Common Causes for Computer System ProblemsThis probably does not refer to your situation, but I have found that many times when a user thinks that his system is 'bad' or has 'gone bad' the fault is electrical or magnetic in nature, at the customer's site. very often caused by peripherals such as laser printers that use a ceramic fusing process, that are not isolated from the rest of the system. How knowledgeable are the sales people in these places.</td>
