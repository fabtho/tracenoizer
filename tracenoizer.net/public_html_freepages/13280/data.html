 Briefings and Documentation Here you will find a number of COE Data Engineering briefings and documentation for online viewing and downloading. . DoD Data Emporium Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) is responsible for data services and other data-related infrastructure that promote interoperability and software reuse in the secure, reliable, and massively networked environment planned for DoD's Global Information Grid (GIG). Reference Data Sets This data product is designed to facilitate the reuse of reference data tables that are highly sharable in DoD systems. Developers are encouraged to use these tables that are in simple ASCII files to support data interoperability, integration, and promote cost savings.</td>

You can also drag Data Environment objects onto forms or reports to create data-bound controls. Create hierarchies of commands based on a grouping of Command objects, or by relating one or more Command objects together.</td>

 Instead of stove-pipe organizations dealing with data of uncertain pedigree, consistency, and timeliness, everyone across your enterprise can have access to the best and most recent information. . IGS Integrated Data Environment (IDE) Home Back to Solutions Solutions Profiles Integrated Data Environment (IDE) Configure your data for life cycle support Intergraph can help you develop an integrated data environment (IDE) that captures and reuses product data across the enterprise and throughout the product life cycle. Instead of leaving data locked in disconnected legacy systems, partner with Intergraph to realize the full potential of your most sizable investment - the knowledge locked in your information systems. Supporting large, complex, products with long life cycles is extraordinarily complicated.</td>
