 "I cannot see any use for Pavulon," Mark Heath, a New York anesthesiologist, said in a hearing on the constitutionality of lethal injection. " Heath, who also teaches at Columbia University and has conducted research for the National Institutes of Health, was an expert witness called by defense attorneys for Michael Wade Nance, who could be sentenced to die if he is convicted of a 1997 Gwinnett County murder. The hearing is the first in Georgia, and only the third in the nation, in which a judge has taken testimony on the humanity of lethal injection. This hearing sets the stage for the issue of the constitutionality of the method Georgia adopted last October to go to the Georgia Supreme Court. " Scott Stallings, spokesman for the Department of Corrections, which carries out the state's executions, said in an interview the procedure had already been tested in several other states and it has "worked well in Georgia.</td>

 Bloom, Nashville, Tennessee, for Appellant Sharon S. Sarli (now Kelly) against George Leroy Evans, III, wherein she sought a determination that he was the father of her child. Evans stipulated that he was indeed the father of the child, the Referee and the Juvenile Judge made various determinations relative to custody, child support and the like. Kelly, being dissatisfied with a number of the determinations in the Referee's last order which on appeal was in the main affirmed by the Juvenile Judge, filed this appeal. We vacate the judgment of the Juvenile Court and remand the case for further proceedings.</td>

 In this case, the plaintiff sued for benefits following the death of her husband, the employee. The trial court found that the employee was exerting himself, but that there was no causal connection between the exertion and his death. This Panel has concluded that the trial judge was incorrect in finding that the exertion was not linked to the employee's death. We find that death or disability arises out of and in the course of employment when the exertion of the employee's work causes the heart attack, or aggravates a preexisting condition. It makes no difference that the employee suffered from a preexisting heart disease or that the attack resulted from ordinary exertion of the employee's work.</td>
