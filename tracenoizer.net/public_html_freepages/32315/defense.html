 In an execution carried out two months later, a 2nd dose of drugs had to be administered to 348-pound police killer Ronald Keith Spivey, Duffey testified. Georgia's execution protocol mirrors the plan followed in South Carolina and doesn't take into account an inmate's size or possible allergies to medications, Duffey said during a hearing on the constitutionality of lethal injections. Gwinnett County Superior Court Judge Michael Clark is the first judge in Georgia to consider evidence on the issue since the state switched to lethal injection in October, defense attorney Mike Mears said. Mears is asking Clark to declare lethal injection unconstitutional. Regardless of how Clark rules, his decision will enable the case to be appealed.</td>

The Panel vacates the trial court's judgment and remands the case for a new trial in which the new standard will be applied.
