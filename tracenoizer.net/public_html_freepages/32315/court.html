The employee contends that the trial court erred in finding that the employee's conduct amounted to a willful failure or refusal to use a safety appliance pursuant to Tenn. To clarify this area of workers' compensation law, the panel adopts a new standard which requires the employer to prove four elements in order to make out the affirmative defense of willful failure or refusal to use a safety appliance.</td>

 In an execution carried out two months later, a 2nd dose of drugs had to be administered to 348-pound police killer Ronald Keith Spivey, Duffey testified. Georgia's execution protocol mirrors the plan followed in South Carolina and doesn't take into account an inmate's size or possible allergies to medications, Duffey said during a hearing on the constitutionality of lethal injections. Gwinnett County Superior Court Judge Michael Clark is the first judge in Georgia to consider evidence on the issue since the state switched to lethal injection in October, defense attorney Mike Mears said. Mears is asking Clark to declare lethal injection unconstitutional. Regardless of how Clark rules, his decision will enable the case to be appealed.</td>

 " Heath, who also teaches at Columbia University and has conducted research for the National Institutes of Health, was an expert witness called by defense attorneys for Michael Wade Nance, who could be sentenced to die if he is convicted of a 1997 Gwinnett County murder. The hearing is the first in Georgia, and only the third in the nation, in which a judge has taken testimony on the humanity of lethal injection. This hearing sets the stage for the issue of the constitutionality of the method Georgia adopted last October to go to the Georgia Supreme Court. " Scott Stallings, spokesman for the Department of Corrections, which carries out the state's executions, said in an interview the procedure had already been tested in several other states and it has "worked well in Georgia. " Since the Georgia Supreme Court declared electrocution cruel and unusual punishment last fall, the state has carried out six lethal injections.</td>
