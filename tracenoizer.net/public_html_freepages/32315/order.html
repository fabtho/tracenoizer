The employee contends that the trial court erred in finding that the employee's conduct amounted to a willful failure or refusal to use a safety appliance pursuant to Tenn. To clarify this area of workers' compensation law, the panel adopts a new standard which requires the employer to prove four elements in order to make out the affirmative defense of willful failure or refusal to use a safety appliance. The Panel vacates the trial court's judgment and remands the case for a new trial in which the new standard will be applied.

 Trust funds managed by the Citadel Development Office whose annual proceeds are designated for the support of the Chapter appear to show great promise. Proceeds are dependent on the investment income of the fund. ASCE Trust Fund - This Fund was instituted by the Civil Engineering Class of 1991 in order to provide a source of funds to later chapters. The rate of growth of this Fund has been slowed by budgetary restriction and it is unlikely that it will be vested (that is, that it will be able to provide chapter funding) prior to 2005. Until now, the difference between being a Student Chapter in name only and assuring a beneficial professional experience has depended on the continuing generosity of the engineering community, alumni and friends of the Civil Engineering Department.</td>

 Rubenstein and Mears are with the Multi-County Public Defenders Office, a state-funded agency that helps defend suspects in death penalty cases. Both are assisting Gwinnett lawyers in arguing to spare the life of convicted murderer Michael Wade Nance, 39. Nance robbed a Lilburn bank and fatally shot a motorist in order to hijack a getaway car in December 1993. An appellate court affirmed Nance's 1997 conviction but overturned his death sentence because a juror had a pro-death-penalty stance. Mears, a death penalty authority, told Clark that if lethal injections continue, an auditor should monitor the executions and ensure that the procedure is as painless as possible.</td>
