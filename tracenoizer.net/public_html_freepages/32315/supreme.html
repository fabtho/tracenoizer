 Curtis Moore, now 34, declined to be interviewed from Death Row in the prison system's Polunksy Unit in Livingston. On Tuesday, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals rejected a petition by Moore's lawyer that the execution be halted so tests can determine whether the condemned man is mentally retarded. Supreme Court is expected to rule on a case in Virginia on whether executing someone who is retarded violates the prohibition on cruel and inhuman punishment. He noted that test scores from Moore's youth showed him with an IQ ranging from 68 to 76. Many experts say the cutoff for mental retardation is an IQ ranging from 65 to 70.</td>
