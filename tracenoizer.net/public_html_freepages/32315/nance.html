Rubenstein and Mears are with the Multi-County Public Defenders Office, a state-funded agency that helps defend suspects in death penalty cases. Both are assisting Gwinnett lawyers in arguing to spare the life of convicted murderer Michael Wade Nance, 39.

An appellate court affirmed Nance's 1997 conviction but overturned his death sentence because a juror had a pro-death-penalty stance.</td>
