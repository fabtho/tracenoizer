 To any family members who view this, please do not take this in a bad way, it would just be impossible to list all of my relatives who have passed away here, there are far to many. . I love the people I have found in my biological family, but I am and always will be a Haydon, my life and values are a product of the people who raised and loved me. The people who watched me grow and learn, change, and become the person I am today. I am saddened by the fact that so many of those who I loved are gone.</td>

 Edmund and his brother Richard were the sons of Edmund GOODE, Sr. I descend from Edmund's son, John GOODE who married Anne M. Please contact me if you have any information on the family. She lived in the Lynchburg area until approximately 1861, when she and her husband and two sons left for Ohio. Her father's name was Claiborne GLADMAN, and I believe her mother's name was Anna RIFQUE or RISQUE.</td>
