 Children will reuse trash items to create new objects and decide new uses for unwanted items. Children will use the terms reuse and reduce as they further their understanding of how they can take responsibility for the Earth. Students will then address trash issues in their own classrooms. They will generate solutions for handling their class trash that demonstrate their awareness of how they can help care for the Earth. They will then use the decision-making process to design and construct a social setting - a recycling center.</td>
