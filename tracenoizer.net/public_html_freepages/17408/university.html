 Observational astronomy is another area of his expertise. Boice has been a visiting astronomer at Kitt Peak National Observatory (NOAO) where he obtained echelle spectra for his dissertation using the Mayall 4-meter telescope, Arecibo Observatory (NAIC) where he was co-discoverer of a radio flare on a late-type giant star (alpha Ceti), and Sacramento Peak Observatory (NOAO) where he observed solar plage spectra and Ellerman bombs on the Tower telescope and sunspots in white light. He has also made photometric and spectroscopic observations on smaller instruments at Blue Mesa Observatory (NMSU) and Brigham Young University. Boice has taught several undergraduate classes in astronomy and mathematics at NMSU, University of Texas at San Antonio, and San Antonio College. He helped to design the activities that are currently being used in the astronomy laboratory classes at NMSU and he has mentored high school students for the past three years under the NSF-sponsored YES program.</td>
