 Evidence of successful cloning and overexpression of this protein in E. Krantzman, College of Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina 29424-0001 and B. Garrison, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802 The use of polyatomic projectiles in organic secondary ion mass spectrometry has attracted a lot of attention because of the nonlinear enhancement in secondary ion yield that these projectiles produce. Our group has been conducting molecular dynamics simulations in order to better understand the mechanism behind such enhancements. We use radial plots from the impact point of the energy density distribution for each trajectory to explore a correlation to the yield.</td>
