 Since the game punishes the player for greediness, recklessness and cowardliness it was considered a good training for life, and was played by rulers and samurais in Japan of the last centuries. Hooked players, mind you, believe life is merely a good preparation for Go. The rules are very simple, but the strategy and tactics that follow are extremely complex, too complex for a computer to play reasonably. Another exciting possibility is to play Go using the internet. Using Go servers such as IGS and NNGS, you can play with anyone around the globe, even top professionals (if your lucky).</td>
