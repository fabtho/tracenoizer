<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" The lady who organized it said she'll email me the pictures whenever she gets them off her digital camera. It's really fun restoring wetlands, I think I'd like to do it more often, maybe I'll see if there are any groups that do that stuff full-time around here. I was also thinking that the last thing I want to get a job in is retail or food service, so maybe manual labor would be more fun. You'd get nights off too, since you can't do much planting at night. No homework for the rest of the weekend, so maybe I'll find something fun to do tonight.">

 " Click here to see the Ultimate Thrill Ride of the Kodak Previews. ) Click here to see more Kodak previews with Isaac Asimov's ROBOTS and Yo-Yo. You've probably noticed that Dig Dug still isn't an olympic event, and there's not really such a thing as the World Video Game Championships. I think he got that title when his right hand beat his left hand in the great Skip Rogers World Video Game Championship he held in his living room. Skip might as well call himself Secretary General of Games or Captain Retarded the Master of Nintendo Disaster.</td>

 But Catholic religion is all doings and no feeling in the heart. ""Aunt Lorendo, when you were a Catholic did you always confess everything to the priest. ""Yes, ma'am; I'd tell the priest every thing I did wicked. The priest told my cousin's marster about it, and they was talking strong about hanging my cousin. They had my cousin up and made him tell who had told him any thing about freedom.</td>

 But Rogers says he will still try to reach and teach children through his Web site. And at the end of his final show, Rogers promises viewers -- just as he does at the end of every other show -- that he will be back. It's what he's done for hundreds of episodes, so why mess with a good thing. Rogers, 73, has been doing what he wants for years. His slow-paced show is an alternate universe to most of today's quick-edit cartoon children's programming.</td>
