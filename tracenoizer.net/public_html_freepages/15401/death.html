CORU has devised a 'Variable Life Adjusted Display' or VLAD which takes account of inherent risks of peri-operative death associated with risk factors such as age, left ventricular function and type and urgency of procedure. A surgeon is regarded as being notionally in credit or debit according to how his actual peri-operative death rate compares with the death rate that would have been expected based on risk forecasts.
