 It's not like there aren't already loads of sites doing just that, but thankfully some online art sites are going much further and using the actual medium itself to create new forms of art or offer new ways of looking at traditional art. You follow them to look for new disciplines that share qualities with those you already like, or to open up new worlds of arts and culture. The huge range of contemporary artists means you could spend weeks exploring the pathways associated with them, and get an awful lot of pleasure and understanding from doing so. As you can probably tell, I loved it; it's something only the Web can do, and it's a million miles away from e-commerce sites. The site also offers good books, recommendations and the best worldwide arts calendar I've found.</td>

Black-and-white illustrations throughout, 8 pages of color.</td>
