<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" It is hoped that the research outcomes will lead to the development and promotion of guidelines for meeting equity objectives with extension reforms. The approach is effective in conserving agrobiodiversity on-farm and providing choice to farmers on genetic materials. Furthermore, the approach is cost effective as compared to conventional breeding approach in terms of time and resources required to develop and disseminate any new genetic material in the community. However, the limitation of the approach is lack of trained manpower to implement the approach in wider scale to have any visible impact. To this effect, CARE Nepal has shown interest on the subject and LI-BIRD has been identified as resource institution to impart training of CARE Nepal field staff on the concepts and methodologies of PVS and PPB.">

 Professor Schluter was accompanied in this survey by the Deputy Project Leader of ITECO Nepal and five teachers of graduate students from the Department of Geology of Tribhuvan University. During this initial phase, the Nepalese geologists were trained in identifying and mapping Quarternary deposits' morphological and sedimentological features with specific stress on glacial-like samples. Material samples were collected and morphometrical assessments carried out on sample particles to identify the origin of the sediments. Twenty-one electrical soundings were carried out on thick fragile, glacial-like deposits. In addition, morphometrical and petrographical studies were conducted on the 36 samples collected, as well as grain size analyses on 16 of these samples.</td>
