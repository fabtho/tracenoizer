Summer You may have noticed the coolness of parks and wooded areas compared to the temperature of nearby city streets. Shading and evapotranspiration (the process by which a plant actively moves and releases water vapor) from trees can reduce surrounding air temperatures as much as 9 degrees F (5 degrees C). Because cool air settles near the ground, air temperatures directly under trees can be as much as 25 degrees F (14 degrees C) cooler than air temperatures above nearby blacktop. Studies by the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory found summer daytime air temperatures to be 3 degrees F to 6 degrees F (2 degrees C to 3 degrees C) cooler in tree- shaded neighborhoods than in treeless areas.">

" Cool Roofs Making a building reflective reduces the amount of solar heat it absorbs. Vegetation Trees reduce cooling energy use in buildings by shading them and cooling the air.</td>

 In addition, temperate lakes stratify during the summer because of water's temperature-dependent density. The heat of the summer substantially raises the temperature of the upper water layers. As water temperatures increase, the density decreases. Thus, sun-warmed water will remain at the surface of the water body (forming the epilimnion), while the more dense, cooler water settles at the bottom (hypolimnion). The layer of rapid temperature change separating the two layers is called the thermocline (Smith, 1990).</td>

 Therefore, temperature exerts a major influence on the biological activity and growth of aquatic organisms. To a point, the higher the water temperature, the greater the biological activity. As temperatures get too far above or below this preferred range, the number of individuals of the species decreases until finally there are few, or none. For example, we would generally not expect to find a thriving trout fishery in ponds or shallow lakes because the water is too warm throughout the ice-free season. Temperature is also important because of its influence on water chemistry.</td>
