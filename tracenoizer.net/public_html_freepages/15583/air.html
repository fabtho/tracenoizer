 Cuts energy waste and prevents air related control problems by improving water distribution and system balance. . Spirovent radiant heat air remover from Northeast Radiant Heat - The Radiant Heat Experts Home About N. SPIROVENT removes ALL AIR, including entrained microbubbles, from hydronic heating and cooling systems by means of an air absorption and patented screening process. Stationary air trapped in coils, radiators, deadend risers, or down-curved piping is first absorbed to facilitate further air elimination.</td>

 It's a key to understanding weather because latent heat is a major source of energy for thunderstorms and hurricanes as well as being a factor in any process involving water, such as the formation of snow crystals. The graphic above shows what happens during evaporation - the phase change from liquid to vapor. Fast-moving air molecules in warm air collide with liquid water molecules. The water could be falling rain drops or in a pond or a bowl. The collision transfers energy from the air molecules to the water molecules.</td>
