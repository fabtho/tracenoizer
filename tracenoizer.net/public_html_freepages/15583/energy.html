 . Electric air-source heat pumps use the difference between indoor and outdoor air temperatures to heat and cool inside air. What can ENERGY STAR labeled electric air-source heat pumps save me. Which manufacturers make ENERGY STAR labeled electric air-source heat pumps. The technical specification for this product has been revised and will become effective October 1, 2002.</td>

 Another graphic explains more about the three phases of water. . It's a key to understanding weather because latent heat is a major source of energy for thunderstorms and hurricanes as well as being a factor in any process involving water, such as the formation of snow crystals. The graphic above shows what happens during evaporation - the phase change from liquid to vapor. Fast-moving air molecules in warm air collide with liquid water molecules.</td>

 . However, heat pumps generally do not perform well over extended periods of sub-freezing temperatures. The cooling performance of heat pumps, like that of central air conditioners, is rated as a Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (SEER). This is the cooling output divided by the power input for an average U. Heating performance is measured by the Heating Season Performance Factor (HSPF), a ratio of the estimated seasonal heating output divided by the seasonal power consumption for an average U.</td>
