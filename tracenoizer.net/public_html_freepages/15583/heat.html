 The ACEEE publication "The Most Energy Efficient Appliances 2001" offers a more extensive list of efficient appliances. . However, heat pumps generally do not perform well over extended periods of sub-freezing temperatures. The cooling performance of heat pumps, like that of central air conditioners, is rated as a Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (SEER). This is the cooling output divided by the power input for an average U.</td>
