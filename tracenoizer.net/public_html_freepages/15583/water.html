 Surface tension is responsible for capillary action, which allows water (and its dissolved substances) to move through the roots of plants and through the tiny blood vessels in our bodies. . What are the physical and chemical properties of water that make it so unique and necessary for living things. When you look at water, taste and smell it - well, what could be more boring. Pure water is virtually colorless and has no taste or smell.</td>

 Information on this page is from A Primer on Water Quality, by Swanson, H. . Geological Survey has been measuring water for decades. Millions of measurements and analyses have been made. Some measurements are taken almost every time water is sampled and investigated, no matter where in the U.</td>

 . Many thermal pollution problems are a result of anthropogenic activities (see "sources"). However, some water quality problems occur because of natural temperature fluctuations. The following information is provided to explain why temperature affects water quality and how anthropogenic activities may enhance the negative effects of natural temperature changes. First, water possesses many important thermal qualities.</td>
