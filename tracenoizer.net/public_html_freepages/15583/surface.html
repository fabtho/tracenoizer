Links The Surface Temperatures of the Planets The Sun's Energy. The factors that determine the temperature are a complex balance between the amount of heat received and that lost. The heat received by a planet varies with its distance from the Sun, for it is the Sun's radiation which is by far the greatest source of planetary warming.</td>

 As seawater increases 5 ppt in salinity, the freezing point decreases by 0. The ocean can be divided into three vertical zones, depending on temperature. The top layer is the surface layer, or mixed layer. This layer is the most easily influenced with solar energy (the sun's heat), wind and rain. Here the water temperature drops as the depth increases.</td>

 Back to all thermometers Back to my home page -o- Back to my Pluto page Marc W. . Temperature of Pluto Surface Temperature of Pluto A B C D E F G These thermometers show different temperatures that you might be familiar with plus some you might not know. The scale for the thermometers is on an absolute scale. The bottom corresponds to absolute zero (0 degrees Kelvin, -273 degrees Centigrade, or -469 degrees Farenheit).</td>
