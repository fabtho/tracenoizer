Cueing System and Developmental Reading Continuum LANGUAGE ARTS - READING Page Contents The Reading Cueing Systems Developmental Reading Continuum Return to TOC THE READING CUEING SYSTEMS Students come to school with portions of the three reading cueing systems in place, depending upon the richness and diversity of their life and language experiences. Teachers need to identify the additional skills and strategies students need to make reading meaningful. The proficient reader uses three major cueing systems in making sense of text.</td>

 Opinions expressed are those of the authors and not necessarily those of the National Science Foundation. . Project CUES (Constructing Understandings of Earth Systems) will be comprehensive in its treatment of earth and space content standards of the National Science Education Standards (NSES) and feature innovative approaches to helping students to develop understandings of earth systems concepts, scientific inquiry, and nature of science. Improve instruction by acting as a tool to facilitate professional development. Motivate all students to continue their study of science in higher grades.</td>

 In the research program summarized here, I propose to develop and test an initial theory of cue integration for spoken language interfaces. Although several studies have shown relationships between pairs of various potential cues, none have attempted to study more complex interactions. Furthermore, these findings have not been applied to working systems. Current systems rely primarily on lexicalization to signal speaker intention, with the context of the preceding utterance providing additional constraints (e. We lack computational models for understanding pause cues in spontaneous speech, however; existing systems simply ignore pause.</td>
