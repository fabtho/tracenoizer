 The chairs are arranged in a circular formation that allows everyone to see and hear what they need to in order to reach a decision. After the introductions (this takes about an hour) comes the mingling part. For the next 45 minutes to an hour, you move around the room checking out (and being checked out by) potential dates. As you stop and chat with various men, you may add some numbers to your list, or you may take some off. The aim is to find out what you have in common, and the well-lit room avoids a meat-rack atmosphere.</td>
