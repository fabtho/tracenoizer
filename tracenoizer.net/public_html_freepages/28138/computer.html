 How do you bring up the subject of your HIV status. Enter Date Bait, where the old-fashioned mixer meets modern technology to help men make what it calls social and romantic connections in an open and nonthreatening environment. You'll be given a tag with your name and a three-digit ID number to wear, a clipboard and pencil, and a computer card that looks like a lottery ticket. No pre-registration is required, but it's a good idea to get there a bit early; space is limited to 80 participants, and it fills up fast. You take your seat along with all the others, and a moderator explains the procedure.</td>
