As young Jews try to piece their lives back together, many are dating more seriously and more frequently than before.

 The team first wanted to see what the patterns were. Because our monitors had only four colors, they looked at the triangle modulo 4. When they had a program that worked, we had to let it run all night in order to get the picture we wanted.

This picture stayed in my mind for years, and it eventually led to some research of my own.</td>
