 But no matter what your occupation, you will find in this book a comforting and compelling reminder that each of us has something vital we can contribute to a better world. As the story of Elizabeth Evans Baker shows, we need only search inside for it. Guided by a passionate response to the earth's natural beauty and to the arts which translate and embody the human spirit, here was a finely attuned integrity that could focus and rally and inspire the necessary work for peace in which any creativity, social and artistic, must be grounded. Readers receive both an excellent biography of Baker and a focus on the establishment of peace studies in higher education. The latter is especially important as few books have examined this process.</td>

 Risemberg, the Jewish-focused Date Bait events have a higher-than-average match rate. A matchmaking session in January at Manhattan's B'nai Jeshurun congregation scored the highest number of matches at any one Date Bait event -- 139 matches in one night. Risemberg is something of a statistics-happy social scientist, he does not keep tabs on the prospective couples once the evening is over.
