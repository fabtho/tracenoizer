 I found the book both educational and entertaining. Whether you are interested in the history of Dracula, or are just looking for a good book, I cannot recommend this one highly enough. This is an impressive piece of historical fiction - well researched and well told. While Vlad Dracula is certainly a famous, or infamous, historical figure, not a lot has been written about his world. Augustyn does a very good job of introducing the average history buff, such as myself, to the region and time.</td>

 After the meal he had them locked up in the sheds in which they had eaten, and burned them all. He felt they were eating the people's food for nothing and could not repay it. Although there is some uncertainty about its historical accuracy, Vlad is believed to have been buried at the Snagov monastery. "His headless body was buried at Snagiv, near Bucharest, but tales persisted that the grave was empty, Vlad having risen. " 3 Vlad's reputation grew even larger when historians and scholars began to speculate that Bram Stoker used the historical figure of the Impaler as the basis for the main character in his novel, Dracula.</td>
