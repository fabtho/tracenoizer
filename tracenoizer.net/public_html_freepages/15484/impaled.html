 The Wrath of Vlad TepesIn the spring of 1459, Vlad committed his first major act of revenge. On Easter Sunday, the boyer famillies were arrested. All of the old boyers were impaled, and the rest of the boyers were ordered to build a new outpost overlooking the Arges River. After the castle was built, Vlad impaled these boyers as well. While eating his lunch, Vlad was seen gathering blood from the impaled victims, dipping his bread in the cups of blood, and eating the bread.</td>

He would have the impaled victims placed in various geometric patterns. Typically they were placed in concentric circles around the city that they were from for all to see. He used high and low speared according to the rank of the individual.</td>
