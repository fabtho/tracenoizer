 The contact with the Ottoman world is dour but it gives him the opportunity of finding out the Ottoman organization, habits and military technics and of learning the Turkish language. In 1443 he comes back to his throne, but his two sons Vlad and Radu are still kept hostages until 1448, when their father is killed. The name of Vlad Dracula is connected to the day of 8 February 1431, when his father, Vlad I, was invested by the Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund of Luxemburg with the Order of Dragon ( Ordinis Draconis ) for having protected the catholicism against the Turcs. It consisted in badges and two flags with a cross on them; at ceremonies the Dragon knights used to wear red suits and a green silk mantie and, on Fridays, they were dressed in black. The necklace they had at their necks was made of two chains joint by a cross that would uphold a dragon; on the length of the cross was written " O quam misericors est Deus " (" Oh, how merciful God is ") and on its breadth was written " Pius et justus " (" Kind and just ").</td>
