 Sound has been one of the primary areas of innovation and experimentation within art and technology culture, with practitioners quickly embracing new forms of production and exhibition. Advances in scientific areas such as algorithmic and chaos driven approaches to sound composition have profoundly shifted the field of experimental sound art. Sampling and digital technology detonated the remix bomb, causing a fusion of styles, methods and origins. Audio in digital media contexts has become a field of unlimited transmutations and unheard potentials. Recent developments in the delivery of audio across the Internet have also lead to the mass distribution of music online.</td>
