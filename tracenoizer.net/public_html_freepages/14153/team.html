 Anyhow, hopefully all my sub-pages will be up soon. I have a rugby movie I'd like to put on this site for everyone to download, but I have to zip it first. Played by two teams, players on each team try and score by either kicking, passing or carrying the ball until they can kick it over the opponents goal or touch it behind their opponents goal line. The team who scores most is the winner of the match. However, if someone has to teach me how to zip a file so i can update it into angelfire's cgi-bin first.</td>
