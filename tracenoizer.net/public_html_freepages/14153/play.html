 Some of his performances showed a lack of commitment to Cardiff Rugby Club which has frustrated and appalled those of us on the terraces. Although his start promised much as he played with heart during the European Cup, since then his performances have been embarrassingly bad, happy to get through the game without being injured and just kicking his kicks. His tactical awareness is abysmal (but we all knew that before he arrived), his skill base suspect and his positional play poor. Tactically - he lost us our ground record this s eason with some bewildering decision-making - he's not only confused supporters with his suicidal run-it-from-deep tactics (best excemplified by the disaster in Montferrand), he's also confused his team mates. What we thought were pre-planned tactics (and we have this on excellent authority) have turned out to be purely his decisions.</td>
