 That's why I'm pleading with them today to do EVERYTHING to hold on to their up-and-coming stars. I'm talking about three in particular - Michael Owen, Ceri Sweeney and Robert Sidoli - and I've every reason to believe that with talent like this on tap, Ponty will get over the loss of Lee Jarvis. Sweeney is a fantastic prospect at fly-half and was one of the stars of the Wales development tour last summer The 21-year-old is a really exciting talent and showed what a tough customer he was in the Ponty side that lost 21-14 at the Arms Park. He has fought his way into the Wales Under-21 side this season and, hopefully, with Jarvis leaving he will get the chance to prove his worth next season at Sardis Road. Welsh rugby's very own Michael Owen looks like a top star in the making at No 8.</td>

 Currently second on the all-time point-scoring table with 838 points behind retired Wallaby pivot Michael Lynagh (911 points), any indiscretions by opposing teams are sure to be punished. . Rugby Heaven - wales Index Choose a team Argentina Australia Canada England Fiji France Ireland Italy Japan Namibia New Zealand Romania Scotland South Africa Spain Tonga Uruguay USA Wales W Samoa Groundswell for change growing in Britain Delusions among the Home Unions remain in some quarters after all four teams were dismissed by the quarter-final stage of the World Cup, but many are now talking about the defeats as the catalyst for adopting new structures and competitions to make a serious assault on the 2003 tournament. South still rules, bitter north concedes The British press was in a sombre mood on Monday as it reflected on the southern hemisphere's continued dominance of world rugby and Jannie de Beer's virtuoso performance with the boot. Referee decisions sour atmosphere It was injury time, and Wales were badly in need of some real magic.</td>
