 September 8, 1999 - Saint Anselm College Athletics A GOOD OMEN. - HAWKS DOWN PANTHER NEMESIS, 3-1 PLYMOUTH, NH (Sep. Throughout the long series history of men's soccer between Saint Anselm and Plymouth State College, it has almost always been the Panthers who remained standing with the win after each annual meeting. Even last season, the greatest in Hawks history, Saint Anselm's 18-2-1 record included a blemish against none other than Plymouth State. But that long standing frustration came to a new end this afternoon as Kevin White (North Dighton, MA) booted home two goals and sophomore Chris Bagley (Holbrook, MA) added the eventual game winner early in the second half and the Hawks nipped the Panthers 3-1 at Plymouth.</td>

 Lapchick Special for the Sports Business Journal Notre Dame may have cracked one of sports toughest racial barriers by hiring Tyrone Willingham as its head football coach on New Year's Day. While there have been a handful of other African-American head coaches in college football, this is sports' most segregated major position. And Notre Dame is the most storied program in the history of the game. Athletics Director Kevin White inherited a university program that had no African-American head coach in any sport. If he was, then his first offer would not have been to George O'Leary.</td>
