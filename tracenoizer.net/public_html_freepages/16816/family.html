 . Descent from John Burns and Mary Dempsey to Philip Robert Burns Descent from John Burns and Mary Dempsey to Philip Robert Burns These are my direct Burns ancestors back to John Burns and his wife Mary Dempsey of Shanagolden, County Limerick, Ireland (see map of Ireland). If you know anything about this branch of the Burns family, particularly about ancestors before John, please send me email and let me know. This cottage is now used as a tool shed by the members of the Burns family still living on the property. Burns family farm showing the newer dwelling built in this century.</td>

 The idea for this being to possibly find missing puzzle pieces that fit or answer questions occurring throughout the lines. The exact number of children at this time stands at either 14 or 15. Hopefully, many serious researchers of this family will forward their documented research to me for placement on this site. Full credit will be given for all information recorded in this research project. Please do not extract or copy from this site for personal or economic gain, place the contents on any other web page or in any publication, or link to any site without the explicit approval of Ms.</td>
