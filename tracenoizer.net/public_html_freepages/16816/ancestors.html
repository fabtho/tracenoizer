 This house is quite a bit more spacious than the earlier cottage. . Descent from John Burns and Mary Dempsey to Philip Robert Burns Descent from John Burns and Mary Dempsey to Philip Robert Burns These are my direct Burns ancestors back to John Burns and his wife Mary Dempsey of Shanagolden, County Limerick, Ireland (see map of Ireland). If you know anything about this branch of the Burns family, particularly about ancestors before John, please send me email and let me know. This cottage is now used as a tool shed by the members of the Burns family still living on the property.</td>
