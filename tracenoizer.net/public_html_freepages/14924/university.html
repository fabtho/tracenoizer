 From time to time, CIRCL may have an opportunity to hire graduate student researchers. . The CENTER FOR INJURY RESEARCH AND CONTROL (CIRCL) at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center is an interdisciplinary, comprehensive program involving six schools and 18 departments of the University of Pittsburgh. The Center conducts injury control research, gathers and disseminates information on injuries, provides training for health care professionals, and informs the public and community leaders on injury control measures. In September 1995 it became one of 10 centers in the country to receive official designation as an Injury Control Research Center by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</td>
