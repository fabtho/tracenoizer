 The easing of access to antibiotics will contribute to the continuing onslaught of the bacterial world and will lead to the emergence and spread of multiresistant bacteria. Allowing over the counter antibiotic access would not only increase unnecessary antibiotic use, but also result in patients inadvertently exacerbating the resistance problem by failing to follow the required regimens. Over the counter use would not allow for the provider education needed to encourage appropriate consumer use. Whenever bacteria are exposed to subtherapeutic levels of an antimicrobial drug, they tend to develop protective mechanisms in order to survive. Major medical associations and several regulatory groups are acknowledging antibiotic resistance as public health crisis.</td>
