 Bach's frequent tours had procured his reputation as the greatest organist of his time. He was able to understand and use every resource of musical language that was available in the baroque era. Bach married twice and had 21 children, ten of whom died in infancy. The next year he married Anna Magdalena Wilkens, who was a soprano singer. Bach's sight began to fail in the last year of his life.</td>

 The journey from New York to Pomeroy took a day longer than our entire ocean voyage of 21 days. A few of us got out in Cleveland and traveled on in various directions. Some of these men have already died, while others are still alive. A few of them went to the country and became farmers. The cobbler Adam Reitz, the mason Johann Lentz, Jacob Schwarz and I remained in Pomeroy.</td>
