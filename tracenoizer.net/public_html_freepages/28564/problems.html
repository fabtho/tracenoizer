 There is a growing gap between rich and poor The Shanghai Daily reported that in some parts of China loans are now being limited to students from the very poorest families. But analysts have warned that this could exclude some students who genuinely need the loans, making it hard for them to afford to study at university. Problems with loan repayments are common in China where consumer credit is a relatively new phenomenon. Yet many students are thought to have struggled to repay their loans simply because of the rising costs of studying. State media say education fees are soaring as government policies force universities to generate more of their own income, and banks have also been criticised for making the application procedures for student loans too complex.</td>
