 The Chinese Government says it wants to promote higher education in order to help boost the country's economy, yet critics say the authorities are still not investing enough in education, and they say student loans will not solve the problem. . The Shanghai Daily newspaper said the problem was so bad that a special national database would be set up to track students' credit worthiness. Officials complain that some students are using bank loans to buy expensive jewellery for their girlfriends Special low interest education loans were introduced three years ago to help poor Chinese students cope with rising education costs. But some students have found them hard to repay, while others have reportedly exploited the system to fund expensive lifestyles.</td>
