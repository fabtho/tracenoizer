 His most prestigious acknowledgment to date was Nicholls State University's decision to name their new culinary program in his honor. The Chef John Folse Culinary Institute at Nicholls State in Thibodaux, Louisiana, offers Associate and Bachelor of Science Degrees in Culinary Arts. Folse's cookbook is the first of its kind to tell the 250-year old history of Cajun and Creole cuisine. Chef Folse provides the history behind each dish and method of preparation, adding depth to the inherent traditions of the Cajuns or Creoles who created them. Featuring 200 of the most traditional of Louisiana's Cajun and Creole dishes in their original uncut versions, along with those same recipes on facing pages in the modified version, this book is for everyone.</td>

 Many Migwetches to Jonathan, who prefers that his last name not be used. This person, who is of Grand Portage Ojibwe heritage, had lost touch with his ancestral origins. He found some relevant info on this site, about Grand Portage and other Minnesota Ojibwe tribes and history that helped him and his kids get in touch with their Indian roots. He saw the problems I'd been having since the fire with hardware to replace not covered by insurance. That's a really helpful kind of giveaway, an Indian tradition.</td>
