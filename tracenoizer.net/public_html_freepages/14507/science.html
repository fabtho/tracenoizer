 Teaching My teaching in biochemistry has included courses in 'Bioenergetics' at the 4th. year undergraduate level and in 'Proteins and Enzymes'for biochemists at the 3rd. But I am now developing my broader interests in the social and historical aspects of science. Some time ago I examined William Walwyn's contributions to politics and medicine in the 17th. In the January-April and September-December terms at Brock University I shall be teaching a course in "Human Sociobiology".</td>

 New Data, Typographical Errors, Factual Corrections . . 1988 The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction, with Peter Nicholls. But here, the text is written by Clute, which alone is enough to bring it head and shoulders above other coffee table fare. SF is a genre mainly of words, less of pictures, so the 'illustrated' part is dominated by photographs of book covers and authors.</td>
