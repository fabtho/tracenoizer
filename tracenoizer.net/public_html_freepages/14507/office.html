As it prepares for the challenges and opportunities of a new century, Virginia Tech will continue to look to the generosity of donors to help support its land-grant mission of teaching, research, and public service. The Office of University Development is the fundraising arm of Virginia Tech. Gifts can be designated to a specific college or area or they can be unrestricted, which provides the university with the resources to meet its priority needs.
