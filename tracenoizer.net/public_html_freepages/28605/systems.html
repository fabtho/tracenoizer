 School of Natural Resources at the University of Missouri-Columbia Copyright (C) 1999 Joint Astronomy Centre All Rights Reserved. We advocate an integrated scientific approach to natural resources management. 1) Cooperation and collaboration of several specific disciplines are necessary to deal with natural resource management problems to assure sustainability of resources and the systems in which they exist; 2) Management decisions should be focused at the ecosystem level; 3) Environmental, social and cultural factors must be considered in natural resource management decision making. Students from The School of Natural Resources in various class settings. Explore this site to learn more about our programs.</td>
