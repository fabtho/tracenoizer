 , each book must be in subject 1 AND subject 2 AND . .

Recognizing this need, the National Science Foundation funded a College Faculty Workshop on Environmental Management, that was conducted at Utah State University in July and August 1996. The principle objectives of the seminar were (1) to provide a meaningful course which would generate new ideas and innovative educational approaches in the emerging field of environmental management, and (2) to develop an applications-oriented problem workbook which would support undergraduate faculty involvement in the production of course materials.</td>
