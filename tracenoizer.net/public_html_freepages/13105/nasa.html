 The EOS Project Science Office (EOSPSO) is committed to helping bring program information and resources to program scientists and the general public alike. Terra Satellite Data Confirm Unusually Warm, Dry U. Winter April 8 - New maps of land surface temperature and snow cover produced by NASA's Terra satellite show this year's winter was warmer than last year's, and the snow line stayed farther north than normal. NASA Pinpoints Where Rain Comes from and Where It Goes April 1 - A new NASA computer model can now tell exactly where in the world rain or snow that provides local water originated. China Dust Disaster Imaged by NASA Spacecraft March 29 - Dust covered northern China earlier this week during some of the worst dust storms to hit the region in a decade.</td>
