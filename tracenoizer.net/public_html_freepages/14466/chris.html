 Behavioural Ecology and Sociobiology 19, 143-150 Full publication list JOHNSON, Christopher N. . Chris Johnson Dr Chris Johnson Reader Dr Chris Johnson Dr Chris Johnson is an ecologist with interests primarily in macroecology, evolutionary ecology and conservation biology, and he works mainly on marsupials. We know that rarity predisposes species to extinction, but there is increasing evidence that the risk of extinction is unevenly distributed over the phylogenies of higher taxa. Is this because rare species are non-randomly distributed over phylogenies.</td>
