 More recently we have installed an Aviv 202 circular dichroism spectrometer with a prototype stopped-flow system. This uses a four syringe stepper motor configuration allowing single or double mixing. We have a commercially manufactured temperature jump instrument from DiaLog as well as a pressure jump instrument built to a design of Professor Freddie Gutfreund at the University of Bristol. Click here for access to practical tips on kinetic data collection and analysis. Circular dichroism (the difference in absorption of left and right circularly polarized light) is used to follow changes in the chirality of molecules.</td>
