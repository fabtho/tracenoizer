 . Jacques Ellul Jacques Ellul, Christian Anarchist Jacques Ellul, is primarily known as a Theologian. However, in 1988 he published a book entitled Anarchie et Christianisme, made available in the U. Eerdmans Publishing Company, Grand Rapids, Michigan. In this book, Ellul lays out his definition and understanding of Anarchism, and explains why he admires the likes of Bakunin and the 1880-1900 Anarcho-Syndicalists.</td>
