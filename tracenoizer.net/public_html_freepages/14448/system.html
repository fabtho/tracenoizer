 Contact Information For information, the beer game, bibliography of System Dynamics, or older back issues of our journal please contact Roberta L. . In fact it has been used to address practically every sort of feedback system. While the word system has been applied to all sorts of situations, feedback is the differentiating descriptor here. Feedback refers to the situation of X affecting Y and Y in turn affecting X perhaps through a chain of causes and effects.</td>

 But it is the flimsiest make-believe to pretend that vocational guidance is in the service of human beings. . problematizing vocational education Education in the Ellul's The Technological Society "If we really wished to take into consideration only the individual's aptitudes, we would have to tailor the economic system to them. The obvious impossibility of such a system demonstrates that is is senseless to apply the rule of the primacy of the individual and that vocational guidance cannot be isolated from the other techniques" (Ellul 360). "Vocational guidance then has the task of adapting the individual, through education, to planned manpower requirements" (Ellul 360).</td>
