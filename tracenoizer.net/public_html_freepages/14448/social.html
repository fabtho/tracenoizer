 Constitution and the powers granted therein to Congress. Congress can only possess powers which are contained, expressly or by necessary implication, within the text of the Constitution, particularly Art. Being straightforward and to the point, the problem here for Social Security is that no particular clause in this or any other article of the Constitution is sufficient to sustain such power to compel a domestic American to participate in a compulsory retirement or benefits scheme. The power to thus mandate participation in Social Security must therefore be one which is based upon an implied power. Can Congress assume this inherent power of the State and claim it as its own.</td>

 Second, nature itself is a difficult, slippery, contentious concept that has largely gone unexplored by sociology. Asking how nature can be operationally defined and plugged into a regression formula is hardly the best approach to this problem, but at least it problematizes nature, and that is an essential step in making nature matter to the discipline. Indeed, Murphy sees the social construction of nature as the arch enemy of a naturalized sociology, rather than a potentially helpful approach to resolving social conflict over environmental issues. Nature, Murphy argues, is an absolute, and we know nature through an ecological science that presents to us a true and undeniable picture of the environment. At times Murphy equivocates, acknowledging that science is a politically charged undertaking that is influenced by a variety of social forces.</td>

 . It has been said that no book, other than the Bible, has had a greater affect on society than Darwin's On the Origin of Species. Darwin himself seemed to approve of the application of his evolutionary ideas to moral and social issues. It did not occur to me formerly that my views could be extended to such widely different and most important subjects. One of the most insidious features of Darwin's evolutionary speculation was that it sought to erase the fundamental differences between man and animals.</td>
