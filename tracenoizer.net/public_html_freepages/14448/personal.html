 Part of my course work involved advanced exegesis, greek language studies and a great deal of other things. It was a fantastic experience for three reasons, One, some of the people I met today are among my closest friends to this day. Two, I had a teacher named Doug Farrow (who set insanely high academic standards) take personal interest in me and mentor me. He now teaches at McGill as Professor of Theology and I am deeply indebted to him to this day for his care, rigor and charisma. My goal is to use the questions as a platform for him to open up and share a measure of his life, values and experiences with us so that we can better understand who he is.</td>
