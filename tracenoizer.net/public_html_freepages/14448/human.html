 PDF) Here is some advice about writing reports for the lab. . In general, we use mechanics principles to try to understand better various aspects of human and robotic motion-- locomotion in particular. Indirectly related research has been on the mechanics of collisions. Several Graduate Students work or have recently worked in the lab.</td>

 CHARLES KNIGHT is President of the Commonwealth Institute. This article was orginally published by Social Policy, Fall 1988, pp. Lewontin, in his work as a population geneticist, has challenged the very concept of race in the human species. The biological evidence, he says, is of much more genetic variation within the racial populations than between them. From this perspective, Jensen's work becomes meaningless as it was based on separating IQ test subjects into the conventional racial groupings and comparing scores to arrive at a proof of genetically based difference in racial IQs.</td>
