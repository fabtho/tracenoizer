 Ubi Soft's colorful platformer sprawls over 18 levels in four environments. Within a level, Donald must track down three Energy Spheres, then find the Gyro-Gamma-Tubal-Teleport, which will warp him to the next level. Magic Books give a timed twist to standard collect-and-go fare. When Donald opens a Magic Book, he simultaneously charges the nearest Energy Sphere and starts a timer. Donald must then find the Energy Sphere before its energy runs out.</td>

 The best period probably runs from the beginning to the late 40s. The introduction of Daisy particularly is a real masterpiece of comic art. Most or all of these strips up to December 1950 were published in Italy in 4 giant hardcover books ("Paperino mille e 92 strips", "Paperino - 1072 Paperinate in tempi di autarchia", "Paperino - Un triennio di strips D. Regular chronological editions were published in Norway, Denmark and Sweden as well. In the USA, Gladstone reprinted the first few years in the comic-book "Donald Duck".</td>
