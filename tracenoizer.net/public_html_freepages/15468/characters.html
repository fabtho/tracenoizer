 Most of the one-line descriptions of the characters are from Fredrik Ekman, back from when he edited the list of Disney characters with translations into lots of languages. . Disney Comics Characters Disney Comics Characters The English names of the characters are used here. From the character pages you can find the translations into other languages, from a database of translations. Hopefully this will make it easier to find the character you are looking for (even if you don't know the name), but be aware that these "universes" often mix with each other, so you might find Grandma Duck in a Mouse story or Tinker Bell in a Duck story.</td>

 'Al Wallaah' is one of his interesting novels that deals with social and political issues at various levels. The main character, Farah, a naive and shy seventeen-year-old, learns about the truth after a long struggle with himself and the people surrounding him. The characters and the events in his novels represent a picture of real life that could ring true for any reader. Farah's character, for instance, is a pattern that represents the adolescent boy in the Arab world, who faces many choices in life and develops his own independent personality. Hamarneh explains in her book that Minah's job was to "speak up for ordinary people, who live in poverty, the simple people who have very few outlets to express their points of view.</td>
