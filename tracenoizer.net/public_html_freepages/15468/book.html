Hamarneh writes in the introduction the reason behind writing about Minah, with his distinguished language and his ability to use spoken and classical Arabic in his novels. "Minah does not hesitate to use colloquial terms and expressions in his work in order to maintain a high level of realism," writes Hamarneh.</td>

 Within a level, Donald must track down three Energy Spheres, then find the Gyro-Gamma-Tubal-Teleport, which will warp him to the next level. Magic Books give a timed twist to standard collect-and-go fare. When Donald opens a Magic Book, he simultaneously charges the nearest Energy Sphere and starts a timer. Donald must then find the Energy Sphere before its energy runs out. The action begins on the lush slopes of Duckie Mountain before entering the mean streets of Duckburg.</td>
