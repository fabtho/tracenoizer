 . Memorial Page - Canine Liver Disease Memorial Page - Canine Liver Disease This page is dedicated to our sweet dogs who have gone to the Rainbow Bridge due to liver disease. Chelsey was Susan's once in a lifetime dog and Susan will forever miss the love that they shared for each other. The hoop and harness that Chelsey is wearing was to help guide her as she was going blind; it helps guide the dog so they don't bump into things and hurt themselves. Susan is a member of the canine liver list, senior dog list, blind dog list and petdiabetes list, all for her special little Angel Chelsey.</td>

 Before entering Miss North Dakota USA, I would've had no idea where and how to start in the entertainment world. Again I'm am so happy and honored to hold this title. I love representing my little town of Riverdale, I love representing this great state, and I'm so excited I finally get my year as Miss North Dakota USA 2002. I would love to hear from anyone who checks out this website. .</td>
