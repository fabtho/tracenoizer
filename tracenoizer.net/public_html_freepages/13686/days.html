<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" They require a certain amount of heat to develop from one point in their life-cycle to another; from seeding to the 4-leaf stage. Due to the lack of better information and for convenience, the calendar is often used to predict plant development and subsequent management decisions. Calendar days can be misleading, especially for early crop growth stages. For example, a cool May can greatly delay the calendar date required to reach the 4-leaf stage, affecting optimal weed control tactics. Conversely, two weeks of hotter than normal weather in July can advance lentils from green pod to harvest-ready, meaning you should have had the combine in the field three days ago.">

 . My mom said to me the other day whenever I told her my new name for my little boy, "isn't your husband going to have any say in your kids names. nope guess not" Then a few days later I heard this really good line and I thought it was pretty funny. I can't remember where I heard it now but pretty much the mother was naming her kids and not letting their father have any say and she said to that "yeah, I told him he can name all the kids he has and I'll name the ones I have. Us girls are the ones that have to go through all the pain having the things.</td>

 Several years ago one of my Ed Tech classmates in a graduate program was from Louisianna. He got a head football job there, and we kept in touch by e-mail. A few days before one of their state playoff games he told me the game time temperature was supposed to be in the 50's and he was going to get a heavy coat and long underwear. Heck, our coaches are still wearing shorts in that kind of weather. North Dakotans have the last cookout before it gets cold.</td>
