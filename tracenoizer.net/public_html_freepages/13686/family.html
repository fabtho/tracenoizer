 Susan is a member of the canine liver list, senior dog list, blind dog list and petdiabetes list, all for her special little Angel Chelsey. She is also a member of the k9 epilepsy list for Sherlock. She had a family here, including 2 other huskies, neither of which were her puppies. In under one week, she was at the vets 3 times, the last being an emergency vet where she was put to sleep, so she wouldn't suffer. She lived a happy life, where she loved her stuffed animals and her treats.</td>

 Ultimately, all human languages could conceivably be traced back to a single origin, and this has been seriously proposed. "A basic tenet of Nostratics is that Western comparative linguists, in classifying the world's languages and thus tracing their historical lineage, have been too timid . According to classic Nostratic doctrine, the Indo-European language family is only one of six branches of a much larger family. The idea is that all these languages are offshoots of the proto-Nostratic tongue, spoken by a people who lived more than 10,000 years ago. Nostraticists, through the arcane detective work that is a primary pastime of comparative linguistics, have reconstructed this language.</td>
