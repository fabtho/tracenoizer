 Distribution of these titles, and those by some other publishers, is explicitly prohibited by the current copyright owners. You will not find these games available from any site (or published on compilation CDs) that cares about Sinclair emulation. During this revision, several sites previously listed in the FAQ, some emulators, and many new sites were identified that included denied software (or links to download it) These have been removed and will not be relisted or included under any circumstances until the links or titles are removed. Do not ask for them to be added; a list has been created and and is checked periodically - when the files have been removed or the distribution status of the titles available changes, these sites will be incorporated in the FAQ. I have the game I want, but it's in the wrong format.</td>
