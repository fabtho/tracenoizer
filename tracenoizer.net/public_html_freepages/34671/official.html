 . 4, 2002 Broadcaster's basement living brings national journalism honor story and photo by Amy Moerke, BSJ05 Forced to spend the majority of his time in the basement of Annie May Swift Hall in 2001, Ben Adler (BSJ03) produced a piece on the death of Rashidi Wheeler that earned him a top honor from the Society of Professional Journalists. Ben Adler had been talking sports since he was 8 years old, muting out the official television sportscasters and doing his own play-by-play of major league baseball games. Most of his time is spent working in the WNUR newsroom in the basement of Annie May Swift Hall. Living in the basement, however, can be good news for a reporter.</td>
