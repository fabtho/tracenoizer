 How can we develop diesel engines that are more environmentally friendly. Did you ever wonder how the earth's magnetic field is generated. These ideas are being explored at the University of Maryland's Institute for Research in Electronics and Applied Physics (IREAP). Experimental and theoretical research and computer simulation are pursued in IREAP by 57 research scientists. Faculty members affiliated with IREAP are drawn from a variety of disciplines including electrical engineering, materials and nuclear engineering, mathematics, meteorology and physics.</td>
