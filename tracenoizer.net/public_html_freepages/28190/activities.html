 It must be possible to link with others within the colony, to communicate easily with workers outside the Marsville structure and also to talk to Mission Control on Earth. Methods of communication that work on Earth may not function in the same manner under the conditions of Mars. This communication team will need to co-ordinate, manage and monitor arriving and departing spacecraft, exploration activities on the planet and communications with Earth. Spacecraft from Earth will be bringing supplies, other crew members and equipment. These craft will need to be guided to the colony and given directions during landings and departure.</td>
