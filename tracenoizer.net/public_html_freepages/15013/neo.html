We'll all be fortunate if what we see is as kinetically entertaining as The Matrix. The story begins as mild-mannered software engineer Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) -- alias hacker-for-hire Neo -- begins to suspect that something is strange in his world. He has been contacted by a mysterious woman named Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) on behalf of infamous hacker Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), and has become the target of shadowy agents led by Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving). If that description seems a bit coy, it's only because part of the fun in the first half of The Matrix is allowing its bizarre cosmology to unfold.">
