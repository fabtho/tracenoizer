 Back to the home page Back to the top of the page Q1 How are the books sorted. - The genealogies are sorted by the surname of the main or the first family mentioned in the title. The book The History of the Peterson, Smith and Glenn Families would be under Peterson. Regional history will be sorted by state and further sorted by the subject of the book. For example if you are looking for a book on Pontiac Illinois, which is in Livingston County, it would be listed under the P's in the Illinois section.</td>
