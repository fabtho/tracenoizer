 In the upcoming months I will be greatly expanding the Tick content to include page art, sketches, alternate covers and character designs, as well as more covers and Circus Maximus portraits. The Runners section is devoted to the space adventure series I am currently working on. Currently the section consists of the entire 7-page short story I originally did for the Small Press Expo Anthology 2000. Also please feel free to e-mail me with any comments and suggestions. .</td>
