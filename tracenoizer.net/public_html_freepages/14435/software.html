 Using The Windows Application Compatibility Mode When you use Windows Application Compatibility mode, many of the most common issues that prohibit earlier versions of programs from working correctly are resolved. If you run a program and it does not function as expected, it is recommended that you run the program in one of the compatibility environments. For More Information For additional information about software that is compatible with Windows XP please visit the Windows 2000 Check Hardware and Software Compatibility Web site. For information about how to obtain and install the Application Compatibility Toolkit 2. 0, visit the MSDN Windows Application Compatibility Web site.</td>

 Although encryption of data during transactions provides crucial confidentiality, integrity, and authentication, these attributes make up only a small portion of the security that must be ensured for e-commerce. Businesses engaging in electronic commerce incur greater risk of attack, greater risk of severe losses, and a greater loss-to-incident ratio than if they simply put up Web pages. In fact, due to the complex nature of business, e-businesses are much more vulnerable than simple Web sites due to the greater complexity of the software necessary to support e-commerce transactions. The software that executes on either end of the transaction -- server-side or client-side software -- poses real threats to the security and privacy of all e-commerce transactions. Encryption protocols generally provide the strongest perceived security in all the components involved in e-commerce transactions.</td>

 However, it is also possible to tailor an individual application for a specific script system or set of scripts, or for a specific regional variation of the system script or other script. To do so may require installing a new script system or a modified set of resources to replace those of a currently installed script system. (This is especially true if your target region is not already supported by a localized version of system software. ) Either way usually involves modifying the System file. The Apple Computer system software licensing policy forbids shipping a modified System file, so you cannot install your replacement resources in a System file and ship it with your application.</td>
