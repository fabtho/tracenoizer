However, it is also possible to tailor an individual application for a specific script system or set of scripts, or for a specific regional variation of the system script or other script.

 The primary benefit of this script was concrete reinforcement of the initial exposure to concepts students had through lecture and textbook. . Experience with the Logic Module Script Experience with the Logic Module Script The script for the Theorem-Proving Modules was used in the laboratory section of the undergraduate introductory AI course at Temple University during the Fall Semester, 1993. Most of our students had little difficulty mastering the translation of simple declarative English sentences into predicate logic formulas. In a few cases, however, the script revealed that the original set of predicate logic formulas resulting from the translation was incorrect.</td>
