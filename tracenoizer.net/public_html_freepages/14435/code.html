 This is a powerful logic description language with abstraction facilities that allow fairly straightforward specification of digital systems up to the complexity of fairly large CPUs. However, note that both the language and the logic simulator were developed before the widespread introduction of graphical user interfaces, so they are purely textual. Some Pascal compilers produce incorrect object code without reporting any error messages. This collection is intended to demonstrate some of the more advanced features and to test the correctness of the compiler and simulator. C source code for a table preprocessor Some documentation for the table preprocessor The table preprocessor extends the Iowa Logic Specificaiton Language with truth tables, automatically translating such tables into random logic with the same behavior.</td>
