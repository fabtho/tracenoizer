 Suggestions for graphics extensions This set of suggested extensions to the Iowa Logic Specification Language allows graphical editing truth-table specification. . The Iowa Logic Specification Language The Iowa Logic Specification Language by Douglas W. Jones The Iowa Logic Specification Language was developed between 1983 and 1988, and was used for many years by various instructors at the U of Iowa for teaching digital logic design. This is a powerful logic description language with abstraction facilities that allow fairly straightforward specification of digital systems up to the complexity of fairly large CPUs.</td>
