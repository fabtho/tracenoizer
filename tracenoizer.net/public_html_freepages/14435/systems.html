Jones The Iowa Logic Specification Language was developed between 1983 and 1988, and was used for many years by various instructors at the U of Iowa for teaching digital logic design. This is a powerful logic description language with abstraction facilities that allow fairly straightforward specification of digital systems up to the complexity of fairly large CPUs. However, note that both the language and the logic simulator were developed before the widespread introduction of graphical user interfaces, so they are purely textual. Some Pascal compilers produce incorrect object code without reporting any error messages.">
