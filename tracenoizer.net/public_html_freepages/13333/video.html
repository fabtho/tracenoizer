 The transmediale is a platform for artistic and critical reflection on the role of digital technologies in present-day society. The festival provides a forum for communication between artists, those working in the media and a wide range of experts and offers a stimulating environment for the presentation of major new digital culture projects. This applies to Brecht's radio theory as much as it does to the development of video as an alternative to expensive film and television productions in the 60s and 70s, and to the camcorder and Internet revolutions of the 90s. While these hopes have only ever been fulfilled in part in society as a whole, the availability of new, affordable digital equipment has fostered a lively DIY scene over the past 10 years. This has provided a growing number of people with an opportunity to develop, present and distribute their own media productions themselves and even to create their own media tools.</td>
