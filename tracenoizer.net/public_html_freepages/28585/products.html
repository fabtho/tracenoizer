 Share it with colleagues and ask for their feedback. Values - your convictions on how business is to be conducted and people are to be treated, inside and outside the company. Mission - the products or services you provide, for whom, where, and how. The secondary or tertiary driving forces can legitimately be considered as decision influencers and can find their way into your strategy statement if they are strong enough.
