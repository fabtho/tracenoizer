 Six new observed times of minima are given and a new ephemeris is proposed. The basic parameters of the system extracted by our observations were used for spot modelling of the light curves. A simple spot distribution was determined, based on a model with one relatively small cool spot on the surface of the secondary. Absolute elements were calculated and the evolutionary status was determined. Our data favor a semi-detached configuration, with the secondary filling its inner Roche lobe; the primary must also be near the limits of its lobe.</td>

 com e-zine-- just enter your e-mail address, click subscribe, and we'll do the rest. . Often I find rather cool, fun old timer dives and sometimes posh places, sometimes taverns, that are just odd and amazing. I started doing this cuz I was sick and tired of going to the same ol' places. I still go to my favorite bars, but I mix it up more.</td>
