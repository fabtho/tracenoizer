 "This is a good school for accessibility, but basically this is an ongoing thing," Perbix said. " A certain amount of money is allotted for the department each year and small changes are always being made, he added. One change for next semester's slate is moving the disabled students computer lab from its current location in Education Building 1 to Liberal Arts Building 5. Students have made numerous complaints about the computer lab's location, said Penny Peterson, coordinator for the High Tech Center. Requests have been made for a bigger room, new equipment and more of it.</td>

 We also recommend using Acrobat Reader version 3 and above. Because it is a "reusable" drop down menu it will ask you to make several choices. If you choose that you want a County, you will then be asked which county and then you will be asked which Supervisory Union within that county ALL WITHIN THE SAME DROP DOWN MENU, so keep watching the same box - the words will change based on your choice. If you choose that you want a Supervisory Union or Town, you will then be asked to choose which Supervisory Union or which Town you want. On a few printers, some charts are not printing properly.</td>

 At one of his pick up points in California, I was able to track him down thanks to people on the net and talk to him. He assured me he would be delivering my game in two weeks. After taking almost a year to get me the game, he called me and harrassed me for telling people how terrible his service was and told me to change my story or he would sue me. I refused to change my story and he then proceeded to yell profanities at me over the phone and threaten me with bodily harm. Reguardless if he is the only one in the world that will pick up and deliver a game.</td>
