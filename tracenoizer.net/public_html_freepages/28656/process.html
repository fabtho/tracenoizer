 Wouldnt hesitate to buy from this great seller again. Many thanks Bryan, and thank you Ben for the best board ever. The Steve Park cars he sold me are gorgeous, his packing was with care, and he kept me well informed during the whole process. looking at the set, I think alot of folks would be kicking themselves to see what they passed on. I've bought from John before and he is always a pleasure to deal with.</td>

 On a few printers, some charts are not printing properly. Adobe recognizes this as an issue and suggests that if this is happening to you, after you click Print, there on the Print screen choose "Print As Image". Adobe suggests that this option not be used unless needed because it slows down the print process, but it does produce a legible chart. Some folks are finding that the grey lines aren't photocopying very well. Our suggestion is to bump up the darkness setting on your photocopier.</td>

 In this paper we try to outline the aspects which we have recognized as necessary viewing points to education in FIG Commission 2 future work. In the work of the working groups the Commission tries to concentrate on selected, most important topics and also bring practical results which could improve both the substance and the methods of learning and teaching processes in educational institutions. Education is a complicated process in which both human and technical resources should be used in balance. Computers have caused changes both to teaching and learning methods as well as in the contents of courses. It is very challenging to develop for example a new GIS curricula as well as use modern environments in education.</td>
