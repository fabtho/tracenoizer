 The County of Merced thanks you for your interest in this vitally important project. . The University Community Plan will be incorporated into the Merced County General Plan, and will establish the patterns and guidelines for future development of the University Community. In developing the Plan, Merced County is closely collaborating with the UC Merced, landowners, and the local community to address a wide range of issues of common concern. As a result of an extensive analysis of a range of alternative sites in eastern Merced County for location of the UC Merced campus and the associated University Community, UC and the County have jointly endorsed a shift of the location of the UC Merced campus to the southwest corner of the Virginia Smith Trust lands, on and around the Merced Hills Golf Course.</td>
