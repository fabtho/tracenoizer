 New laws appeared, threatening video pirates with a 5-year prison sentence. The insignificant supply of anime coming in by TV is, too, going away soon. Although we have Sailor Moon on the Moscow local TV, and we are already past a point when SM-R was stopped in North America, the channel which carries it lose its license last summer, and all the equipment and frequency go to the new channel which will be run by the city council. The only possibilities to get a soundtrack is sending a courier abroad or download it off the Internet. Because of complete absence of anime information, advertising and promotion, this causes the current state of anime as a second-degree art form.</td>
