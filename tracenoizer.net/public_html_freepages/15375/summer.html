 New laws appeared, threatening video pirates with a 5-year prison sentence. The insignificant supply of anime coming in by TV is, too, going away soon. Although we have Sailor Moon on the Moscow local TV, and we are already past a point when SM-R was stopped in North America, the channel which carries it lose its license last summer, and all the equipment and frequency go to the new channel which will be run by the city council. The only possibilities to get a soundtrack is sending a courier abroad or download it off the Internet.

 There are very few cities which do not have any historical buildings in Russia, and the checkerboard layout common for US cities is quite rare. Do not expect to find private houses within the borders of any city, there aren't any. In fact, living permanently in privately owned houses is only practised in village areas, suburban housing largely consisting of "dacha"s, summer homes of the wealthier part of the city's population. Communication and Computers In a big city, it is a rare apartment which doesn't have a phone installed, and while just three or four years ago the switching equipment was positively ancient, now it gets steadily replaced by modern optical lines.
