 Unlike rock music, they did not claw their way into minds of soviet citizens, maybe because pixel-perfect copying of artwork requires at least a photocopier, which were under careful state control at the time. You could not control the spread of magnetic tapes since sound recording equipment was available to the general populace, but you could stop comics. Situation changed a little during the last few years, when Disney's and similar comics (Duck Tales, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, ElfQuest) started to carve their niche in children's entertainment.
