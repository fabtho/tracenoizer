 Nobody knew anything about manga before, nobody knows now. It is not even rejected, it is just unknown to Russian reader. Small quantities of Manga-related objects do turn up inexplicably in all kinds of strange places, sometimes it's paint by number books, (often of exceptional quality) stickers and badges with unrecognizable faces drawn in the definite Japanese style. But these examples are just exceptions, the general rule being the absence of any coherent information about anything Manga-related. This niche was occupied by films of European, independent American and Japanese studios.</td>
