 I personally find the subject of transportation boring. I am however so appalled at the gross inefficiencies and see little hope of any change forthcoming that I can no longer sit by the side without protest. JS Also, I don't think personal freedom is a product, and the endless production of goods is what we're pushing ourselves to the brink with. GS No doubt there are a great many senseless products, that are needlessly exhausting precious resources. JS Let's just start concentrating on those important issues now.</td>

 These materials have important industrial applications, but many of the questions we are addressing deal with fundamental aspects of structure, composition and reactivity. Studies of catalytic kinetics, reaction pathways, and mechanisms are an important part of our work. Production of chemical intermediates and value-added products by clean catalytic processing provides an important environmental motivation for our research. The goal of this research is to prepare interfacial materials with controlled architectures and composition which have specific properties and applications. Several strong collaborations with industry have been involved in both our catalysis and materials research.</td>
