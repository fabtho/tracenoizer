 In this chapter, strategies for establishing, maintaining, and expanding law school community development programs are provided. Some of these points may seem intuitive; others, less so. They provide an opportunity for the university to engage in indepth, substantial community transformation. However, sustainability may be critical; if Community Development Corporations and community-based organizations become dependent on law school clinics to maintain their activities, the elimination of such a program can seriously affect a community and the standing of the law school and university in future efforts. Accordingly, it may be appropriate to start with other programs, such as an externship-based pro bono program, rather than directly launching a community development clinical program.</td>
