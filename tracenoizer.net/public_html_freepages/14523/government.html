The Post Conference Daily Calendar provides links to all information from the plenaries, roundtables, side events and press conferences. The Monterrey Conference also marked the first quadripartite exchange of views between governments, civil society, the business community, and the institutional stakeholders on global economic issues. The documents from the Conference and Mexican Government hosted events capture part of the spirit of the Monterrey Conference. Over 50 Heads of State or Government addressed the plenary on Thursday and Friday. The Summit also heard statements from the organizers of the Civil Society Forum, the International Business Forum and the Parliamentarians Forum.</td>
