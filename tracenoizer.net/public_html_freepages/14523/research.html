<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" These materials have important industrial applications, but many of the questions we are addressing deal with fundamental aspects of structure, composition and reactivity. Studies of catalytic kinetics, reaction pathways, and mechanisms are an important part of our work. Production of chemical intermediates and value-added products by clean catalytic processing provides an important environmental motivation for our research. The goal of this research is to prepare interfacial materials with controlled architectures and composition which have specific properties and applications.

 These will include such emerging technologies as a marine algae bandage, an omni-directional periscope camera, new anti-fouling ship hull coating and REMUS, the Navy's newest robotic undersea scout capable of searching for mines and other obstacles. . The ONR Afloat Lab is a shipboard demonstration laboratory showing navy-sponsored research, invention and technology. During Fleet Week the Afloat Lab will open to visitors and feature over two dozen displays, exhibits, and demonstrations. Williams The Office of Naval Research's Afloat Lab (YP679) ties up across from the Intrepid Musuem in New York City for Fleet Week.</td>

 . The one-time fund transfer will help faculty members compensate for higher costs of hiring UROP students starting July 1. From that time forward, the government will no longer allow universities to waive fringe benefits and indirect costs of research for UROP; they must be paid from faculty grants and accounts, just as UROP salaries are. This change will effectively double the cost to faculty of hiring UROP students and therefore make them much less fiscally attractive to hire. Elliot, professor of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences, has been looking for ways to minimize the new rules' impact on UROP.</td>
