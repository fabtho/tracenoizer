 Education and the health service were the main concerns, along with indirect taxes, and law and order. "If I could get hold of any of them they wouldn't be standing up," said Sue in Northampton, because of personal experience with health treatment. "I think it was a big mistake voting Labour - things have gone downhill and I'd want the Tories back with a strong leader," said Janet in Northampton. But others, who tended to be younger, were more positive. "Labour are definitely a little better - they need time to bring about change," said Shirley in Edgware.</td>

 In part the answer lies within the family and its condition when the challenge occurs. One classification of conditions affecting family functioning is shown in Figure 1. So the first defense against challenging life events is to be strong and stable, able to fully function. Those with family businesses, either related to agricultural enterprises or not, must also assess the state of their businesses. A similar categorization is shown in Figure 2 to summarize some of the key characteristics of financial performance of farm businesses.</td>

 The more clever otters even take up breaking and entering. The scientists found one tool-using otter that had learned to pick up old bottles from the sea floor and use them to bash abalones from rocks. One strong-jawed otter learned that little octopuses shelter in discarded aluminum beverage cans, and has developed a technique for ripping cans open with his teeth to get the animal inside. Once they have dinner secured, the otters can use sly tricks to see that it stays secured. The researchers observed some otters wrapping kelp fronds around captured crabs to keep them from wriggling away.</td>

 Production of chemical intermediates and value-added products by clean catalytic processing provides an important environmental motivation for our research. The goal of this research is to prepare interfacial materials with controlled architectures and composition which have specific properties and applications. Several strong collaborations with industry have been involved in both our catalysis and materials research. The transformation of abundant (but relatively inert) light alkanes (such as n-butane) into either gasoline range hydrocarbons or petrochemical intermediates is highly desirable. Vandium phosphorus oxides (VPO) have been discovered as excellent catalysts for performing such oxidations.</td>
