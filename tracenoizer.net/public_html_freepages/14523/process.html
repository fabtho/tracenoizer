 That upset me because I know it was him that got me the scholarship. " After studying music at Ulster Community College for two years, Schrader was accepted to a School of Music in Albany but felt "jaded" and stifled after another two years of study and left to follow an urge to bend the musical rules he was absorbing into forms he considered more suitable to his tastes. At 20, he began writing and recording material at a friend's studio in Port Ewen which he'd just as soon forget today but in the process began to learn "a lot about writing and guitar playing, how studios work, that kind of thing. " It was an experience which prompted him toward further study. "I went back to New Paltz and got a degree in video, audio and television production," Schrader recalls.</td>
