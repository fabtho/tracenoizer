The efficient electron acceptor was MB for hydrogen uptake reaction,and the donor for hydrogen evolution was MV REDUCED by Na2S2O4. A ratio of H2--uptake to H2--evolution was about 18. The pH optimum for H2--uptake and H2--evolution reaction were about 7.</td>

 In our current work, we are providing quantitative data concerning the redox cycle using in situ spectroscopic techniques such as laser Raman, FTIR and NMR spectroscopies. We are also using in situ FT-IR spectroscopy to determine of important aspects of the nature of the adsorbed species and reactive intermediates. Clean Fuels by Hydrodesulfurization Processing Using Reduced Ternary Molybdenum Sulfides Increasing environmental concerns throughout the world have resulted in new regulations governing fuel consumption, vehicular emissions, and refinery operation. Requirements for gasoline production have been established within the framework of the U. Clean Air Act of 1990 (including subsequent amendments) which has restricted sulfur- and nitrogen- compound emissions, aromatics content, and the production of carbon monoxide and ozone.</td>
