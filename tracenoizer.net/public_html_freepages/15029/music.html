 Dave Pearce biography BIOGRAPHY - PICS - TRACKS - LINKS Dave Pearce has a long record as a DJ on pirate, commercial and BBC radio, and in the clubs. His first taste of radio came in 1981 as a DJ on the popular pirate station Radio Jackie in South London, while he was still at school. Dave's passion for dance and black music saw him grab an opportunity to work behind the scenes at BBC Radio London where he persuaded bosses to give him a late night show playing all the top club tunes. He then helped create the BBC's first hip hop show, which became a cult late night show and helped launch the careers of previously unknown rap acts. After Dave persuaded the BBC station to hook up with top New York station WBLS for live satellite shows, he was approached by BBC television to help create their first dance show 'Behind The Beat'.</td>
