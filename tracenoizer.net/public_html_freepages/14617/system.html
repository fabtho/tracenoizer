 He is also the founder and director of the MIT Center for Coordination Science and one of two founding co-directors of the MIT Initiative on Inventing the Organizations of the 21st Century. Malone's research focuses on how new organizations can be designed to take advantage of the possibilities provided by information technology. Malone is known for having led the MIT team that developed the Information Lens system, a pioneering groupware tool in which intelligent agents help users find, filter, and sort large volumes of electronic information. Malone has been a co-founder of three software companies and has consulted and served as a board member for a number of other organizations. He has published over 50 research papers and book chapters and has been frequently quoted in publications such as Fortune, Scientific American, and Wired.</td>

 Because the two diseases involve similar parasites, the already established Fasciola model is applicable to the schistosomiasis model, Malone said. Malone first became interested in tracking the diseases when Yilma conducted post-doctoral research at the LSU School of Veterinary Medicine. By using outside information from climatology agencies and mapping services, Malone used a geographic information system to map the possible locations of the disease, as well as run statistical queries, data analyses and spatial distribution. The maps, which are connected with other databases, provide more capability for the researchers. Using the mapping software allows a visual representation of the research instead of just hard numbers or lists on paper, Malone said.</td>
