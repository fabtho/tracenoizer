 Geological Survey (USGS), in cooperation with the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) and nine southeast Michigan counties, began a study of the factors controlling arsenic concentrations in drinking water. The early results of this study raised broader concerns in Oakland County about the quality of groundwater in general and drinking water in particular. In response to these concerns, Oakland County worked with the USGS and the Center for Applied Environmental Research at the University of Michigan - Flint (CAER) to study distributions of arsenic, nitrate and chloride in groundwater, with emphasis on sites where concentrations of these constituents exceeded the Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs) and Secondary Maximum Contaminant Levels (SMCLs) set by the U. The maps produced for this report are based on historical data compiled from MDEQ records. The Oakland County fact sheet provides an overview of arsenic, nitrate, and chloride concentrations throughout the county, and information about health effects of these three substances in water.</td>

 It will appear normal microscopically and normal on the MRI. And since we can't stick probes into peoples' brain stems to measure current flow along these circuits, we have a poor way of evaluating the function other than to note what the output is. The research really started in earnest when people realized that this must be a brain disease. What are some of the hard evidences that have been found to mobilize these lesions or malfunctions to the brain stem. Growth hormone is important for bone mineral density -- how much calcium you have in your bones.</td>
