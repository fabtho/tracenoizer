 We are interested in using such models in a systems approach to understanding the production process. We are currently interested in finding the feasible ranges of products and the corresponding reactor and mixing systems that can achieve these. The technical approach for single phase reactors can be found in Smith and Malone (1997). Polymers are also good examples of materials that are often produced in batch processes (agricultural, specialty chemicals, and foods are others). Design tools for batch processing often need to account for a number of different products that can share resources.</td>

 .30, de riguer displacement sets the work in a netherworld of the poignantly pointless. With deft nonchalance Malone places Chinese funeral candles in the floorboard cracks, between installation parts comprising a car battery and headlights. A Fiat banner emblazons the wall, complimenting "DRIVE", an inverse replica of the Julian Dashper mural circa 1984, stencil-cut into black polythene. Fiat Lux is Latin for "Let there be light", so the back wall is painted with a rising sun, Asian style, and the headlights are unblinkingly appropriate.</td>
