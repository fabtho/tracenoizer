 Proper citation of sources is the best safeguard against plagiarism. Under certain conditions specified in the Law, libraries and archives are authorized to furnish a photocopy or other reproduction. One of these specified conditions is that the photocopy or reproduction is not to be "used for any purpose other than private study, scholarship, or research. " If a user makes a request for, or later uses, a photocopy or reproduction for purposes in excess of "fair use," that user may be liable for copyright infringement. This institution reserves the right to refuse to accept a copying order if, in its judgment, fulfillment of the order would involve violation of the Copyright Law.</td>

The main articles are very heavily documented and supported with research citations. A nice addition to the book is the mailing address of each contributing author. Also, I have a couple lists of references for further research.</td>
