 Dennis's early forays into active music-making involved chewing on the piano bench. Somewhat later, after a series of unpleasant piano lessons and a failed venture into playing the horn, he began to focus on percussion and electronics. At around the same time (somewhere in the early 1980's), Dennis met and became friends with Andy Crosby (who now produces amazing electro under the name Spesimen, with several releases on his own Infocalypse label and a 12" on the Dutch label Amici Curiae. ) Together, the two of them began earnestly exploring the rapidly growing world of electronic music, with a particular focus on such artists as Tangerine Dream and Kraftwerk. Eventually, Andy and Dennis ended up at different high schools and, inevitably, their musical interests began to diverge.</td>

 After finishing school in 1995, Beyer started work at the Planet Rhythm record store while releasing some tracks under a variety of names and continually djing all over Scandinavia. Adam Beyer sites Drumcodes 1 (Planet Rhythm 1995) as the first record to define his style; hard, percussive and loop oriented. His need to create the perfect dj tool gave rise to the launch of the Drumcode label allowing him total musical freedom. After six releases Beyer launched his second label Code Red focusing on a slightly softer side of techno. Code Red finished with its 10 th and final release Stand Down (Code Red 1999) which was a compilation of remixes from various international artists.</td>
