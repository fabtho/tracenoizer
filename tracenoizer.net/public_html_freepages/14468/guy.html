 He lives in Los Angeles and can be reached at his Raleigh Studios editing facility Post Magic at (323)871-5697. . Guy is a twenty-five year veteran of episodic television and independent films. Guy was the first director to screen a color film at The American Film Institute and the last director to get the Steven Spielberg contract at Universal Studios. In fact, Guy's anecdotes rival that of Speilberg's himself, including storming the Black Tower over at Universal, locking himself in an office with an executive and not coming out until he had a job.</td>
