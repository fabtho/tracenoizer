 So, I am going to fiddle with the icon until it makes me happy. It doesn't, really, but I couldn't think of anything else to open the column with this week, so that'll have to do. This week is a tribute to a game of legend, need I say more. Developer TimeGate Studios offers more than a dozen new heroes, tweaked AI, improved communication between you and computer-controlled allies and a variety of fixes, too. Coming in at less than 7MB, it's an easy download and a ton of play-value.</td>
