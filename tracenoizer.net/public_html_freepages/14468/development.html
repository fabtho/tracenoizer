 Six thousand children die of water-born diseases every day equivalent to, as he put it, "six jumbo jets full of children crashing every day". The minister's speech came at the close of a three-day water policy issues' workshop for journalists in Johannesburg organised and sponsored by the World Bank Institute in conjunction with the Dutch and Japanese governments. Set against the backdrop of the upcoming August 26 - September 4 World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) in Johannesburg and the 3rd World Water Forum in Japan in March next year, the mix of speakers and subjects was enthralling. We heard about the need for public-private partnerships to break the delivery backlog and the need to balance delivery programmes against environmental limitations like water table levels. We talked about South Africa's water law and about the "equitable share" of the national budget allocated to municipalities to help them drive the free basic water programme in their areas.</td>
