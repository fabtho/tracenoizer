 With the card guide and the rules, you can easily make the cards yourself and play. If you don't feel like figuring out how to make your own cards, go to the bottom of the page to find out how to order a set. To make things a little easier, here's the complete details about how I made the cards. It has a handy manual feed in the back, like most good printers these days. I bought 10 packages of 3" x 5" index cards from a local business supplies store.</td>

 . March 3, 2001 The game hasn't been working properly in quite a long time. I believe I've fixed things so the server will stay up now. This means that if you don't play at all for a long period of time (almost two months if you start with an RD of 50), you will eventually be removed from the official rankings until you play enough matches to lower your RD again. This should make it so that players who are currently active don't have to worry about having people above them in the rankings who haven't logged in in several months.</td>
