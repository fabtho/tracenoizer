 Alexander Alexandroff in Munich, composer and bassoon-player, works on a film with music by Terterian. With these pages, I want to promote Avet Terterian and I offer space to publish here. In the meantime, I met Kai Grehn, a german director and founding member of the foundation, and we discussed what to do. Please contact me, if you have material to contribute. .</td>
