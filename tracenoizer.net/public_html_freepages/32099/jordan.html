 He was trained at the University of Chicago and worked on the foundations of geometry during his early career. From there, he went to Princeton in 1905 to teach, and his interests quickly moved from geometrical researches to topology under the influence of the Princeton mathematical school. (24) In 1905, Veblen gave a correct proof of the Jordan curve theorem. (25) This theorem, a famous one in topology, states that a simple closed curve (such as a circle) lying in a plane divides that plane into two regions, one inside and one outside the curve. (26) Veblen gave a series of lectures on analysis situs in 1916, which were published in book form in 1922.</td>
