 Shible competes under Rocky Strassberg, Viktor Savitski and Theresa McKeon for Gemini School of Gymnastics, where she was the Level 10 National Vault Champion in 1999 and finished sixth on vault at nationals the year before. A National Honor Society student, Shible ranks fourth in a class of 400 at East Lake High School in Tarpon Springs, Fla. "I am looking forward to this group of outstanding student-athletes joining our squad," said Kutcher. "Emily, Lindsay and Ashley will fit right into our family and increase our depth, power and skill level. " The 2000 Denver Gymnastics season kicks off on Thursday, Dec.</td>
