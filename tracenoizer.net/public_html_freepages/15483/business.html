 RSG deployed one of the first Microsoft Site Server (Commerce Edition) implementation in the US. Furthermore, the developer stopped working and only two months to launch. RSG drafted business cases, and drew upon years of business experience to create a site with great customer experience. RSG immediately staffed the project, re-wrote the code, restructured the databases, and redesigned the site optimizing for customer-oriented look and feel. The site won Gartner Group's INTERNET BEST PRACTICES AWARD, for usability principles including clear intuitive goals and objectives.</td>
