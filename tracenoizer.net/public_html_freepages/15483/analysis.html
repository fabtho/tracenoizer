 Each subsection also describes a validation suite for the implementation of the primitive. . Detection Confidence and Statistical Analysis The Detection Confidence and Statistical Analysis development group is charged with Developing of statistical analyses to assess confidence and uncertainties in detection and parameter estimation This includes statistical tests involving single detectors, multiple gravitational wave detectors acting in concert or in coincidence, and gravitational wave detectors acting in coincidence with other (e.

 . Assess the adequacy and accuracy of the Marini and Murray model for SLR at the 1 mm level, for all elevations above 15 degrees and all wavelengths from 355 nm to 1570 nm and perhaps beyond. Prepare a formal recommendation to the ILRS, including a standard algorithm and set of recommended practices, for adoption by the stations and analysis centres. If this report indicates that revision is necessary, present a formal recommendation to ILRS at the ILRS Governing Board meeting subsequent to the Matera meeting. It might be desirable to extend the region of applicability to elevations lower than 15 degrees.</td>
