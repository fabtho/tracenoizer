 RSG staff use major statistical software packages including SPSS and SAS, and can convert data to and from many other database and statistical packages. . Sociometrics Research Support Group The Research Support Group (RSG) consists of Ph. and Masters level social scientists who provide assistance with customized data set extracts; user-defined statistical tables and analyses; data archiving, management and analysis services; customized CD-ROMs; and training workshops. Prices for services are determined on an individual basis.</td>

 Technical committees have been established to cover four technical strands - Subsurface, Seabed, Environment and Metocean - and to define and recommend projects for execution. The technical committees comprise representatives from selected exploration companies and the Petroleum Affairs Division (PAD), but may also draw on outside expertise from time to time. In excess of 60 proposals have been received from a broad spectrum of research organisations and companies and detailed reviews of existing data have been initiated. Work carried out by the RSG will be additional to normal licence - specific work programmes and will be screened to avoid duplication of effort across national or international boundaries. Co-operation with other joint industry and research groupings will be promoted, particularly those focusing on the Atlantic margin frontier area.</td>

 Also there is a continuing history of strong connections with the Physics Department on the Coral Gables campus of the University. . Remote Sensing Group The RSMAS Remote Sensing Group (RSG) is an interdisciplinary research group primarily based in the Division of Meteorology and Physical Oceanography of the Rosenstiel School, but with members distributed in Physics, Applied Marine Physics and Marine Biology and Fisheries. It is engaged in research and graduate instruction in the techniques of satellite oceanography and their application to problems in physical, biological and chemical oceanography. There is a strong link to the Atmospheric and Ocean Optics Group in the Physics Department.</td>
