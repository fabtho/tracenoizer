 RSG-Lab RSG-Lab The Remote Sensing and Geoinformatics Laboratory (RSG-Lab) has evolved during the past two decades into a valuable unit within ITC. For many staff and students the RSG-Lab has become an information center where immediate service can be obtained on various subjects. Production The production can be subdivided into the following categories Data Mining, whereby the customer is aided with the (online) search and ordering of image data. Input Service, where the customer is helped with the conversion and ingestion of the data for specific software packages. The Lab is especially equiped for handling large volumes of data.</td>

 RSG may be considered as a geometric processing tool box for remote sensing image data (see picture). . In particular, the treatment of different image data sets in multiple combinations with optimum degree of geometric accuracy is required for the exact geographic location of individual ground features, especially in mountainous regions. Moreover, multisensor remote sensing data have to be made available to be used in geographic information systems or environmental monitoring systems. Hence, based on many years of research in the field of remote sensing, the Institute for Digital Image Processing of JOANNEUM RESEARCH has developed RSG - the Remote Sensing software package Graz.</td>

 . Sociometrics Research Support Group The Research Support Group (RSG) consists of Ph. and Masters level social scientists who provide assistance with customized data set extracts; user-defined statistical tables and analyses; data archiving, management and analysis services; customized CD-ROMs; and training workshops. Prices for services are determined on an individual basis. For example, RSG staff can help you tailor a data set from over 50,000 variables in more than 150 nationally-recognized studies on adolescent pregnancy.</td>
