 I have Alan Greene on the line, would you like to take his call. I reached for the paper with the long list of instructions. This happened a few more times throughout the day, and every time I got a call for him I became a nervous wreck. I put the person on hold, got the paper out, and ran through the operation a few times in my head. I poised one hand above the console, flexed it a few times, then called Bob.</td>
