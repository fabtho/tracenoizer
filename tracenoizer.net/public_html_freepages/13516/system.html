 There are 3 expressions of length 1; 9 of length 2, and 27 of length 3. In general, if the vocabulary has n elements then the total number of possible expressions of length j or less is given by the summation over j of n to the jth power. This is an example of what is called a combinatoric system. In this system concatenation provides a basis for generating the set of all of the possible combinations that can be obtained from a base vocabulary. However, in a formal system not all possible expressions are legal or syntactically correct expressions.</td>

 My current project is porting Linux to DEC Alpha systems. I first became interested in multi-user, multi-tasking operating systems on small systems back when I was a user consultant at a computer facility in college. The system manager at this facility used to yell at me all the time for abusing my privileges (or stealing privileges I didn't have) for the sake of helping users get their work done. Steamed, I vowed that one day I'd get my very own multiuser system where I could be the boss and do as I pleased. At first, I tried implementing such a thing on my TRS-80, but gave up after a few days.</td>
