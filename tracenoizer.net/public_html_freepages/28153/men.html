 Date Bait is a remarkably simple concept dreamt up four years ago by an Argentine Jew, Rafael Risemberg, who patented it last summer. Risemberg, now a 41-year-old education professor at Kean College in New Jersey, started Date Bait in October 1996 as a scheme for rustling up some dates for himself. Risemberg, who is gay, planned his first event for men who wanted to meet other men "as a self-interested experiment," he told the Forward. "Fifty people signed up, and we were turning away more at the door. Risemberg has presided over more than 165 events and has expanded Date Bait to include sessions for heterosexual men and women, Jews and singles of various backgrounds and ages.</td>
