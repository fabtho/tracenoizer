 Detailed requirements for conducting matching programs are contained in Part 383 of the Departmental Manual (383 DM 12). . A computer matching program is a procedure in which a computer is used to compare two or more automated systems of records or a system of records with a set of non-Federal records to find individuals who are common to more than one system or set. The purpose of such matching programs is to improve Government operations; to reduce losses from fraud, abuse, error, or loan defaults; or to assure the proper use of Government funds and property. Strict adherence to the requirements of the Privacy Act of 1974 is required.</td>
