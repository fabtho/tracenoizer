 so i was wondering if anyone could recommend a song for me to play for when my parents come up to light a candle on my cake. so if you could give some suggestions that would be great. okay so i have sum songs, but i wanted to know the lyrics. cause i dont want to waste my time dling songs on my extremely slow computer if i know i dont even like the lyrics to it.
