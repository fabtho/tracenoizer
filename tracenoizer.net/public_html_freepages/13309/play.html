 Obviously the time to download depends upon the speed of your Internet connection. You can also download an Apple Mac version from here. Note Some players attempt to play the clip whilst it is still downloading. If the data transfer rate is slow, the player can run out of data and this will result in clipped music. If this happens, simply stop the playback until the entire clip is loaded, and then play from the beginning.</td>
