 During a recent ten-year period, Morgan graduated 10 percent of all the African-Americans in the nation who received the bachelor's degree in physics. Morgan is one of the top institutions in the country with respect to the number of its African-American bachelor's degree recipients who go on to earn graduate degrees. Morgan receives more applications for admission from African-American high school students than almost any other college or university in the country.

Designated as Maryland's public urban university, Morgan serves an ethnically and culturally diverse population.</td>
