<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" I decided to experiment further, first by removing and reapplying the magnet a few times. Each time the pain returned when the magnet was removed and all but completely disappeared again when reapplied. I then experimented by turning the magnet over to change its polarity from North, which is cooling and dispersing, to South, which is heating and building. I discovered that when the South side of the magnet was against the skin, the pain intensified and by reversing the magnet to North, it was alleviated. Since that time, I have been intrigued with the therapeutic possibilities of bio-magnetic therapy.">

 The College sublet space at 2183 Ashley Phosphate Road from Limestone College which had leased the space to offer courses for adults in the Charleston area.

 Its arrival was the culmination of a gradual expansion of regional TV news - the ten minute bulletins were expanded in 1962 to a 20-minute programme called Home At Six. Presented by Frank Bough, who had formerly been a manager at the ICI works at Billingham, Home At Six was famous for its opening sequence in which Frank hung his hat on a wooden hat stand. Mike moved to Tyne Tees in 1996 and was replaced by a new partnership of Carol Malia and John Lawrence, local journalists born in Tynemouth and Hartlepool respectively, who've continued the Look North tradition of combining authoritative news coverage with lighter, more personal moments. Newcastle has always been the headquarters for coverage of the region - the very first broadcast from the city was in 1922, several years before the BBC received its Royal Charter and formally came into being. When the BBC moved to new purpose-built headquarters in 1988, the address was taken by Newcastle Building Society.</td>
