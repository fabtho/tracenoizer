 Washburn University is a co-sponsor of High Q along with CBS Channel 13. High Q is an academic competition approved by the Kansas State High School Activities Association. The top sixteen teams advance to a televised competition. Funds for the building were provided by Harrison Morgan, longtime a member of the Board of Trustees of Washburn College, as a memorial to his wife. A three-story addition to the building was completed in 1967.</td>
