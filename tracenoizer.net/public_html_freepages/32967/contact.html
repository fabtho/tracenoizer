 I have been a columnist for Distributed Computing magazine, now I'm on the advisory board for Software Development magazine and IEEE Software where I also edit the design column. Much of my work these days is with clients of ThoughtWorks, but I still do some outside work - including speaking at corporate events and particularly interesting projects. If you want to find out more about getting hold of me contact my assistant Cameron Reiss who can fill you in on my availability, and on the various things I can do with my able colleagues here at ThoughtWorks. I became an independent consultant in 1991 and since then have seen a lot of companies as a consultant. While I've enjoyed a lot of this work, I'd never imagined joining any of them.</td>
