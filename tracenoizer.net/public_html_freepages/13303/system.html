 . Having ROX-Filer will make things slightly easier, but you can use it without. Extract the archive (eg, by dragging it to Archive) and click on System in a ROX-Filer window (if you don't have an application-directory-aware filer then go into the System directory and run AppRun manually). If you got the source version, there will be a brief delay while it compiles. .</td>

 . This site is dedicated to supporting the community around CVS. CVS is the Concurrent Versions System, the dominant open-source network-transparent version control system. Its unreserved check-out model to version control avoids artificial conflicts common with the exclusive check-out model. org This site allows you to start and manage projects related to CVS.</td>

 Technical Tools - Find tools to assist in modeling environmental conditions, assessing water quality and more. EPA Models - Models are used to increase the level of understanding about natural systems and the way in which they react to varying conditions. Biology Registry System (BioRS) - The Biology Registry System (BioRS) provides information on biological organisms and how they are represented in the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations and information systems. Chemical Registry System (CRS) - The Chemical Registry System (CRS) is the EPA's central system for chemical identification information and provides a common basis for identifying chemicals listed in EPA regulations and data systems, and chemicals of interest from other sources, such as publications. Envirofacts - A national information system that provides a single point of access to data extracted from seven major EPA databases.</td>
