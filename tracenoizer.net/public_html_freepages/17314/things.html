 If we owe something to the king of this physical world, we cannot go up. Just like if you are a criminal of some nation, you are not clear of the record, you can not pass beyond the border to go to another nation. So, the debt of this world includes many things that we've done in the past and in the present and maybe in the future days of our physical life. Now all these have to be cleared, just like we clear the customs, before we can go into the world beyond. But when we are in the second world, we start to work, you understand, with any left-over karma of the past and this present life.</td>

 We all heard that in different kinds of religious bibles or scriptures, it is mentioned that there are seven heavens, there are different levels of consciousness. There is the Kingdom of God within, there is Buddha nature, etc. These are some things that are promised beyond this world. But not many people have access to what is promised in these scriptures, not many. Compared to the population of the world, people who have access to the Kingdom of God within or what we call, "what is beyond this world", are very few.</td>

 However, it does not address many nuts-and-bolts issues surrounding the use of real OO languages, tools, and systems for distribution in part because so few of them (of appropriate production quality) were available at the time of writing. While Part II consists largely of OO Design Patterns, they are not phrased as such, mainly because this was written before now-common ideas about presenting, structuring and documenting patterns arose. While there are many things we'd do differently if we were rewriting this book, there are no current plans for a second edition. However, Dennis and Penlope have written a book on OO Development Process and Metrics, and Doug has written one on Concurrent Programming in Java. No, there are not postscript versions or any other copyable files available.</td>
