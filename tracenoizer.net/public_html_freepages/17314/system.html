 The Panel was given the task of formulating a "conceptual design of a long-term, systematic observing system to monitor, describe, and understand the physical and biogeochemical processes that determine ocean circulation and the effects of the ocean on seasonal to decadal climate changes and to provide the observations needed for climate predictions. . Ocean Observing System Development Panel The Ocean Observing SystemDevelopment Panel (OOSDP) Purpose of Panel The Ocean Observing System Development Panel was established in 1990 by the Committee on Climatic Changes in the Ocean (CCCO) of the Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research-Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (SCOR-IOC) and the Joint Scientific Committee (JSC) of the International Council of Scientific Unions-World Meteorological Organization (ICSU-WMO). The Panel was given the task of formulating a "conceptual design of a long-term, systematic observing system to monitor, describe, and understand the physical and biogeochemical processes that determine ocean circulation and the effects of the ocean on seasonal to decadal climate changes and to provide the observations needed for climate predictions. .</td>

 They will be dissected and killed later in the flight, along with a number of other rodents. It was the second set of dissections performed in the floating spacelab since Columbia blasted off Friday on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's most in-depth neurological research mission to date. On Saturday, astronauts removed the brains of four rats so scientists can see how the nervous system changes in weightlessness. In all, 47 of the 170 mice and rats on board are to be dissected. More rats and all of the 135 snails and 229 swordtail fish on Columbia will be killed and dissected once they are back on Earth.</td>

 Indeed, on many systems (such as FreeBSD and Windows) even a non-privledged user can specify whatever identd response they want. The protocol is most useful on multiuser systems as a method of tracking down problem users. If one of your users is causing problems on another system, that system's admin can inform you of the username of the specific user causing problems, saving you a lot of legwork. On systems with many users, the benefits could be great, but it doesn't serve any particular purpose on a single user box. Not running identd may limit your ability to connect to certain servers - many IRC and some FTP servers don't allow, or severly restrict, non-identd'd connections, for example.</td>
