 He does not actually say that tales of mass murder are all a bunch of evil capitalist lies, he merely contemptuously condemns and ridicules those who tell the truth about Cambodia, while praising to the sky the (often entirely imaginary) sources that deny democide in Cambodia. He does not actually say in so many words that the press was giving undue and excessive attention to Pol Pot's Cambodia, he merely leads the reader to believe it. (In actual fact stories about human rights violation in South Korea and Pinochet's Chile outweighed stories concerning Cambodia by ten to one. ) Chomsky uses the same method to deceive the reader about the authorities and facts that he claims support his view. These reports also emphasize both the extraordinary brutality on both sides during the civil war (provoked by the American attack) and repeated discoveries that massacre reports were false.</td>

 It always amazes me how he can simplify the most obscure concept and make it presentable in layman's terms. The tremendous resources and brilliant scientists at the NIH have been impressive. The fact that scientists come here from all over the globe to collaborate on research, despite cultural - and sometimes language - barriers, is equally impressive. I obtained housing through the Human Resources personnel at the National Institute on Aging in Baltimore. I would suggest using their resources if you want to be surrounded by other students.</td>

 the essence of human communication is the human and the relationships it has with 3 things - the communicator, the person(s) to be communicated to, dn the environment at the given time. in most cases we hear words not thoughts even though those words are supposed to convey thoughts. This is vastly due to the fact that most people spend too much time thinking how to say the words right rather than concentrate on the content of what the thought they need to convey. it is an importartant part of any communication to be effective and optimum as you use the word. Miscommunication is oftetn from lack of understanding and grasp of our own thoughts before the communication rather than the other persons or the contents.</td>
