 Science for Families Science for Families This project will implement a statewide Science for Families project with the goal of involving teachers, parents and children in science inquiry. The program provides science content appropriate for K-8 learners and is based on the teaching of science for conceptual understanding for all students, with a focus on female, ethnic and racial minority students. Primary emphasis is on involving adults and children in the science learning process, particularly through the use of concrete materials, cooperative learning and relevant learning experiences. We hope to have this training available by the spring of 1999. .</td>

 . The wood preserving operation used creosote as a preservative up until 1966, then changed to pentachlorophenol (PCP). From 1966 to 1973, the site used a process that allowed approximately 72,000 gallons of PCP to drip from treated wood directly onto the ground. In addition, approximately 3,200 gallons of PCP-contaminated sludge were applied directly to the ground. The site is partially fenced and located in a rural area.</td>

 While Part II consists largely of OO Design Patterns, they are not phrased as such, mainly because this was written before now-common ideas about presenting, structuring and documenting patterns arose. While there are many things we'd do differently if we were rewriting this book, there are no current plans for a second edition. However, Dennis and Penlope have written a book on OO Development Process and Metrics, and Doug has written one on Concurrent Programming in Java. No, there are not postscript versions or any other copyable files available. If you want your own copy, you'll have to buy the book.</td>
