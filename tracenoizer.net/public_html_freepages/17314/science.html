 We hope to have this training available by the spring of 1999. . Science for Families Science for Families This project will implement a statewide Science for Families project with the goal of involving teachers, parents and children in science inquiry. The program provides science content appropriate for K-8 learners and is based on the teaching of science for conceptual understanding for all students, with a focus on female, ethnic and racial minority students. Primary emphasis is on involving adults and children in the science learning process, particularly through the use of concrete materials, cooperative learning and relevant learning experiences.</td>

 Current Volume (Volume 43) Volume 43, Number 1, January 2002 (pp. . Material Transactions Online Materials Transactions, Online The Japan Institute of Metals (JIM) supports the worldwide dissemination from Japan of research results from basic sciences to applied technology in the field of materials science and engineering. Since January 2001, JIM has therefore issued its journal, formerly called Materials Transactions JIM, as an electronic journal to broaden the international distribution and ensure the prompt delivery of scientific and technical information. The journal, now simply entitled Materials Transactions from January 2001, is appropriately designated as an international journal published collaboratively with other institutes involved in materials science and engineering.</td>
