 This theme has taken me from research on knowledge systems, to collaboration technology, to trusted systems for digital publishing, and now to sensemaking technology. My main work between 1993 and 1999 was in developing technology for digital property rights -- leading to ContentGuard and also founding the Secure Document Systems area for computer security research at PARC. From robots to human computer interaction to software agents, the distinguishing feature of these systems has been the coordinated, distributed, concurrent interaction of a community of computational entities. In each of these initially separate endeavors, I have exploited communal architectures to advance the state of the art. In the reconceptualized Computer Science, these nontraditional architectures are transformed from anomalous special cases to central examples.</td>
