 Backing musicians include Paul Brady, Donal Lunny, Liam OFlynn and Frankie Gavin. Andy has tended to sell this only at gigs, not making it available to shops. Great harp playing by the harpist with The Bumblebees. Watch out for his most amazing version of Miss McLeod. Superb concertina and flute playing by Padraig Rynne and Brian Duke.</td>

 On Friday it was time to head to Virginia for a night of rest before our last gig. Susan got the guest cottage which means she got to stay in the same bed as John Renbourn, only John wasn't there at the time. He only stays there when he's playing at the Prism. The Prism folks were a truly great audience and even joined on on the pig-tail-slashing song. .</td>
