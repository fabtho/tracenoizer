 Minicycle This web page is part of the IMBA, the world's largestminibike web site. I showed your picture to my wife and it reminded us of our early marrieddays nearly 28 years ago. We had a little half scale Model T go kart we used to put around theneighborhood in during 1972. We are still very young but I am a lot heavier these days. The minibikeshave to grunt now and I would never fit in the Model T anymore (ha).</td>

 . Although the losers trailed by only two points at the interval, 0-9 to 1-4, the more determined Bruree men were always shaping up like eventual winners. David O'Keeffe set Bruree on the road to success when he goaled in the fourth minute of the second half. Aidan Frawley rose another green flag to put Bruree in the driving seat, though goals by Padraig Tobin and Paddy Connery kept Kilmallock in touch. In the end, Bruree were to prove far superior and on present form they will be firm favourites to beat Bruff in the decider.</td>
