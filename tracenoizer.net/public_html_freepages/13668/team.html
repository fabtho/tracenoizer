 Aidan Frawley rose another green flag to put Bruree in the driving seat, though goals by Padraig Tobin and Paddy Connery kept Kilmallock in touch. In the end, Bruree were to prove far superior and on present form they will be firm favourites to beat Bruff in the decider. Bruree fielded a very experienced team while Kilmallock had a few players new to this grade of hurling. Nevertheless Kilmallock will need to pick themselves off the ground in advance of the county championship. James Connery, Tom Hennessy, Padraig Tobin, Paddy Connery and Mark Cronin were the pick of Kilmallock.</td>
