 . While it's not directly related to Optigan stuff, there is Optigan to be found on the album, and generally speaking I think the spirit of the whole project falls right in line with the spirit of all this Optigan research. I took loads of found audio recordings and collaged them into one big mess of everyday people talking and singing about all sorts of things. Sources of found audio include homemade phonograph records, open reel tapes, and cassettes. Click on the links below to hear some excerpts in .</td>

 . Josh Bakehorn Here is some music I composed, performed, and recorded. These are basically crude demos of everything, so things are a little rough on the edges, etc. , but they stand as decent examples of some things I can do. I hate that these are in mono; it doesn't do the original stereo mixes any justice.</td>

 Surely observations like this are relevant to lots of other music. I think that this makes the powerful effects the music can have on me more mysterious. Some other things I fare better with, like the beginning to "Helps Both Ways" (the beginning being pretty good, because my memory for melodies isn't great anyway so it tends to trail off for most songs regardless of how melodic they are) or "A Cheery Wave From Stranded Youngsters", which is admittedly a good deal more hummable than many others. So it was hard to capture that frame of mind (whatever it was - I remember I was in the middle of walking home, at night, in the cold, and I had passed through a building to get warm for a few minutes) or even really hear the song the same way again. Tonight it's different still - not the same but new.</td>
