 under Big Brother, Don't mess up our lives, and vote us all out. . If you followed the Big Brother 2000 show or watched the Internet feeds you will be well aware of Josh's love for music. In a crowd or late at night in the yard by himself, Josh had a big selection for you. It's hard to pick out just a few, but how about these.</td>

 I think maybe he just loves the soothing melody of the Esraj's voice. I play an Authentic Tack Piano, Drums, Ukulele, and Vocals. I really love Ragtime music, so I had a lot of fun doing this. I would love to hear what you think of these songs. Feel free to email me your comments and questions about any of this.</td>
