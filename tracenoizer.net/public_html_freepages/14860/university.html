 Sue Peabody learned of The Art of Computer Game Design, which was then long out of print. Crawford's permission to publish an electronic version of the text on the World Wide Web so that it would be available to her students and to others interested in game design. Washington State University Vancouver generously made resources available to hire graphic artist Donna Loper to produce this electronic version. Correspondance regarding this site should be addressed to Prof. If you are interested in more recent writings by Chris Crawford, see the Reflections interview at the end of The Art of Computer Game Design; the Virtools Swap-meet interview with Chris Crawford; and Chris Crawford's webpage, Erasmatazz.</td>
