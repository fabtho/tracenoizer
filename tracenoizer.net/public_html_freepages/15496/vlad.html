 T617 D7 1996 1 BOOK LEE-LIB There is an element of truth to the fiction, however, both from the dark but real history of Transylvanian castles and from a figure taken from the fifteenth century. There had been a nobleman of Transylvania who was ignoble. This ignobleman's name was Vlad Tepes, and Prince Vlad "earned" for himself the nickname "Vlad the Impaler. And you have to admit, the names Vlad and blood do sound a lot alike. Actually, Vlad ruled over Wallachia, an area south of Transylvania, but Transylvania gets the bum rap because Vlad was born there.</td>
