 The majority of its people are Romanians, but about a quarter of the population are Magyars (Hungarians). Magyars make up the largest ethnic group in Hungary. The Carpathian Mountains and Transylvanian Alps separate the region from the rest of Romania. For years, Romanians and Hungarians quarreled over Transylvania. From 1526 to 1699, Transylvania was part of the Ottoman (Turkish) Empire.</td>

 Here is a picture of the infamous Bran Castle which is considered in folklore to have been his castle. Bran Castle is standing today as seen in the picture. It is placed in the middle of the Carpathians Mountains, on the border between Transylvania and Wallachia, two of the three historical regions composing Romania. The castle is built on a rock in the narrowest point of the Turcu river valley. From this position the visibility was very good and even increased when the forest was cut down.</td>
