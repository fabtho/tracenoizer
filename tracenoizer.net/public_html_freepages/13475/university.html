 Historic Newspaper May Belong to Charleston Library The Charleston (S. The purchaser, the Charleston Post and Courier Foundation, has put the transaction on hold until ownership can be verified. The library had no idea the paper might have come from its collection until Terry Lipscomb, an independent researcher at the South Caroliniana Library at the University of South Carolina in Columbia, pointed out that historian Lyman Draper had consulted that very issue there in 1871. Sadler, told American Libraries that the copy was not there in the 1950s when her predecessor had the newspaper collection microfilmed. According to the July 1 Post and Courier, the pattern of stains on the auctioned copy appears similar to patterns on previous and subsequent issues in the collection.</td>
