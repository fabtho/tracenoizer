 Joe actually grew up on a hog farm in Secaucus, New Jersey. Born in 1946, he got into rock and roll for a while in the '60s' and then just exited the music scene -- for almost 30 years. He supported his family with many occupations (even now he owns a waste hauling company) but his true calling resurfaced thanks to a John Stewart songwriting workshop. This song collection (12 of them originals) is as honest and sincere as the man himself -- or at least how he comes across in print interviews. His are stories of nostalgia, family, place and things that really matter.</td>
