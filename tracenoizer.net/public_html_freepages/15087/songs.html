 " The most moving cut, "Furnace Of Humility," is based on Biblical scripture. For I have joined the elders now and I must take my stand in the furnace of humility I will trust His mighty hand. " McKay also includes an excellent rendition of John Stewart's "Dreamers On The Rise" and dedicates the Stewart-sounding "Songs From The Heart," to the ex-Kingston Trio member.
