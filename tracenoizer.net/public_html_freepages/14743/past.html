 These groups are working groups and you will need to show you are doing something to maintain them. It's not a case of paying a membership and sitting back for the duration (like joining the BKA). Many populations seen in the past are missing, notably A. cognatum but I think now, with this worldwide co-operation of conservation, new populations will become part of this list. Although we don't know the exact area of collection apart from 'an area close to an airport or landing stage' these are probably the only wild fish from the group we will see for a while given the troubles in that part of the world.</td>

 I have to credit IC as an important part of helping me learn to create possibilities. " The possibilities started when Rivera arrived at IC on a Greyhound bus and found strong support from Nick Wharton, then director of the Educational Opportunity Program, and business professor Abraham Mulugetta. From Wharton, Rivera learned the importance of keeping a positive perspective; from Mulugetta, he learned the need to leverage past experience to create his future. at Harvard Business School, then moved to Los Angeles to work in the strategic marketing department of Capitol Records. He went into business for himself, first as a management consultant for SONY Music, Rosenbluth International, and Latino.</td>
