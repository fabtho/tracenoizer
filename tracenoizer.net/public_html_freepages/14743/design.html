 . So in November of 1995, I created my own web site to put together my own reviews and discussions on the films of Oliver Stone. Unbelievably, the pretty simple, basic design of the site remained the same for six years, and unfortunately did not progress with the times. Pages and bits were added here and there, but the simple design never changed. On the web site's sixth anniversary, I undertook a massive reconstruction of the entire web site, taking into account a number of suggestions and complaints I received over the years, as well as incorporating a brand new navigational design more consistent with the web technology of today.</td>
