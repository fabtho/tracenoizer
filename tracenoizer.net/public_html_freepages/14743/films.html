 Meadows has also received awards from the Stanford University Digital Art Center, Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, San Francisco Focus Magazine, and Stoli Vodka. .

From feature and experimental films to digital art, he explores how discourse constructs itself. His early films, 'auto-re-tour' and 'fini-la guerre', investigate the tensions between narrativity and the pure surface of film.</td>
