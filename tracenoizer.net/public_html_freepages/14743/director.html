 Support our efforts and make a generous donation to the FilmMakers Film Fund. . A director interprets the script, coaches the performers, works together with the montagist, etc. According to Film Scholar Eric Sherman, the director begins with a vague idea of the entire film and uses this to help him determine what is to be done. He gains most when others are given their freedom to show what they know.</td>

 In a letter to WSWS arts editor David Walsh writer John Nichols, author of The Sterile Cuckoo, contributed this recollection of Alan Pakula. In 1965 or '66 Alan Pakula hired me to write a screenplay of The Sterile Cuckoo. I went to LA a couple of times and spent long sessions with him and Bob Mulligan (director of To Kill a Mockingbird, which Alan produced). Alan was a warm, gentle, intelligent, amazingly hard-working and personable guy. I was surely impressed, as it immediately queered any prejudices about stereotypical Hollywood that I might have harbored.</td>
