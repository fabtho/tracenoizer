 When growing scab resistant cultivars, fungicides are either not applied or their applications are reduced. As a result, control of summer diseases has become a major consideration on these cultivars. Larson Research Center at Rock Springs on an acre of scab-resistant apple cultivars which was established in 1992. Our primary research objective has been to determine the commercial potential of scab resistant apple cultivars and develop an optimum disease management program that will produce high quality fruit and reduce disease to economic levels with a minimum in pesticide applications. For information on our research findings please refer to the publications.</td>

Research plays a secondary and often tertiary role at these institutions (behind both teaching and service). Virtually all of these institutions have strong core or general education requirements to assure the liberally or broadly educated individual. This type of institution is in many ways the antithesis of the liberal arts and sciences college.</td>
