 Further comments and suggestions are, of course, welcome. . They would particularly like to thank ICNL's staff and interns, who contributed to the production of this volume in numerous ways. The World Bank's Law Project is jointly managed by Hans Jurgen Gruss (Legal Department) and John D. A partial listing of persons who contributed in some way is listed below.</td>

 the biggest research center and museum in the world devoted to electronic art. InterCommunication Center, Tokyo (Japan), the main media art centre in its country. For the first time, in these works the production, distribution and reception mean is the same. net_condition has been organised precisely out of the willingnes of all four participating centres to work together in a descentralized way, in a space which is shared and accesible from anywhere in the world. Each participating centre presents, on occasion of the show, some new works developed specially for the Internet.</td>

 High seedling emergence and survival on unwatered plots, even during a 'drought year,' suggests Prosopis recruitment is not contingent upon unusual or episodic rainfall. Reductions in biomass and density of herbaceous vegetation had no influence on seedling emergence, growth or survival suggesting that Prosopis invasion is minimally influenced by grass competition. Historic grazing at this site appears to have altered herbaceous composition and reduced above- and belowground biomass production below the threshold level required for competitive exclusion of woody vegetation. Such data suggests that rates and patterns of seed dispersal may be the primary determinants of P. glandulosa encroachment on present-day landscapes in semi arid regions.</td>
