 As a controller, it is the most versatile synth I've ever used; I've had up to four instruments connected to the MIDI out, making great use of the multitimbral output. At its introduction, it was really advanced for its time, and when it finally stopped working I was sad to see it go. The small-key format led me to produce some really fast lead-line work and some unusual chord colours; single handed 5 and 6 note chords not possible using large keys unless you have gargantuan hands. Other outboard devices include an Atari ST (with sequencing and patch editor software (Bryan Kennerley's PSS-Ed). We used the onboard sequencer to produce some nice sequences "on the move" in the middle of performances, where countermelodies and harmonies were required.</td>
