 Many of you may have heard of me before, but for those who haven't I'd like to take this opportunity to introduce myself and talk about some of the goals I have for the CFA this year. I first got involved in the "Atheist Movement" two years ago when I started a high school Atheist Club in Michigan. Forming the club was no easy task and I ended up enlisting the support of Americans United for Separation of Church and State as my lawyers. First, it taught me that running a club is extremely hard, both because of the lack of funds and simply because it takes some great ideas and materials to sustain the club's membership. The second thing I learned is that there is a whole community of individuals who are willing to help.</td>

 By Micah White Before I begin let me just say, I am extremely happy to be here. It is quite an honor to get this opportunity to speak to this organization, and I am also honored to receive this award. I just got back from the Americans United for Separation of Church and State conference in D. When I first arrived there I was wearing the coat I always wear around school, and in public--a coat which has a patch that says, simply, "Atheist. " When I met one of my friends from the Council for Secular Humanism outside the hotel, he told me that most people within the AU conference wouldn't enjoy it.</td>

 " Guntzel noted that many protesters come from the ranks of the anti-globalization movement, eager to torpedo policy on the front lines. "They have ushered in a new style of protest," he said. "There is less and less meeting in church basements," said Lems of the American Friends Committee. " But perhaps the greatest strategic advantage of the peace lobby in rallying public opinion against war in Iraq is the 11 years of sanctions imposed on that country after the Gulf War. "It's unlikely that Bush could have picked a worse target for his second step," said White, one of the Swarthmore students fomenting against war.</td>
