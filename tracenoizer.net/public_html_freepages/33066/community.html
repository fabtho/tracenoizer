 " Weblife Tools for Living Since Thoreau, Americans have escaped the horrors of urban life by going back to the land. Weblife continues that tradition with a mixture of new age philosophy and practical information on agriculture, food storage, the mass media and computer security. (Slashdot, probably the only successful community site, is so because of it's targeting a lowest common denominator and flirtation with the mainstream media. ) Athiest club Religion When Micah White tried to start an club for athiests at his high school, the administrators and principal refused. His family went to a lawyer and the school backed down.</td>

 Military Action May Get Peace Movement Rolling-Global Policy Forum- NGOs Military Action May Get Peace Movement Rolling By Johanna Neuman Los Angeles Times September 2, 2002 It's unlikely that Democrats, not wanting to look soft on terrorism, will buck the White House's war. As the debate over President Bush's plans for Iraq grows louder in Washington, the voice of the nation's peace movement has been muted. Far from the mainstream, often connected only by the stealth power of the unseen Internet or the quiet muscle of community activism, the peace lobby--robust during the Vietnam War and highly visible during the 1991 Persian Gulf War--has been on the sidelines of public debate. Secretaries of State and other guardians of the foreign policy establishment have taken to the editorial pages of the nation's top newspapers to argue strategy, tactics and consequences. Commentators have accused each other of conspiracy to either foment or slow war, while agreeing that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is an evil force whose ouster would be universally applauded.</td>
