 From start to finish the tral condition, markings and aid stations make this a must for anyone who wants to try a trail 50 miler or anyone who wants to get first class treatment in an ultra race. Glenda and family, Don Huges, John Swallow, and there cast of volunteers make this a special run. With 40 of the 50 miles on the Pacific Crest Trail I hope this coarse will be the one for many years to come. Thanks to the aid station volunteers, you were great. Also thanks to the runners that helped motivate me to keep running, hats off to you for your great efforts.</td>

 com Hey I'm Chris, and I live 30 minutes from Swarthmore. I am captain of my lacrosse team and I enjoy being outside and spending time with friends. It's been nice chatting with some of you and I hope to hear from the rest. I like friendly discussions about music, art, philosophy, etc. I'm not sure if I'm going to go to Swat or not, but I'm definitely leanin' there.</td>
