 Your smiles and enthusiasm made it comfortable on a very windy and cold day. From start to finish the tral condition, markings and aid stations make this a must for anyone who wants to try a trail 50 miler or anyone who wants to get first class treatment in an ultra race. Glenda and family, Don Huges, John Swallow, and there cast of volunteers make this a special run. With 40 of the 50 miles on the Pacific Crest Trail I hope this coarse will be the one for many years to come. Thanks to the aid station volunteers, you were great.</td>

Our family moved two years ago to a conservative city in Michigan--Grand Blanc. During 10th grade I was new, so I didn't talk much. But near the end of the year a student wrote an op-ed asking for creationism to be taught in science class.</td>
