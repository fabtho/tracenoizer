 Many of you may have heard of me before, but for those who haven't I'd like to take this opportunity to introduce myself and talk about some of the goals I have for the CFA this year. I first got involved in the "Atheist Movement" two years ago when I started a high school Atheist Club in Michigan. Forming the club was no easy task and I ended up enlisting the support of Americans United for Separation of Church and State as my lawyers. First, it taught me that running a club is extremely hard, both because of the lack of funds and simply because it takes some great ideas and materials to sustain the club's membership. The second thing I learned is that there is a whole community of individuals who are willing to help.</td>

 It is not clear when the students will be released from jail, but there are reports that Colman and Holt may be back on campus today. Warrick Cardozo by Shavaugn Lewis Gazette Sportswriter In celebration of diversity on Swarthmore's campus, the Gazette would like to highlight an interesting fact about the various cultures each week. In recognition of Black History Month, February's facts will focus on African Americans and their achievements over the years. If you have an interesting fact about a culture feel free to write in and share. We hope that by sharing these little-known facts we will increase knowledge of other cultures, and in turn promote unity amongst all members of the Swat community.</td>

 By Micah White Before I begin let me just say, I am extremely happy to be here. It is quite an honor to get this opportunity to speak to this organization, and I am also honored to receive this award. I just got back from the Americans United for Separation of Church and State conference in D. When I first arrived there I was wearing the coat I always wear around school, and in public--a coat which has a patch that says, simply, "Atheist. " When I met one of my friends from the Council for Secular Humanism outside the hotel, he told me that most people within the AU conference wouldn't enjoy it.</td>
