 I think I speak for everyone when I suggest a full boycott until this abominable oversight is corrected. Swarthmore Progressive Action Committee and Why-War. com sent students to the weekend protest on Saturday. The protest was organized by Another World is Possible. The majority of the students left after Saturday's protests but several students decided to stay behind and attend Sunday's protests as well.</td>

 It was in 11th grade that I formulated the idea to form a high school atheist club, in response to the already established student bible club. My first step was to find out what the laws were concerning student clubs, since I knew that my club would most likely face opposition from the administration. While surfing the internet I stumbled across a guide for students who wanted to form bible clubs. Since my school already had a bible club it would be illegal for them to stop my club simply because it was atheist. Armed with this information I approached my principal and asked what I had to do in order to start a student club.</td>

 HMC Computer Science Department Olin Science Center 301 E. . Harvey Mudd Computer Science Student Staff The Harvey Mudd College Computer Science Staff is a dynamic team of Harvey Mudd students who are dedicated to the upkeep and administration of the Computer Science computers. We do it mostly because we like root privs, and we have a good time working with each other. We have a fairly well distributed collection of the four classes listed below.</td>

 The runners, who met for the first time this weekend, were a little anxious at first, but that quickly faded. "There's a lot of family-ness with the group already," Harris says. Most are students, but one is a teacher, and several sacrificed jobs, graduation ceremonies and other opportunities to run. Sahar Sattarzadeh, finishing her sophomore year in college, must e-mail four essays to professors from the road. The group will share three laptop computers, she says.</td>
