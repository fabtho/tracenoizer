 For MEBDF with error control on constraints the driver is TBAMEBDF. . IVP Software by Jeff Cash Software for Initial Value Problems The code MEBDFDAE is designed to solve stiff initial value problems and differential algebraic equations. Results have also been obtained on some difficult stiff test problems. These can be found in Hairer and Wanner, or on Hairer's home page.</td>

 Use the WebSpectra Search to locate specific types of compounds IR Spectra may be compared in order to illustrate differences in absorption using the WebSpectra IR Comparison. . WebSpectra - Problems in NMR and IR Spectroscopy Problems in NMR and IR Spectroscopy Welcome to WebSpectra - This site was established to provide chemistry students with a library of spectroscopy problems. Interpretation of spectra is a technique that requires practice - this site provides 1H NMR and 13C NMR, DEPT, COSY and IR spectra of various compounds for students to interpret. Hopefully, these problems will provide a useful resource to better understand spectroscopy.</td>

 We'll be happy to include new material, especially links to other on-line material. . Model Problems in Software Architecture The software architecture community would benefit from sharing a set of standard example problems. These would improve our ability to work out ideas, exhibit techniques, and compare results. The Composable Systems Group at Carnegie Mellon has been assembling such a collection of problems.</td>
