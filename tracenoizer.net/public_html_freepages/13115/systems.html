 . Although precise definitions vary, many now recognize that "sustainability" also requires both an institutional structure and a culture capable of achieving these bottom line results in an ongoing fashion. If this is so, the conventional debate will obviously need to push much deeper in order to confront the underlying design characteristics of these and other systems to see if any are--or might be--sustainable. ..</td>

 None of the information provided in this tutorial is part of the content of our seminars. Our tutorial content is good, but our seminar content is AWESOME. Remember, we specialize in providing real, solid insider information on telephone systems that cannot be gained through researching the web or by any other means that we are currently aware of. We'll provide you with the best knowledge in the business on phone systems. Are Business Telephone Systems Going To Be Obsolete Soon.</td>

 This bulletin summarizes lessons learned from SPMN Focus Team visits with many different software-intensive development programs in all three Services. Focus Team support also includes follow-up assistance to the government project office and the contractor to put in place those changes to practices desired by their program managers. Systems Engineering on Embedded Weapon System Programs Systems engineering practices followed on many embedded weapon system development programs are less rigorous and less complete than software engineering practices. The result is that the software development part of system development begins with inconsistent, incomplete, needlessly risky, and highly volatile specifications. A partial list of systems engineering problems observed on more than one program follows.</td>
