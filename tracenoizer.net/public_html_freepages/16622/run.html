 Why does the Installer bomb with an unimplemented trap error when I try to install to my 2GB disk. Why does my IIcx hang configuring the ADB without a keyboard and mouse attached. Even though I have 32-bit mode enabled on my IIsi, I'm told during boot that it can't run with the current memory mappings, and that I should turn 32-bit addressing on in the Memory control panel. After upgrading everything but my X server, I get strange error messages about fonts. My machine hangs when I try to shut it down or reboot it.</td>
