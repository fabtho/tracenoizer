 Is there any way I can prevent this annoying filesystem damage. Does anyone have an Apple StyleWriter-series printer working. Whenever I telnet into my Mac running NetBSD from a machine running MacOS, SunOS, or Solaris, I have severe terminal emulation problems. 2 always crash with an Unimplemented Trap system error. Why won't the Installer utility recognize and mount my NetBSD partition.</td>

 11 After changing kernels, I get a "proc size mismatch" error when I try to use ps. 12 Whenever I make extensive use of the serial ports, I get a lot of fifo overruns. 17 Whenever I telnet into my Mac running NetBSD from a machine running MacOS, SunOS, or Solaris, I have severe terminal emulation problems. 2 always crash with an Unimplemented Trap system error. 20 Now that I've added an ethernet card right next to my video card, why does MacBSD refuse to boot.</td>
