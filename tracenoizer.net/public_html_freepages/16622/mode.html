 One very easy way to learn about vi is to use the 'learn' command available on some systems. This is not a complete training on the use of the editor just a survival quide. The most important thing to remember about vi is that it has three "modes" a "move around mode", an "edit mode", and a "command mode". ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- .

 In effect, it is like going to the stacks and finding your book, then looking around to see what is shelved near it. But unlike the real shelf, even books that are currently checked out will be there, and you will see the items available in more than 20 branches of the UW Libraries. Basic Searching Mode Willow has a Basic Searching mode, which is designed especially for use with library catalogs. With these databases, many users want to look up a known book or author. In this case the Willow Search screen can be confusing, and it provides more power than necessary.</td>

 Why does the Installer bomb with an unimplemented trap error when I try to install to my 2GB disk. Why does my IIcx hang configuring the ADB without a keyboard and mouse attached. Even though I have 32-bit mode enabled on my IIsi, I'm told during boot that it can't run with the current memory mappings, and that I should turn 32-bit addressing on in the Memory control panel. After upgrading everything but my X server, I get strange error messages about fonts. My machine hangs when I try to shut it down or reboot it.</td>
