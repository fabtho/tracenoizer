 In addition, we offer links to more Problems of the Week administered by others, including the challenging college-level problems of Macalester College. . Problem-solving and mathematical communication are key elements of every problem. The Math Forum's Library of Problems of the Week organizes the archives of these six services for browsing by mathematics and story topic, rates problems for difficulty level, and provides for searching by keyword. A new resource for teachers is the Math Forum's Problems of the Week Book, Volume 1.</td>

 The outcome of the day was the identification of specific initiatives and plans to develop them. . Problem based learning (PBL) has been spreading over the last two decades from its origins in the health sciences where it was introduced over thirty years ago. It has become a widespread and widely debated curriculum model. The Generic Centre is leading an attempt to map and share knowledge about PBL much more widely.</td>

 I listed a dozen items, including the latest Patricia Cornwell thriller, a Beatles CD and three "Star Trek" movies, but for some reason I couldn't manage a single trade in a month. (During the same time, I traded five CDs on MrSwap. ) Part of the problem could be that WebSwap requires a one-for-one swap with whoever wants your stuff, making it harder to find a match. I'm getting so bold that I'm thinking of doing an auction or two. Maybe my day job hasn't sapped my adventurous spirit after all.</td>
