Harun Farocki's challenging documentaries take an unorthodox look at European life By Steven A. via Godmilow's short "What Farocki Taught" than for the four documentaries just released on video by Facets. The latter is meant to bear out the former's provocative contention that the 17th-century Dutch still life, by turning from religious subjects to fetishizing quotidian objects, paved the way for modern consumerism.
