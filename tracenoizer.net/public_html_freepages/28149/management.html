<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" When a new program or innovation appears to have the potential to become part of an individual's life, then stage 1, or informational concerns, become uppermost. These concerns relate to an interest in acquiring information about the innovation. For instance, when a secondary school administrator telephones the office of the secondary school principals' association and makes inquiries about school-based management and how it works, this exemplifies informational concerns about the innovation of school-based management. As informational concerns develop, stage 2 personal concerns become highly predictable. The introduction of shared decision-making, for example, generally stimulates personal concerns for both school-based administrators and teachers as they contemplate how their current roles and relationships may change as a result of the new decision-making process.">

 The aim a customer sees (actually it's better phrased as an inference made about the values of the company) is different. Now the linkage is that if the articulated aim and the customer's perceptions of values is hugely different, that should be a signal that the company is not using it's aim as a signpost on the door.
