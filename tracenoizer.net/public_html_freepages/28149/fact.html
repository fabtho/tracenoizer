 That does not apply to an occasions where an assembly sent two men to a special mission, nor when the assembly in Jerusalem chose the seven men who were to serve as social welfare distributors. There were no "ranks" among the early saints; those are a catholic invention. htm which shows that even some catholic writers admit that fact. Please also note, concerning the noun diakonos, that the Greek text of Acts 6 does not use that word about the social welfare distributors who are mentioned there. Those three words were all used interchangeably of elders.</td>

 Because the Bible says one thing, and the churches of this world another, what follows below, will most likely be quite overwhelming for many people. The reader is asked to read on and study these things carefully. In fact, anyone who does not yet understand that the old covenant is ended and is no more, is asked to save this present document for later reading and to read those other ones first.

Opinion As was stated above, Sextus describes a difference between the "clear fact," which is always true, and opinion. These clear facts "are the foundation and cornerstone" of the truth and falsehood of opinion. The exact way in which clear facts related to truth and falsehood, as presented by Sextus, is somewhat confusing.</td>
