 . Rossetti as an illustrator Rossetti as an illustrator The Palace of Art Rossetti made very few book illustrations, but those he produced had an important influence on book illustration during the 1860s and afterwards. He designed five pictures for the Moxon Tennyson (a book which incidentally can still be found in its second edition in second-hand bookshops). He produced a single illustration for Allingham's The Music Master, which also contains one picture by Arthur Hughes and six by John Everett Millais. Apart from these, Rossetti drew four illustrations for works of poetry by his sister, Christina Rossetti.</td>

 . Lee Allen, a former ophthalmic illustrator and an associate in the University of Iowa department of ophthalmology for more than 60 years, has put his drawing skills and first-hand experience with AMD to use to help people better understand the disease. The book was published in May by Penfield Press and is designed to aid patients, their families, ophthalmologists and other eye care professionals. Book proceeds will provide support to the UI Center for Macular Degeneration, which is dedicated to identifying a cure for age-related macular degeneration by altering its onset and reducing the risk of blindness. The disease results in atrophy, or degeneration, of the macula, where the best central vision is located.</td>

 Kinky clothes formerly seen only within sexual subcultures are now worn by club kids and socialites alike. Hitherto secret sexual practices (sexual fetishism, sadomasochism, and transvestism) have become increasingly visible throughout popular culture. In fact, a whole new generation of ab exercises and machines have advanced abdominal workouts to new levels of sophistication, designed for maximum efficiency to provide the trim, toned midsection that everyone wants. But how do you put the exercises together into a routine for your specific physique and needs. Say the word penis often enough and not only will you no longer choke on it, but you may even be able to write a report about the male member that gets straight to the point.</td>
