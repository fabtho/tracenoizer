 The Group calls this approach in which the focus is on reaching a detailed understanding of process chemistry mechanisms, Molecular Process Technology. . The Process Chemistry Group is based in the Faculty's two buildings (Gadolinia and Axelia), but it also has operations in the Turku Technology Centre (DataCity). All work is concerned with detailed physico-chemical processes in complex environments of industrial interest, aiming to find novel solutions to industrial processes and products. The Group calls this approach in which the focus is on reaching a detailed understanding of process chemistry mechanisms, Molecular Process Technology.</td>

Center for Process Analytical Chemistry, Washington University The objective of the Center for Process Analytical Chemistry (CPAC) is to develop real-time measurement and relevant data handling techniques. Through its consortium of industrial sponsors and several national laboratories and government agencies, CPAC addresses challenges in monitoring production processes for effective modeling and control.</td>

 Implement model identification and controller design by using MATLAB software. . Develop statistical process and quality control methods for a single variable, for processes with time dependent data, and for multivariable processes. This represents a significant advance over the one developed last semester and includes detailed process descriptions, downloadable reports and simulation input files and calculators and animations and for them to check out the website here - Larry T. edu) and ASU's Extended Campus beginning on January 17, 2001.</td>
