 Students were given printouts of texts from the Corvey belle-lettres microfiche, and supported through the seminars in exploring the context surrounding the creation and reception of these texts. This included introductions to online resources on Romantic-era literature. Students had to present their research findings in the seminars, and produce a portfolio of written work. Students can access information about women writers on the Corvey Women Writers on the Web database. The database's contents have been written by the project researchers, with some contributions from outside academics.</td>
