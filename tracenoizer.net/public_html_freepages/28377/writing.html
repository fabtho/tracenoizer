 The tutor feels that this is primarily because the students can become very involved in their topic, as they have the potential to do original research. An informal interview with ASTER and some of the students taking the course confirmed most of these findings. The students were also asked if the prospect of their writing being published on the Web influenced their work - they all stated that they primarily aimed to produce the best standard of writing irrelevant of its being put on the Web, though some found the possibility of their work being open to public criticism a little daunting. The Explorations module took up more staff time both in preparing material for students, and delivering the course (students taking Adopt an Author largely work independently). Although the module provided a guided introduction to research methods, some of the students found the shift towards independent learning challenging.</td>
