 Implement model identification and controller design by using MATLAB software. . Develop statistical process and quality control methods for a single variable, for processes with time dependent data, and for multivariable processes. This represents a significant advance over the one developed last semester and includes detailed process descriptions, downloadable reports and simulation input files and calculators and animations and for them to check out the website here - Larry T. edu) and ASU's Extended Campus beginning on January 17, 2001.</td>

 In this process the cellulosic waste feedstock is first gasified, by catalytic flash pyrolysis, then liquefied in a modified Fischer-Tropsch catalytic reactor. The liquid-fuel product is similar to petroleum refinery-produced diesel oil and No. Depending upon the liquid-fuel conversion yield and feedstock moisture content, a high-quality by-product gas is available for sale or supplementary gaseous fuel is needed to sustain the process. The existing research-scale process development unit has an approximate feedstock capacity of 25 pounds per hour. Arizona State University proposes to construct a pilot-scale unit with a feedstock capacity of 10 tons per day.</td>

Center for Process Analytical Chemistry, Washington University The objective of the Center for Process Analytical Chemistry (CPAC) is to develop real-time measurement and relevant data handling techniques. Through its consortium of industrial sponsors and several national laboratories and government agencies, CPAC addresses challenges in monitoring production processes for effective modeling and control.</td>
