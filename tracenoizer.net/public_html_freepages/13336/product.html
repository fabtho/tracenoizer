<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" While unveiling the new products, O'Shea mentioned that Lucent rationalized its way out of the fixed wireless, cable access and small competitive local exchange carrier optical systems businesses, the latter of which represents the shuttered Chromatis operations. The TMX 880, which will ship in January complete with OC-192 interfaces, is intended to migrate those 30 or so service providers to an MPLS core faster than Lucent's MSC 25000 would, but still handle ATM traffic natively. Lucent killed the MSC 25000 earlier this year before shipping the product. For the optical core, Lucent has three new long-haul systems on tap for next year. LambdaManager is a terabit-capacity TDM system for managing "sub-wavelength" or eletronic traffic in ring or mesh networks.">
