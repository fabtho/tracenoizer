 " - David Bohm - Wholeness and the Implicate Order Whole System Glossary under construction. . Whole Systems This area is devoted to the study of whole systems. A whole system view would include all the factors involved and examine how they relate to each other and how they work as a whole. To deal with a whole system we can't leave anything out as irrelevant.</td>

 The field developed initially from the work of Jay W. His seminal book Industrial Dynamics (Forrester 1961) is still a significant statement of philosophy and methodology in the field. Since its publication, the span of applications has grown extensively and now encompasses work in corporate planning and policy design public management and policy biological and medical modeling energy and the environment theory development in the natural and social sciences dynamic decision making complex nonlinear dynamics What is the relationship of System Thinking to System Dynamics Systems thinking looks at exactly the same kind of systems from the same perspective. But it rarely takes the additional steps of constructing and testing a computer simulation model, and testing alternative policies in the model. What is the System Dynamics Society The System Dynamics Society is an international, nonprofit organization devoted to encouraging the development and use of systems thinking and system dynamics around the world.</td>
