In fact it has been used to address practically every sort of feedback system. While the word system has been applied to all sorts of situations, feedback is the differentiating descriptor here.

For Mac OS, we add the search results for the incorrect but common spelling "MacOS". Because Mac OS X is sometimes abbreviated to simply "OS X", the Mac OS X search is just for "OS X" -- we have not found other instances of this term on the web, so we can use it without confusion.</td>
