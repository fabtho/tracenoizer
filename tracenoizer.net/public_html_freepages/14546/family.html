I must start this by saying that even though I had several complications with my pregnancy I always viewed it as a positive experience and I enjoyed it, discomforts and all. I was diagnosed at 18 weeks with having gestational diabetes, I was tested early as I have a strong family history. I ended up taking a very large amount of insulin to control it and did very well at managing my numbers. Mommy talks about me all the time on the preemie BB.">

Here is a list of Kings (and one Queen) of Scotland in the period leading up to King Robert the Bruce. According to Who's Who the Earl's full name is Andrew Douglas Alexander Thomas Bruce.</td>
