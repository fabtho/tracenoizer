<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" Mommy is Due mid February but will be having baby sometime in January. I must start this by saying that even though I had several complications with my pregnancy I always viewed it as a positive experience and I enjoyed it, discomforts and all. I was diagnosed at 18 weeks with having gestational diabetes, I was tested early as I have a strong family history. I ended up taking a very large amount of insulin to control it and did very well at managing my numbers. Mommy talks about me all the time on the preemie BB.">

 Because I run my own practice, I take personal responsibility for anyone who walks through my door. I feel that I should be providing you with more, even if it's just a small thing, like spending more time to make sure you're comfortable with the process. My experience, successful case history, and my reputation around Edmonton are your assurance that your settlement will be both fair and timely. From the first phone call to the last hand shake, I'll give you more. If the settlement figure is the only question (with most of my clients, this is the case), I will advance you a portion of your future settlement if you require it.</td>
