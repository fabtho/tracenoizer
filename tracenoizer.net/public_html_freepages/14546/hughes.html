 Over the years, he picked up many skills totally unmarketable to normal employers - namely playing several instruments and songwriting. . A traditional bagpiper and a rock drummer seem like an odd combination - but this is the origin of Hughes of Green. Incorporating traditional Celtic instruments, such as the pennywhistle and uilleann bagpipes, into a rock sound gives Hughes of Green a unique sound and an ability to expand on their roots. "Doing what we're doing allows us quite a bit of flexibility," says Nate.</td>

 Col CLARK (according to DRAPER)had property on the Pacolet River during the early settlement of upstate SC--Jeremiah STOKES owned property on the Pacolet before 1790. . I don't know if any of the notes are connected to mine; however, I do have some records on a James John HUGHES who might be in the area of early STOKES in SC. I've been looking at a Peter GREEN with son William GREEN in the same area as William WADLINGTON. There was a Loyalist Thomas WATERS whose confiscated estate was given to Col.</td>
