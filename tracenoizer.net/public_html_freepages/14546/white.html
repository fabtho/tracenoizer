 Their relatives are geese, swans and other ducks such as the khaki, campbell, and the rouen. I chose the mallard because they are cute and colorful. The drake has a green head, a white stripe around his neck, a light brown chest and a blue patch on his wing called a speculum. A mallard usually grows to be about 20 to 28 inches with a wingspan of about 30 to 40 inches. Drakes look like their mother when they are born, but look like their father as they grow up.</td>

 Scottish nobles owned lands in both Scotland and England, and were divided in their loyalties to such and extent that now they fought on one side, now on the other. His reign ended in disgrace when he submitted himself as a vassal to a representative of Edward 1 of England. Dressed in only a shirt and underpants he handed over a white wand signifying the surrender of the kingdom of Scotland to the English King. After three years in an English prison, he was allowed to travel to France. In his baggage was found the royal crown and seal of Scotland, as well as money and gold cups.</td>
