 Mommy is Due mid February but will be having baby sometime in January. I must start this by saying that even though I had several complications with my pregnancy I always viewed it as a positive experience and I enjoyed it, discomforts and all. I was diagnosed at 18 weeks with having gestational diabetes, I was tested early as I have a strong family history. I ended up taking a very large amount of insulin to control it and did very well at managing my numbers. Mommy talks about me all the time on the preemie BB.</td>

 . The genre of highlife is well known worldwide as a catchall category for West African music, but has experienced evolutions and offshoots of its sound. As the title suggests, this collection represents one of the peaks of highlife, when a positive political situation under Kwame Nkrumah and the cross-fertilization of Latin and American jazz styles created a strong popular music scene in the dancehalls of urban, coastal Ghana. The music on this CD contains vocals in local language with the rhythmic and brass elements of big band swing and Afro-Cuban jazz. The vibe is upbeat, and evocative of African swells at the nightclub, hopeful about the evening and the future.</td>
