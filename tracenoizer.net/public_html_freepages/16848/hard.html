 I want to thank my class and their parents for a year filled with joy and fun. This is a group of children any teacher would be proud and honored to teach. Thanks to your hard work, the Spring Fling was a great success. As the year draws to a close, the middle school students are continuing to work hard, much to their displeasure. The Sixth Graders are continuing their geometry unit, and will continue with this until the end of the year.</td>
