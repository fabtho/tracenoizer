 Please be on the lookout for these and encourage them to study and rest up. Discussions of the unusual society described in the book have raised many issues and stretched thinking skills. Their final research papers on well-known artists are due soon. The last few weeks of school will be dedicated to a quick run through some of the principles of chemistry. In regular art classes, they are learning linear perspective.</td>

 The Burds convinced their neighbor, Charlie Chrisman, to open his elegant 1880s Queen Anne to the next gala. Jim began to think the gala should feature some dancing as part of the total re-created experience of a 19th-century ball supper. He had met Bob Skiba by chance at the Minnesota Historical Society, where Jim works in the museum shops and Bob was doing costume research for Silver Moon. Bob and Jenny agreed to teach and lead the dancing. So the planning of more dancing and a longer guest list for Twelfthnight III got underway.</td>
