 Contributors to the buffet whispered to each other about the chances of running low on food, a special concern for the makers of the Twelfthnight cake. Cake supervisor Rebecca Bode had obtained the 1996 Twelfthnight cake recipe from her, and fellow board member Maureen Galvin had baked it according to the directions. In the typical ball of Victorian times, when midnight came after hours of dancing, dining room doors were thrown open to reveal a sumptuous spread to do honor to the hosts and planners. But this year, people just kept arriving, and for a while they seemed not to get enough of the period dances being taught by members of Silver Moon Historic Dance Ensemble. North Star Chapter grand marches at Twelfthnight III and IV.</td>

 For 60 days a voluntary grace period will be in effect. Carraway stresses that the police can and will still pull over vehicles just for the seatbelt violation. Most other Indiana law enforcement agencies will also honor the voluntary grace period, and give out warnings only. However, those who opt not to have the grace period do have the right to begin ticketing now. The State police grace period ends after Labor Day weekend.</td>
