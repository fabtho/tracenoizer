NASA Applied Information Systems Research (AISRP) Applied Information Systems Research (AISR) The AISR program maintains an awareness of emerging technologies applicable to space science disciplines, supports applied research in computer and information systems science and technology to enhance NASA Office of Space Science (OSS) programs, stimulates application development where warranted, and provides for the systems analysis and engineering required to transfer new technology into evolving OSS space science programs through NASA Research Announcements (NRAs). The AISR program sponsors workshops where issues such as standardizing scientific data formats used by space science data systems are discussed by computer science and space science investigators. The NASA Graduate Student Researchers Program (GSRP) provides graduate student support in computer science and information systems research to complement the AISR program investigations.</td>
