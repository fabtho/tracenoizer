 Within an education environment, this allows pupils to access internal curriculum resources from home, which is particularly useful for homework or during periods of extended absence. intY will integrate with an existing Microsoft NT domain, this means that setting up remote accounts on the intY couldn't be easier. The intY synchronises itself with the primary domain controller (the system that contains all the user information on your network) copying across user data if required. ..</td>

 However, many Carnegie Mellon users are not on campus, and many use their own Internet Service Provider. Carnegie Mellon University Libraries and Computing Services have worked together to provide a proxy service to off-campus users of digital library resources. This enables users to authenticate with their Carnegie Mellon user ID and password. The server then forwards the user's requests to the vendor from a Carnegie Mellon machine. Initial testing has shown this method to work adequately for most databases.</td>
