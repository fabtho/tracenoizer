 . Although gasoline engines have improved a lot, they are still not very efficient at turning chemical energy into mechanical power. In fact, the cooling system on a car driving down the freeway dissipates enough heat to heat two average-sized houses. The primary job of the cooling system is to keep the engine from overheating by transferring this heat to the air, but the cooling system also has several other important jobs. The engine in your car runs best at a fairly high temperature.</td>

 Unfortunately, most cars don't overheat in the winter. . Cooling Systems Cooling System Overview Below is an explanation of this system's operation Visit The Service Department To Submit Your Problem Or Question Click Here For A More Detailed Graphic And Operation Of This System Click Here To Return To The Auto101 Index The Cooling System The purpose of the engine's cooling system is to remove excess heat from the engine, to keep the engine operating at its most efficient temperature, and to get the engine up to the correct temperature as soon as possible after starting. Ideally, the cooling system keeps the engine running at its most efficient temperature no matter what the operating conditions are. As fuel is burned in the engine, about one-third of the energy in the fuel is converted into power.</td>

 The aim is to integrate this model into PowerDOE, the successor of the DOE-2 thermal building simulation model (CBS News, Summer 1994). Reduced Air Transport Traditionally, HVAC systems are designed as all-air systems. Hydronic radiant systems are air-and-water systems that separate the tasks of ventilation and thermal space conditioning by using the primary air distribution to fulfill the ventilation requirements, and the secondary water distribution system to thermally condition the space. These systems reduce the amount of air transported through buildings significantly, because the ventilation is provided by outside air systems without affecting the recirculating air fraction. Radiation provides most of the cooling, using water as the transport medium.</td>
