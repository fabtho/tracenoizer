 Ground-source or water-source heat pumps can be used in more extreme climatic conditions than air-source heat pumps, and customer satisfaction with the systems is very high. . Rheem The Trane Company York International For climates with moderate heating and cooling needs, heat pumps offer an energy-efficient alternative to furnaces and air conditioners. Like your refrigerator, heat pumps use electricity to move heat from a cool space into a warm place (heat pumps powered by natural gas are also commercially available now). During the heating season, heat pumps move heat from the cool outdoors into your warm house; during the cooling season, heat pumps move heat from your cool house into the warm outdoors.</td>

 . However, it has been limited to closely controlled laboratory facilities. Recent measures of body temperature have been shown to closely follow heat production measurements. Body temperature measurements can be easily taken on a frequent basis. This paper discusses the possibility of estimating heat production with body temperature measurements taken at 48-sec intervals.</td>
