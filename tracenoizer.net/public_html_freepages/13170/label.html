 Writing immediately repaints the text using the new alignment. autotrim An int that is 1 when white space is automatically trimmed from both ends of every string read from or written to the text field, and 0 otherwise. background The Color that is used to paint the background of the label. Writing immediately changes the background to the new color. Storing NULL in background is special and means use the background of the nearest component that contains the label and was assigned a background color other than NULL; if no component qualifies the label uses VM.</td>

 This report summarizes the findings of 5 focus groups with intermediaries conducted early in the message development phase. . Nutrition Label Message Testing A first step towards development of label messages was focus groups with consumers on initial ideas. This report presents findings from 9 focus groups with consumers conducted early in the message development phase. Nutrition Label Message Testing - Intermediaries Also, as part of first steps in development of label messages was focus groups with intermediaries on initial ideas of concepts for communication.</td>
