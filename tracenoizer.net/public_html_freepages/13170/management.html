 . My husband and I have a son, age 8 and a daughter, age 4. I've always worked in management development and I've had the pleasure of supporting a variety of groups; Retail Marketing, the Investor Center branches, our 401(k) business and Human Resources. I have had amazing opportunities to move around the company and work in various business units, as well as in corporate functions. BIGGEST PROFESSIONAL ACHIEVEMENT Without a doubt, creating the new Fidelity Manager Training Program.</td>
