 There has been scattered work on the console and TTY layer going on for some time. This project will try to pull it all together into a coherent architecture from which we can generate clean patches for Linus and the core kernel team. The various subsystems are intertwined with the console system. Plus with the new design it is possible to use framebuffer devices without a VT. The console system input system is based solely on the input api.</td>

 We run the main campus Unix cluster (located in Sweet Hall) in support of the University's academic mission, providing over 100 workstations and several compute servers from multiple vendors for use by over 24,500 Stanford users. Leland Systems also manages the computer resources for several more specialized environments which have integrated themselves with our infrastructure services, providing additional services to smaller groups of Stanford users. Announcements In any large system, things are constantly changing. We endeavor to keep our users apprised of the changes which may affect them. Consequently, we generate a fairly large number of announcements.</td>

 Ross Boylan reports that Wine is apt to crash if you install the Microsoft Windows linotype-palatino fonts; if you have these fonts installed and you have problems using Wine, you can edit the fonts. . This document describes the steps needed to use TrueType fonts successfully on your Debian system running XFree86 4. This document was created using the GNU Emacs editor with the PSGML SGML editing mode. It was translated into HTML using the NewbieDoc stylesheet, which is based on the LDP DocBook DTD.</td>
