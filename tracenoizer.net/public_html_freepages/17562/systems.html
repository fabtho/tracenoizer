 Reference Resources This is our site's equivalent of the library Reference Desk. . Leland Systems Stanford University ITSS CCS CSS Leland Systems Announcements . We run the main campus Unix cluster (located in Sweet Hall) in support of the University's academic mission, providing over 100 workstations and several compute servers from multiple vendors for use by over 24,500 Stanford users. Leland Systems also manages the computer resources for several more specialized environments which have integrated themselves with our infrastructure services, providing additional services to smaller groups of Stanford users.</td>
