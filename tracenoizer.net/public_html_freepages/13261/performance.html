 When a query can be evaluated using bounded memory, our algorithm produces an evaluation plan based on constant-sized synopses of the data streams. on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS 2000), November 2000 We study clustering under the data stream model of computation where given a sequence of points, the objective is to maintain a consistently good clustering of the sequence observed so far using little memory and time. High-Performance Clustering of Streams and Large Data Sets In Proc. Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE 2002), February 2002 We give innovative techniques to transform theoretically well-founded algorithms for clustering into ones that perform well in practice. We further show that their performance is competitive with popular empirical approaches for clustering data streams.</td>
