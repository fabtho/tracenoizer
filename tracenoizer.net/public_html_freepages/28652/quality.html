 Wake County, flanked on one side by the Atlantic Coast's sandy beaches and the other side by the picturesque Blue Ridge Mountains, is home to approximately 560,000 residents. Raleigh residents boast of a world-class economic vitality, further boosted by a 1959 State of North Carolina initiative which carved out the now world renowned Research Triangle Park just west of the city. The Greater Raleigh area enjoys a skilled work force, educational opportunity, environmental quality and community quality-of-life. com's North Carolina law firms with Web pages Raleigh North Carolina photo Gallery by Consultwebs.

 While the book is mostly self-contained, people report that it does not serve as an introductory OO text. It helps to have had some previous exposure to basic OO concepts. However, it does not address many nuts-and-bolts issues surrounding the use of real OO languages, tools, and systems for distribution in part because so few of them (of appropriate production quality) were available at the time of writing. While Part II consists largely of OO Design Patterns, they are not phrased as such, mainly because this was written before now-common ideas about presenting, structuring and documenting patterns arose. While there are many things we'd do differently if we were rewriting this book, there are no current plans for a second edition.</td>
