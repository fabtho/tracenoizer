 To provide you with some idea about the steps we had to go through to build CIDS, a flow chart was created. The current version of CIDS contains atmospheric databases focusing on data from the Central Equatorial Pacific Experiment (CEPEX) and the Indian Ocean Experiment (INDOEX). Database Exploration Utilities The list of platform-instrument pairs supported within a CIDS database may be obtained from the Database Browse utility. This utility also provides the ability to view the header information and geographical and time bounds of every entry under a specified platform-instrument pair. Each platform-instrument pair points to a set of unique NetCDF data files that generally correspond to satellite images, aircraft flights, or sounding launches.</td>

 MRDS is an international data base of mineral sites records with related geologic, commodity, and deposit information. New records are continually being added and existing records updated or upgraded. MRDS Database Structure MRDS is a worldwide data base of metallic and industrial mineral sites. Mineral information is stored in records in approximately two hundred data fields. Each record pertains to a location which is usually a site but may also be a mining district or region.</td>

 Data Services at this Node SBN on-line data archives, with immediately downloadable catalogs and datasets for New. The SBDB will eventually allow users to identify objects based on observed properties and to retrieve data relevant to specific selected objects. During the first stage of implementation, each online catalog is ingested into the database and the contents made available for display based on object identification. A cross-identification utility is built into the interface, so that only a single ID need be entered to retrieve all available data relevant to the object. The Test Interface is available for public perusal.</td>
