 . Planetary Data System Home The Planetary Data System (PDS) archives and distributes scientific data from NASA planetary missions, astronomical observations, and laboratory measurements. The PDS is sponsored by NASA's Office of Space Science. Its purpose is to ensure the long-term usability of NASA data and to stimulate advanced research. Additional information is also available in the PDS Annual Report.</td>

 We archive and distribute digital data related to the study of the surfaces and interiors of planetary bodies using active and passive microwave sensing techniques. A variety of Consultation Services are available to assist your work with our current data holdings, and to assist you in preparing new data sets. An article in Science (November 29, 1996) presents evidence for polar ice deposits from a bistatic radar experiment that used signals from the Clementine spacecraft (right). Bistatic observations from the Arecibo Observatory (left) appear to refute this interpretation, but new results from the Neutron Spectrometer instrument abord the Lunar Prospector indicate that hydrogen atoms are present at both lunar poles. The PDS Imaging Node, in collaboration with the Solar System Visualization Project and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Public Information Office, has constructed a Planetary Photojournal -- images of the planets produced by the U.</td>

 . These data are used in statistical early warning models to predict political change. The ten-year project is based in the Department of Political Science at the University of Kansas; it has been funded primarily by the U. The centerpiece of this effort is the KEDS computer program and the new, open-source TABARI program, but we have also produced several programs for filtering texts and aggregating event data. Production of event data sets Using the KEDS and TABARI programs, news reports from the Reuters wire service, and the World Events Interaction Survey (WEIS) event coding scheme, we have produced several event data sets -- primarily for the Middle East -- for the period 1979 to the present.</td>
