 Table showing RAE results for each subject in the University of Sheffield. In the RAE 2001, the research work conducted in every UK university department was rigorously assessed by panels of internationally renowned research experts from universities and industry, none of whom assessed work carried out in their own universities. 5 Quality that equates to attainable levels of international excellence in up to half of the research activity submitted and to attainable levels of national excellence in virtually all of the remainder. 4 Quality that equates to attainable levels of national excellence in virtually all of the research activity submitted, showing some evidence of international excellence. 3a Quality that equates to attainable levels of national excellence in over two-thirds of the research activity submitted, possibly showing evidence of international excellence.</td>

 Research Assessment Exercise Return to History Home Page . . Teaching Assessment St Andrews History Teaching "Excellent" A teaching quality assessment by the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council has awarded the St Andrews University Departments of Mediaeval History, Modern History and Scottish History the highest grade of EXCELLENT.

To return to the service you will need to use the 'Back' button on your Web browser. The research assessments rate the quality of research carried out in government funded higher education institutions. They determine how public funding is allocated selectively for research. The 1996 exercise is now complete, organised jointly by all of the Higher Education Funding Councils in the United Kingdom.</td>
