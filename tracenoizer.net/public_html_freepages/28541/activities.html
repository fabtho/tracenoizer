 3 Notes The County Council has long given high priority to the generation of capital receipts to assist funding of the capital programme. This has been fostered by Government, not only in terms of levels of capital spending approvals but also through concessions in Government financial regulations, in certain classes of cases, in the proportion of capital receipts the County Council may use to supplement spending approvals. 4 A major part, however, of capital receipts has come from the activities of the County Council's industry and town centre development schemes. In the longer term, significant opportunities may be in prospect - eg Roundswell and Skypark. 5 The release of surplus property from the County Council's operational estate has also been affected by changes in the management of schools.</td>
