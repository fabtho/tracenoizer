From that meager start I have spent considerable time and money in assembling the facts which are gathered below.</td>

 While in the Midwest I attended many science fiction conventions, but strangely there aren't many in the Bay Area. I listen to a lot of music, particularly rock and folk music, interspersed with classical. In mid-1998 I also started getting into jazz, with a taste for Miles Davis, Joshua Redman, Thelonious Monk and Sonny Rollins. In the early 90s I became a big baseball fan, with my team being the Boston Red Sox. In California I've attended many San Francisco Giants games, and a few Oakland Athletics games.</td>
