 From his record we find he was 5 feet 10 inches tall, fair complexion, blue eyes and light colored hair. His daughter Sarah must have been conceived during a time of inactivity of the unit, as her birth date falls right in the middle of Wash's time of service. Wash Davis was said to have been a wealthy farmer, and a persistent family rumor is that he was either a second or third cousin to Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Apparently, Wash didn't get along well with his wife Anne's brother Roswell Hart. Roswell was the next youngest child of Henry and Barbara Hart and was a local Union Civil War Hero.</td>
