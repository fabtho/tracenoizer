 The activities of our 58 faculty members reflect the diversity of North Carolina agriculture. They are equally committed to classroom education of agricultural students and to finding new ways that crop plants can benefit North Carolina citizens. In the Department of Crop Science at North Carolina State University, we realize that we must maintain a versatile and responsive educational program to train tomorrow's leading crop scientists. We offer undergraduate and graduate degree programs that answer the need for highly trained individuals at all levels of our occupation. .</td>
