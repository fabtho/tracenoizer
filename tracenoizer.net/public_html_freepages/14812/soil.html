 Drought stress can begin in as little as three days after a 1-inch rain or irrigation in such crops as tomatoes in soils like those in the Piedmont of North Carolina. Thus, frequent irrigation is necessary for maximum yield. Soil moisture requirements differ with the crop and stage of crop development. Soil moisture availability varies with the amount of water in the soil and the type of soil. Soil type is very important in planning for and using an irrigation system.</td>
