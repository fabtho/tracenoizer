 An overview of the program would not be complete without mentioning that by cooperating with the education department of the Roundabout Theatre, some of these students, who would not otherwise have the immediate opportunity to attend a live Broadway performance, do so. One of the objectives is to develop theatre appreciation from an early age so the seed is sown for a lifetime of theatre-going pleasure. In the first year, approximately 25 students participated in the program. This year we are happy to be joined by 17 new ESL students. The theatre performances will greatly enliven the language experience of our ESL students.</td>
