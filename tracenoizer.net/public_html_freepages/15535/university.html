 . The History of Shakespeare at Winedale The History of Shakespeare at Winedale Shakespeare at Winedale began as an English Department course in 1970. As the program grew in size and reputation, it began to attract students from outside the English Department and eventually beyond the University of Texas. In 1998, Shakespeare at Winedale undertook its first international venture, as a specially selected group of former students traveled to London to perform by invitation at Shakespeare's Globe Theatre. We have also been involved in exchanges with British actors, directors and scholars.</td>

 Seven entrants from seven different countries in the Asia Pacific region were selected and their proposals are currently under deliberation with the date set for the launch of the Project- July 30, 2001. But promoting seven artists and seven viewpoints is, of course, not the only objective of FOCUS. 01, faculties from the University of the Philippines College of Fine Arts were invited. Five experts in the fields of the Studio Arts, Art Theory, Art Criticism and History, and Visual Communication were given the task of looking into the proposals for FOCUS. For many of these members in the proposal deliberations, it is a first time to be intimately involved in the pre-production and conceptual stage of new media art.</td>
