 The Forum also offers the speakers a chance to experience the vibrancy of life on this campus. Speakers routinely express their gratitude for the opportunity to have discussions with students and faculty members about the work that they do and their perceptions of the fields of interests of the guests. Since many Forum speakers are national and international policy makers, gathering thoughts and suggestions from the Colleges community aids in their future work. The President's Forum Series will continue to bring important politicians, intellectuals, and social activists to campus - allowing the community the continual flow and exchange of ideas. .</td>
