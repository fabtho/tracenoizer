 . ------------------------------------------------------- This will be an interesting and enjoyable symposium, very different from most others, in a beautiful quiet place. It will be a landmark in the further development of medical practice and science and for solving the crisis in health care delivery. It will provide guidance and knowledge of how medicine can develop to a more efficient and thought out enterprise. Participation fee is reduced if registration is done before 1 July 1997.</td>
