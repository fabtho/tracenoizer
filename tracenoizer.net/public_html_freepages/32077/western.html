 In addition to this specialisation there is at the same time a general, interdisciplinary interest to show the link between the cultural and historical common ground of the individual Christian Oriental communities. It is therefore the aim of the series to include detailed specialist studies of leading scientists from their relevant fields of research and to offer a forum for interdisciplinary works. The Christian Orient played a significant role in the cultural history of the European East Orient and provided western cultures with a rich heritage. In order to reveal this importance the series also addresses students and the interested public. Considering this setting of priorities the work intends to give the manifold cultural-historical, artistic and philological aspects of the Christian Orient the due respect they deserve.</td>
