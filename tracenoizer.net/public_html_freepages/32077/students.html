 It is therefore the aim of the series to include detailed specialist studies of leading scientists from their relevant fields of research and to offer a forum for interdisciplinary works. The Christian Orient played a significant role in the cultural history of the European East Orient and provided western cultures with a rich heritage. In order to reveal this importance the series also addresses students and the interested public. Considering this setting of priorities the work intends to give the manifold cultural-historical, artistic and philological aspects of the Christian Orient the due respect they deserve.
