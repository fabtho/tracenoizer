 Only the sermons, therefore, remain as the actual works of Tauler. The Cologne edition was translated into or rather paraphrased in, Latin by Laurentius Surius (Cologne, 1548). This Latin edition was the copy used for translations into various foreign languages and for both Catholic and Protestant retranslations into German. Lately, Ferdinand Vetter has prepared an edition (Berlin, 1910) based on the Engelberg manuscript (the only one made at Cologne and the oldest one that may perhaps represent the collection revised by Tauler himself) also on the Freiburg manuscript, and on copies of the three manuscripts burned at Strasburg in 1870. The sermons are among the finest monuments of the German language, of German fervour of belief, and of profound spiritual feeling.</td>
