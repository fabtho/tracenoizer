 A comprehensive list of the publication output, activities such as conferences, workshops and seminars, a full description of the post-graduate Ph. . Established in 1982 as an academic unit it expanded in 1995 into a Research Center, whose goal is to promote research on problems related to enhancing the aspirations of the South to human development and security. Phase II of the research program from 1998-2000 built on the earlier research program under a similar theme and title (reference is made to Publication Catalogue 2001 and Review of Output published separately. This document identifies the research themes in order to chart a common organizing principle of the general theme for the coming research period 2001-2003.</td>

 Chronologically the series covers the early Byzantine Epoch up to the late Middle Ages. In isolated cases it also takes into account contemporary presentations of oriental communities with regard to their roots within a Christian-historical environment. Research of the Christian Orient today takes place in different individual disciplines, each of which concentrates on certain languages or geographic regions. In addition to this specialisation there is at the same time a general, interdisciplinary interest to show the link between the cultural and historical common ground of the individual Christian Oriental communities. It is therefore the aim of the series to include detailed specialist studies of leading scientists from their relevant fields of research and to offer a forum for interdisciplinary works.</td>

 Coast Guard engaged in work for the International Ice Patrol, in addition to his position as a curator and lecturer at the MCZ at Harvard. These experiences allowed Bigelow to develop unique expertise in hydrography. Work with the North American Committee on Fishery Investigation and the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea strengthened Bigelow's research ties to Canada and his friendship with A. This work also brought Bigelow into close contact with European leaders in oceanography and fisheries including Bjorn Helland-Hansen, Johan Hjort, and Johannes Schmidt. In 1927, Bigelow was selected by the National Academy of Sciences to serve as secretary and later chair of their Committee on Oceanography, charged to describe and find means to strengthen oceanographic research in the United States.</td>
