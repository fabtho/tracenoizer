" When asked if Simulcasting was considered art, Lucas said, "Some people think that Simulcasting is art, but the real purpose of Simulcasting is to improve the relationship between art and the audience. " Billed as "Simulcast Convention 2000," Lucas, along with fellow Simulcasters Joe and Sally McKay, led the audience through a workshop with lectures and discussions Thursday evening and Saturday afternoon.

Due to a rain-delay, an extra day was added to finish an extremely exciting race (59 lead changes among 12 drivers in 500 miles). With 950hp Champ Car engines blowing up left and right due to high speeds, only six of 26 cars finished the whole 500 miles.</td>
