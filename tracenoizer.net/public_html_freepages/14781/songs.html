 Their forthcoming CD showcases a mix of contemporary folk and rock, using ethereal harmonies, violin and acoustic guitar to evoke many moods. CJ, along with partner Kate Jordan, released Get Home Early in April 2001. Rick Nestler brings the songs of the sailor to life. He is working on a new album of maritime music to follow up his earlier release, Spending My Days. From New York, he recently debuted with One Way or The Other.</td>

Long before Donna Karan and Calvin Klein infiltrated Secaucus with designer fashions at discounted prices, the blue-collar suburban community was known for its pig farms. Ten years ago, McKay decided to capitalize on his colorful past.</td>
