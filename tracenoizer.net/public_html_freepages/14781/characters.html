com With his pleasing, inviting voice and grassroots folk song style, Joe McKay is reminiscent of your musical Uncle Fred providing a good time at family functions with his singing and playing. McKay doesn't bowl over listeners with breathtaking metaphor or puzzling obliqueness--his songwriting style is fairly straightforward. In this release, we get to know some of the history and characters from a part of New Jersey heretofore unknown to most non-Garden Staters, the farming area around Secaucus. The title cut, "Backroad Joe," brings to mind Tennessee Ernie Ford's hit "16 Tons. " It uncannily depicts the cycle of life of a youth raised on a New Jersey pig farm.</td>

 Christopher Nolan's one-of-a-kind film stars Guy Pearce as Leonard Shelby, a man on a mission to find the thug who supposedly raped and killed his wife. The trouble is that Leonard has lost his short-term memory and must use notes and tattoos to keep track of events, which is unfortunate for him since nothing or nobody is what they seem. The sketchy characters include Teddy and Natalie (played by Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss, both of "The Matrix") who may or not be out to help him. It's disappointing then, that a film of this caliber gets a DVD that lacks any real special features. It is widescreen and contains the usual theatrical trailers and subtitle options, but the extra materials stop there.</td>

 To illustrate this concept she used many Brad Pitt movies. " Using finger-puppets of Bert and Ernie - "the quintessential split personality" - she illustrated a bar scene from the movie "Seven" by acting it out. Miss Mouse used stills from the movies to illustrate her points, as when she spoke of how the characters in "Fight Club" become angry at the world of "rampant consumerism" they live in, and showed a slide of Brad Pitt pointing a gun at someone in front of a Mountain Dew vending machine. " Citing that life was all about the choices you make, Miss Mouse concluded her the presentation with a question for the audience, "Are you a human, or are you a mouse. .</td>
