 Ownership, copyright and title of this folk music CD review belongs to me, Kevin McCarthy. .com With his pleasing, inviting voice and grassroots folk song style, Joe McKay is reminiscent of your musical Uncle Fred providing a good time at family functions with his singing and playing. McKay doesn't bowl over listeners with breathtaking metaphor or puzzling obliqueness--his songwriting style is fairly straightforward. However, he possesses a knack for keenly and sincerely bringing to life people, places and times from throughout his life.</td>

 I picked up the banjo and the guitar and played in several bands. And then I was drafted into the service and went to Vietnam. When I got out of the service I got married and had a family. He worked as a bus driver, a chimney sweep, and a vacuum cleaner salesman. and owns a garbage hauling company called Dumpster Man with his son.</td>
