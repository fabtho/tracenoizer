 Strutting around the Wexner in a jumpsuit with a satellite dish on her back, and a helmet with antennae, Lucas explained Simulcasting as "building a communication system on a very basic level. " When asked if Simulcasting was considered art, Lucas said, "Some people think that Simulcasting is art, but the real purpose of Simulcasting is to improve the relationship between art and the audience. " Billed as "Simulcast Convention 2000," Lucas, along with fellow Simulcasters Joe and Sally McKay, led the audience through a workshop with lectures and discussions Thursday evening and Saturday afternoon. The kit consisted of a protective outer shell, an aluminum foil ball attached to a pipe cleaner, and instructions written in both English and Japanese. " Lucas advised attaching your foil ball to cell phones, computers and to your car, if you want a mobile Simulcasting unit.</td>
