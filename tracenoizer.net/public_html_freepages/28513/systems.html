<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" A gSEE is an environment that can seamlessly support the evolution of a software product from the idea stage through maintenance of an implementation, regardless of the location or number of individuals involved. Such an environment should be able to support the expansion, contraction, and migration of participants in the software process without requiring changes to the environment infrastructure, and thus reducing the impact of changes on the project as a whole. These characteristics make a global software engineering environment ideal for supporting the evolutionary design of complex systems. This standardization is necessary to promote the development of a large number of tools which share these common features, allowing the gSEE to be composed using commercial, off-the-shelf tools and systems rather than just research prototypes. Our work on the WWW standards, in collaboration with the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the Internet Engineering Taskforce (IETF), has included authoring the core protocol specifications for the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI), as well as significant involvement in the specification of the Hypertext Mark-up Language (HTML).">
