 This standardization is necessary to promote the development of a large number of tools which share these common features, allowing the gSEE to be composed using commercial, off-the-shelf tools and systems rather than just research prototypes. Our work on the WWW standards, in collaboration with the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the Internet Engineering Taskforce (IETF), has included authoring the core protocol specifications for the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI), as well as significant involvement in the specification of the Hypertext Mark-up Language (HTML). At present, any web browser can contact any HTTP server, download content, and display it to the user. This should hold true for distributed web content authoring tools. Any authoring tool should be able to contact any write-capable server, and be able to modify content on that server (provided the user has appropriate access permissions).</td>
