 The content of the information does not necessarily reflect the position or the policy of the Government and no official endorsement should be inferred. . A gSEE is an environment that can seamlessly support the evolution of a software product from the idea stage through maintenance of an implementation, regardless of the location or number of individuals involved. Such an environment should be able to support the expansion, contraction, and migration of participants in the software process without requiring changes to the environment infrastructure, and thus reducing the impact of changes on the project as a whole. These characteristics make a global software engineering environment ideal for supporting the evolutionary design of complex systems.</td>
