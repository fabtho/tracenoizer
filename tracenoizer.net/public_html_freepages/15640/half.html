 It came up two games short, losing 5-1 to Rifle in the first round of the Class 4A Region 1 Tournament at Englewood. "It's disappointing to get this far and not advance, but we lost 10 seniors from last year's team," Central head coach Ken Ramos said. "This was basically our JV team from last year, and I expected us to win half our games.

Chris Brown finally ended the shutout in the bottom of the seventh, driving in Josh Borunda for the only Central run.</td>
