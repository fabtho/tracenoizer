<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" While field burning benefited growers, residents complained when smoke drifted into populated areas. Public debate over field burning lasted for decades. It came to a head in 1988 when a smoke-related accident on Interstate 5 led to legislation that severely limited the use of fire on grass seed fields. With more than 20 years of research to draw on, OSU Extension staff and researchers mobilized to help grass seed growers meet the field burning phase down mandated by the Oregon legislature. Through on-farm demonstration projects and other educational efforts, growers learned about alternatives to field burning that contributed to a significant reduction in acreage burned while maintaining yield, seed quality, and profitability.">
