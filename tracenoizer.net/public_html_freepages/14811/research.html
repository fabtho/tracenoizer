 ARD scientists explore scientific frontiers, add to the world's scientific knowledge and work to improve life for all Nebraskans. . Every day, in many ways, our Research Division scientists pioneer the future. A team of NU Institute of Agriculture and Natural Resources researchers is examining the industry's economic, physical and social impacts on longtime residents and Hispanic immigrants in three Nebraska communities. This research should help other Great Plains' towns facing rapid demographic changes.</td>
