 Various styles, most of them are rhythm based and quite extreme, and lots of DIY releases. All these years KGB has been a unit that mostly deals with trades, rather than money. org site, which, up to now, is only in Greek (there is a plan for an English version in the near future). First motive on releasing my sounds was need for communication, sharing my ideas and music. Right now, the only thing I believe about music is that we always got to move forward, to create free-of-forms (forms that have been established through the music industry), to experiment and expand our listening possibilities (and widen our frequency-range.</td>

 First of all, I must tell you that the only thing we're after is the special moments that come out time to time when we play live together. I think it's impossible to record the magic of these moments on any audio or video tape. I feel that a musical performance has nothing to do with the past or the future and I'm not even sure that it's appropriate to record it. But regarding to your question, I must also tell you that the Sierra Studios in Athens is one of the best places on this planet for attempting a recording session. If yes please provide some details, like when it starts with which bands etc.</td>

 It is normal and appropriate that at such times the military is elevated to the highest level of respect and support. Objectives such as correcting military helicopter routes to reduce civilian impacts must be set aside. Accordingly, MARCH has placed its efforts on hold for the indefinite future. We have received a few emails and you have probably seen letters printed in the newspapers celebrating the silence of those who have 'whined' about Miramar helicopter noise. We have nothing to learn from those who would exploit the September 11 tragedy in order to score rhetorical points by bashing others who have justifiably criticized military Commanders for decisions which are now of secondary importance.</td>
