 This database returns my home address, phone number, and information about my neighbors gleaned from the phone book records. As a test I typed my name into a standard search engine. The reason, of course, is that the search engine was unable to enter the AnyWho database to retrieve my personal information. Although my personal information is available on the free web, it was inaccessible to the search engine. On a more complex and comprehensive scale, this is why much of the web is invisible.</td>
