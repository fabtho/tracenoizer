 Differences in the thermal behavior of the two materials caused by differences in specific heat, occurrence of an exothermic or endothermic reaction, or a phase change result in a temperature difference between the two crucibles. Pt-10Rh differential thermocouple, permit properties of the unknown to be determined relative to that of the standard. Simultaneously, any change in mass of the specimen during a heating cycle can be measured with a microbalance as a function of temperature. During the thermal cycle, a capillary leak allows samples of the gaseous environment in the immediate vicinity of the specimen to be drawn into a quadruple mass spectrometer. Evolved gases can thus be identified by the mass-charge ratios of molecules, fragments, or atoms in the gas.</td>

 have some well-defined contracts since they were designed to be overridden. It is the responsibility of any class overriding the Object class to obey these contracts. If these contracts are broken, various other classes that depend on these contracts will not function properly in conjunction with the class. This section details rules that have to be followed while overriding some of these well-known methods. 8 Obey the rules when overriding the Equals() method 9 Always override the GetHashCode() method when you override the Equals() method 10 Always override the ToString() method 11 Consider implementing the IComparable interface 12 Ensure all fields are covered when you overload the IClonable.</td>

 , hard hammer biface edging versus soft hammer biface thinning). Application of mass analysis to flake debris from controlled experimental reductions often provides the baseline for the interpretation of archaeological samples. Following this, a multivariate statistical method known as discriminant function analysis is conducted to determine the best way to separate the different experimental reductions based on the mass analysis variables. Even without the use of an experimental assemblage, mass analysis can provide general indications of the technologies present. Several general trends have been noted in mass analysis experiments (e.</td>
