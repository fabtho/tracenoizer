 . The flakes in each size grade are then counted, weighed and the number of cortical flakes recorded for raw material and provenience (i. This raw data is then used to determine a series of new variables (percentage of flakes in each size computed over all sizes, percentage of weight in each size computed over all sizes, average weight of flakes in each size grade, and the percentage of cortical flakes in each size) to be used in the analysis. , percussor used, placement of load) in the flintknapping procedure produces corresponding variations in flake size and shape. These observations build on principles of fracture mechanics.</td>

 Total failure of an FTS is extremely rare at either range, and destruct commands are often superfluous because vehicles explode or break up because of dynamic forces before the mission flight control officer (MFCO) can react. TRACKING A large fraction of range support costs are related to de- veloping, maintaining, and operating accurate and reliable tracking systems. EWR 127-1 requires "at least two adequate 26 and independent instrumentation data sources" for tracking launch vehicles "from T-0 throughout each phase of pow- ered flight up to the end of range safety responsibility" (Para- graph 2. For space launch vehicles, the ER implements this requirement by mandating two independent tracking sources and full FTS capability from launch through normal engine shutdown subsequent to achieving orbit. The WR re- quires two independent tracking sources and FTS capability until loss of contact with the vehicle as it approaches and passes over the horizon.</td>
