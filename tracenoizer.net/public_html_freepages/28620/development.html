 The approach still uses the Jini technology principle of mobile objects, but it makes sure that the objects are moved in the right direction. Elsewhere, developers in the especially dynamic distributed-services environment, who are already dealing with a number of decisions relating to appropriate software design at the client end, will have to rethink the ways they upload and download programs into microcontroller flash memory. A venerable development methodology that may end up on the dust heap is in-system programming. Embedded developers use ISP to store application code in a system in a form that can be modified and updated. But in the constantly connected environment, the need to go off line with ISP to reprogram the flash memory is no longer practical.</td>
