 A mass spectrometer (MS) is attached to the STA instrument for evolved gas analysis. The Stanton Redcroft STA shown above operates in a manner similar to a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). Two sample crucibles are heated or cooled at a precisely controlled rate in a controlled environment. One crucible contains a standard of known thermal response; the unknown is placed in the second crucible. Differences in the thermal behavior of the two materials caused by differences in specific heat, occurrence of an exothermic or endothermic reaction, or a phase change result in a temperature difference between the two crucibles.</td>

 No matter what language the application maintained on the client or the server, what the programmer now sees is a common mechanism for delivery of services, based on the Extensible Markup Language (XML) and the Simple Object Access Protocol (Soap). Despite the hint of fractures already appearing in this emerging framework as rivals craft uninteroperable versions, many believe the Web-services idea holds promise as a means to at least do a quick repair job with the programming equivalent of duct tape. But a services environment is only one of a number of issues that must be resolved if engineers and software developers are to be assured their designs will work correctly in a net-centric world, according to several contributors to this week's Focus section on programming the Web. According to Kelvin Nilsen, CTO and founder of Newmonics Inc. ), a single Java implementation may not be suitable in the diverse telecom, datacom and networking environment.</td>

 Existing PHP applications can be quickly key-enabled. php is a web based editor for quick development of server side code. It offers a rapid prototyping environment to test and save snippets of code with minimal overhead. This content management package allows you to create, modify and maintain dynamic database-enabled web services. The package also features list filtering and sorting.</td>
