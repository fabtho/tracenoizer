 . Little is known about the pathogenesis of these diseases for the following reasons. The reasons that we have accumulated so little information in this regard is that the research efforts have been hampered for twenty years by investigations limited to the 'prion'. This altered host protein , in my opinion, is a reaction product of the infection; yet, most monies committed to research on TSE has essentially been limited to studies of this protein. 3) Prion researchers have admitted that another factor is involved.</td>
