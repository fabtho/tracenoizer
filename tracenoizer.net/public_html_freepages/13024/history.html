 .00 Nathan Bastian lives in Boston MA, working full time as a freelance artist. For the last eight years he has also been teaching Art and Art History for the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. His work is a combination of traditional and contemporary styles and techniques drawing its inspiration from such varied sources as the religion and art of ancient Egypt, the works of artists such as Michelangelo and Vincent VanGogh and the experiences, observations and passions of his own life.
