 We are actively studying how new movements are "learned" and what the course of movement recovery following different types brain damage is. Much of our work has focused on understanding how damage to the cerebellum causes movement incoordination or "ataxia. " Our research suggests that one important role of the cerebellum is to adjust the motor output controlling a given part of the body to compensate for mechanical effects caused by movement of other body parts (interaction torques). Our current studies of people with cerebellar damage are aimed at understanding the mechanisms of walking ataxia, motor learning deficits, and impairments in motor 'automaticity'. We are also studying the movement disorders and treatments associated with Parkinson's disease and cerebral palsy.</td>
