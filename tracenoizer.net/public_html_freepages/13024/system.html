 When I saw that I could not get enough on the cart I asked him (and Carl but we did not come to an agreement) to participate. What have you been doing during the last few years since completing SIMIS. Currently I am programming a real-time operating system for different processores (ARM,Mcore,V850,SH2). Someone who may have helped you technically or supported you through your hard work. A big thankyou goes also the Harry Dodgson, with whom I share the Lynx hobby now for over 7 years.</td>

 VSCRA The Vintage Sailboard Racing Association is dedicated to bring back the sport of sailboard racing. That's SAILBOARD RACING, not some Formula that "simplifies" things by requiring specialized gear and stupid big sails. VSCRA also pioneered the sailor weight habdicapping system that allows sailors of varying weights to race against eachother on equal ground. VSCRA racing is the most fun you can have on an old piece of junk longboard. OK, its the only fun you can have on an old piece of junk longboard.</td>
