2 (See bottom for change history) In this paper I would like to bring the attention to an important performance bottleneck in the ld. so currently does a fine job for the things it was designed. The problem is that it wasn't designed for todays Linux Desktop. Slow is a very subjective term, but when it comes to a graphical user interface, things are typically perceived as slow when there is a latency of more than 0. So if I click on a button, it should bring up a window on my screen within 0.</td>
