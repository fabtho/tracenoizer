 Global Greens exposes the behind the scenes efforts of these well funded and ideologically driven groups. . CRC Researcher Ivan Osorio looks at organized labor's senior lobby's funding by taxpayers CRC Research Associates Bill Lickert and Chris Morris examine Enron's relationship with the environmental movement in National Review Online The media are looking avidly for any signs that collapsed-energy-giant Enron may have had undue influence over the Bush administration's energy policy. They're also completely ignoring Enron's involvement with environmental-activist groups prior to President Bush's tenure. Bill Lickert and Chris Morris look at the close relationship Enron had with environmentalists during the Clinton years in this commentary that also is running today on National Review Online.</td>
