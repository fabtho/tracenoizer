 We're pleased that our two flagship products, WebSite and WebBoard, have found new homes and will continue to be developed and supported. . WebSite lead developer Bob Denny will continue development of the product, now named Deerfield WebSite. In 1994, Denny created the original 16-bit server for Windows 3. O'Reilly will no longer sell or support WebSite Professional.</td>

 . The Apache Software Foundation provides support for the Apache community of open-source software projects. The Apache projects are characterized by a collaborative, consensus based development process, an open and pragmatic software license, and a desire to create high quality software that leads the way in its field. We consider ourselves not simply a group of projects sharing a server, but rather a community of developers and users. You are invited to participate in The Apache Software Foundation.</td>
