 Associated with the Aeronautical Science and Technology Group, is the William H. Avery Advanced Technology Development Laboratory (AATDL) - formerly the Propulsion Research Laboratory. The Avery Laboratory fostered the development of dual and supersonic combustion scramjets, and is a nationally unique facility for testing high-speed propulsion systems. Aeronautics APL's aeronautical science and technology work focuses on advanced propulsion and power systems. As a pioneer in the development of high-speed guided missile systems for the Navy and Army, APL has worked to perfect advanced material systems able to withstand rapid heating rates and high structural temperatures.</td>
