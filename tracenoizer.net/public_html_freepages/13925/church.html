 St Canice had studied in Wales at St Cadoc in Liancarvan and, later, at the monastery St Finian founded at Clonard. Canice, along with Mobhi, Columcille and Comgall, then went to Scotland where Mobhi founded a monastery on the banks of the River Tolka at Giasnevin. Fr McGough was faced with many challenges in the early months of his tenure at Katoomba, such as the indifference of local Catholics to going to church. Even when the bishop visited, Fr McGough could think of barely 10 parishioners who would want to attend Mass.
