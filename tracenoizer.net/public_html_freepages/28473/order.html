 University Housing will send you a contract upon your admission to the University as long as space remains available. Typically, students admitted as late as March 15 receive housing contracts. At the time assignments are made, in late May, all returned housing contracts are randomly sorted by computer to rank students in the order they will be assigned to residence halls. A myriad of privately owned housing abounds within easy walking distance of campus buildings. They are located adjacent to campus and stay actively connected to University events and resources.</td>
