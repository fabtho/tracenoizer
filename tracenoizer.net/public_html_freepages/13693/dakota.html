 12(b)(v) should be granted only if it is disclosed with certainty the impossibility of proving a claim upon which relief can be granted. When reviewing the motion, the court must construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and the allegations of the complaint must be taken as true. " However, in North Dakota proof of actual damage proximately caused by a misrepresentation or nondisclosure is an essential element of a tort action for fraud and deceit. A fraud or deceit which has caused no injury cannot be made the basis for an action, because courts do not "'sit for the purpose of enforcing moral obligations or correcting unconscientious acts which are followed by no loss or injury. The relief sought by Lang in this case is tantamount to an advisory opinion, which courts cannot render.</td>
