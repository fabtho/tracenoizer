<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" Bahr, Assistant Attorney General, Attorney General's Office, 900 E. Because Lang seeks no money damages from Schafer, we conclude the trial court properly dismissed Lang's fraud action for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Lang alleged in his complaint Schafer and Banking Commissioner Gary Preszler were at a meeting where Lang "proffered evidence of the unusual, fraudulent procedures that the Bank of Steele had implemented in their creation of funds. " Lang further alleged, "after viewing the exhibits depicting fraud, both the Banking Commissioner and the Governor have remained completely mute. " Lang asserted Preszler was guilty of fraud because he has taken no action to address Lang's "exhibits depicting fraud.">

 At the time the maiden name of William's first wife was unknown. Subsequent research has identified her as Elizabeth5 Lawton, daughter of William4 Lawton of Rhode Island. Further evidence links the Southworth family to the Lawtons and the Hoars through the marriage of Sarah5 Southworth to William4 Lawton. Identifying William4 Hoar's wife has opened the door to colonial family connections of significant genealogical interest. William subsequently served in the Revolutionary War as an ensign in the local militia under Jonathan Childs, A.</td>
