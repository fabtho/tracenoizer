 The earliest publication concerning the family of Hezekiah1 Hoar, one of the original proprietors of Taunron, Plymouth Colony was published by Norton T. At the time the maiden name of William's first wife was unknown. Subsequent research has identified her as Elizabeth5 Lawton, daughter of William4 Lawton of Rhode Island. Further evidence links the Southworth family to the Lawtons and the Hoars through the marriage of Sarah5 Southworth to William4 Lawton. Identifying William4 Hoar's wife has opened the door to colonial family connections of significant genealogical interest.</td>
