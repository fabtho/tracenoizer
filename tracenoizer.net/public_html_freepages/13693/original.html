Any surety company which cancels the bond of a licensee shall notify the department, in writing, of such cancellation, giving the reason for that cancellation. If a claim is made to the department against the bond, which claim is based upon a final judgment of a court of record of this state, the dealer shall execute an additional bond for the amount necessary to maintain such security at the original level. However, an emergency vehicle dealer is not required to secure a separate license for each county if the licensee has otherwise complied with this chapter. No license for any additional county may be issued until the department is furnished with proof that the applicant has a principal place of business in such county and has otherwise complied with this chapter.">

 Hoard This is a portion of an article that was published in The New England Historical and Genealogical Register in April 1980. He was a resident of San Francisco, California at the time. The earliest publication concerning the family of Hezekiah1 Hoar, one of the original proprietors of Taunron, Plymouth Colony was published by Norton T. At the time the maiden name of William's first wife was unknown. Subsequent research has identified her as Elizabeth5 Lawton, daughter of William4 Lawton of Rhode Island.</td>
