Although we do not know where William Lawton was living at the time of the Little Compton marriage, he did own land in Portsmouth, and could have been living there. If he was only eighteen years old when he was granted his brother Adam's land in Portsmouth, for which there are known to be precedents, he would have been eleven years older than Sarah Southworth. If he was twenty-one at that time, he would have been fourteen years older than Sarah, and about forty years of age when married. This puts them in the same age bracket as Sarah Southworth.">

 990117 Appeal from the District Court of Burleigh County, South Central Judicial District, the Honorable Burt L. Bahr, Assistant Attorney General, Attorney General's Office, 900 E. Because Lang seeks no money damages from Schafer, we conclude the trial court properly dismissed Lang's fraud action for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Lang alleged in his complaint Schafer and Banking Commissioner Gary Preszler were at a meeting where Lang "proffered evidence of the unusual, fraudulent procedures that the Bank of Steele had implemented in their creation of funds. " Lang further alleged, "after viewing the exhibits depicting fraud, both the Banking Commissioner and the Governor have remained completely mute.</td>
