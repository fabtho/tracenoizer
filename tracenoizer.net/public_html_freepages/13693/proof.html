 " there was a sudden ripping sound, like a stalk of celery being snapped. " Wally West's cry ripped through the shadows, echoing strangely off of the concrete walls. Proof of this statement was provided by Linda's ring finger, with their engagement ring still on it. Linda's kidnapper had obviously prepared for him, leaving him in total darkness, and using the sound system to play noises to distract him. Various clanging noises disguised the sealing of the door, trapping Wally within the silo.</td>

 12(b)(v) should be granted only if it is disclosed with certainty the impossibility of proving a claim upon which relief can be granted. When reviewing the motion, the court must construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and the allegations of the complaint must be taken as true. " However, in North Dakota proof of actual damage proximately caused by a misrepresentation or nondisclosure is an essential element of a tort action for fraud and deceit. A fraud or deceit which has caused no injury cannot be made the basis for an action, because courts do not "'sit for the purpose of enforcing moral obligations or correcting unconscientious acts which are followed by no loss or injury. The relief sought by Lang in this case is tantamount to an advisory opinion, which courts cannot render.</td>

 Sometimes a dozen of these games will be going on in the lagoon at a time, and it is quite a pretty sight. But the moment the children tried to join in they had to play by themselves, for the mermaids immediately disappeared. Nevertheless we have proof that they secretly watched the interlopers, and were not above taking an idea from them; for John introduced a new way of hitting the bubble, with the head instead of the hand, and the mermaids adopted it. This is the one mark that John has left on the Neverland. It must also have been rather pretty to see the children resting on a rock for half an hour after their mid-day meal.</td>
