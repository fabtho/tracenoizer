 Petraskovic said that there is no such solution for building protection anywhere else in the world and that if it develops it can become a profitable export business. . The system is cheaper and renovation works are reduced from three months to three weeks, and objects can now resist stronger quakes than those which happened four years ago. One of the six renovated objects is the house of Ljig mayor Ljubomir Lazic. An experiment, simulating an earthquake, was carried out in the presence of the media and representatives of local authorities.</td>

 After some scrutiny of these, it was decided that none would be a good match for our operation. We knew what a LIMS could do, and these systems were lacking in certain areas. We created a manual system to be able to handle the functions that I used to handle through a LIMS. The bottles were placed on a special shelf in the sample refrigerator with the tests written on the labels. Analysts were required to search through the proper shelf to find the samples requiring the analysis they were performing.</td>
