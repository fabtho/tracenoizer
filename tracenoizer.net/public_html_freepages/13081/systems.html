 "This latest collaboration is yet another demonstration of the leading edge technology available from both companies in the DVD market. Based on Zoran's proprietary MPEG 2 video and Dolby Digital audio technology, the Vaddis decoder integrates the decoding and presentation functionality required for full implementation of the DVD standard in a single chip. The first member of the Vaddis family, the ZR36700 integrates many of the different components required in first generation DVD systems and interfaces efficiently to the remaining components in the system. Using a Zoran proprietary implementation, the Vaddis decoder requires only a single 16Mbit SDRAM for full operation. The Vaddis decoder dramatically reduces the number of chips and the size of the required memory thereby lowering the power consumption and overall cost of a DVD system.</td>

 The research themes at RSES address fundamental processes or global phenomena in the Earth Sciences with an emphasis on Earth materials and processes and the evolution of the Earth through time. RSES also has a responsibility for basic research in which applications or insights from the Australasian region are required or are opportune for the advancement of knowledge. The work of the school covers the broad areas of earth physics, solid earth geochemistry, earth materials, environmental processes and ore-systems studies with considerable interaction between these different areas. A summary of the School's research areas may be found in Current Areas of Research. More detailed descriptions of the work of particular research groups, student opportunities commercial activities and administrative information are available through the links on the sidebar.</td>
