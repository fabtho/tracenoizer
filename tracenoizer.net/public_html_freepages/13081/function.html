 By applying the system, as Sumarac said, the Ministry of Construction and Urban Planning will be in position to spend only 867 million dinars to renovate damaged objects, which is less in comparison with last year's one billion dinars which were used to renovate less number of objects. He also said that other municipalities will chose this system for renovation. "We want to use our scientific potential and to put it in function of the country's development," said Serbian Minister of Science, Technology and Development Dragan Domazet at the presentation of System DC 90 at the Maljen hotel, adding that the Ministry will provide funds for 80 percent of the expenses for university experts working on new technologies and the businessmen should cover another 20 percent. Petraskovic said that there is no such solution for building protection anywhere else in the world and that if it develops it can become a profitable export business. .</td>
