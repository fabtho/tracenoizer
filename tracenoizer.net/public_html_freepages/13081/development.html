 During my student days at Concordia I worked in microelectronics laboratory on many very interesting projects with very nice people. Since June 1999 I have been working for Trex Medical Inc. My work is in research and development of X-ray equipment for cardiovascular imaging. If you want to see something about what I am doing there click here.

 By applying the system, as Sumarac said, the Ministry of Construction and Urban Planning will be in position to spend only 867 million dinars to renovate damaged objects, which is less in comparison with last year's one billion dinars which were used to renovate less number of objects. He also said that other municipalities will chose this system for renovation. "We want to use our scientific potential and to put it in function of the country's development," said Serbian Minister of Science, Technology and Development Dragan Domazet at the presentation of System DC 90 at the Maljen hotel, adding that the Ministry will provide funds for 80 percent of the expenses for university experts working on new technologies and the businessmen should cover another 20 percent. Petraskovic said that there is no such solution for building protection anywhere else in the world and that if it develops it can become a profitable export business. .</td>

 Application of theoretical understanding to these biological systems is accomplished through the use of advanced computing. Many of the theoretical studies are possible only through use of the supercomputing facilities at the Advanced Biomedical Computing Center, FCRDC, which was created and sponsored through the initiative of the Laboratory of Experimental and Computational Biology. The Laboratory oversees the development and operation of the contractor-operated The ABCC which serves as the only public-domain supercomputing center dedicated to biomedical research in the world. Access is provided to suitable applicants from the biomedical community, on the basic of scientific priority as evaluated by a time allocation group made up of representatives from the NCI, other NIH Institutes, and the extramural community. The computing environment is centered around Cray vector supercomputers and scalar parallel machines.</td>
