 I am currently interested in compiler optimizations for Javaprogramming language. I worked the summers of 1996 and 1997 as an intern in Sun Microsystems on implementing some of the optimizations in their Java compiler. thesis is "Compiling Java for High Performance and the Internet". I am a committee member for the The Second International Conference on The Practical Application of Java. We have developed an object-oriented version of the popular Linpack library, called OwlPack (Objects Within the Linear algebra PACKage).</td>

 Two versions of the fifth generation COACH are being offered to digital camera makers. The COACH Ve based entry-level solution is designed for powering 1. The COACH Vp based performance-level solution is built to power the higher resolution 2. COACH V-based cameras capture high-quality still images and can also capture movie clips including audio at over 25 frames per second. Clip size is limited only by the storage media size.</td>
