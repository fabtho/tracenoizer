 If you haven't been to a Swingin' Dick show, you've been missing out on the wildest comedy night in town. Crude, lewd, socially unacceptable, but always funny. You'll see things you may not want to see and hear things that'll make you want to get up and go to church in the morning. ComedySportz offers an alternative to obscene, offensive comedy as two teams of performers challenge each other in improvisational games. They've been doing their schtick for 13 years now, so you can count on top-notch, professional entertainment.</td>
