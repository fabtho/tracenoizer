<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" This inimitable sound is markedly enhanced by the firm-footing in serious songwriting and vocal arrangements. Kid Dakota Darren Jackson and Christopher McGuire are the duo that comprise Kid Dakota. McGuire (former drummer of 12 Rods) sets the beat while Jackson fills in with vocals and guitar (both play ice cube trays). Although his underground success is self-initiated, Jackson gives credit elsewhere. But we live in the middle of nowhere and it's important to get out of town and play elsewhere.">

 We will be touring in May, and then again in the fall around November check Facedown Records for more info. I noticed Point of Recognition has just been added to Cornerstone, are you guys excited about that. Yeah we are excited to play again this year, hopefully we can whip up something cool. Who is one of your favorite bands to tour with, or to play with. Have you had any interesting things happen to you while being on tour.</td>

 . Griz O-line crucial to success - Local Sports - GreatFallsTribune. But when the rivals hook up Saturday in Bozeman for the 101st Cat-Griz clash, the guys in the Grizzly trenches may be as crucial to the outcome as the quarterbacks who play behind them. For the first Cat-Griz game in recent memory, Montana may rely more on the run than the pass as the Grizzlies try to extend their winning streak to 16 straight years. There are several reasons for the change in philosophy.</td>

 However, Dawe made very different life choice and left for Florida, in 1924, to sell real estate with only marginal success. He then moved north, to Atlanta and then Birmingham, Alabama where he began working as a copywriter in the advertising department of a women's ready-to-wear store. While there, the director of a local stock company ( The Jefferson Players of the Birmingham Little Theater) approached him to perform in a play titled Iz Zat So. Dawe was intrigued and took the part receiving good reviews when the play opened. For a while, he worked days, and acted at night until he returned to the store after a matinee and found a foreclosure sign on the door.</td>
