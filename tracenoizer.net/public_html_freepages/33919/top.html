 In this case the mapping of the gas velocity field and surface brightness, with the aid of 5 parallel slit position and narrow-band H-alpha imaging respectively, enabled a superior detailed modeling. This provided a very precise measurement for the BH mass, of 2. Superimposed to the R-band image (top right), shown are the 5 slit position adopted to extract the ionized gas velocity field. The spatial axis is vertical with the same orientation as in Figure 3 and the wavelenght increase to the right. Based on the analysis of the ionized gas kinematics, our BH mass measurements are not only consistent with the most accurate BH masses so far obtained studying other kind of tracers for the potential, but also extend considerably the range of Hubble types where such comparison is possible.</td>

 There were some problems in the choice of boundary conditions that was making the code blow up. Due to the iterative process of the code's structure we were arriving and oscillating solutions that obviously do not happen in real life. These code complications were solved giving more forgiving boundary conditions, such as slip walls and a mixed boundary condition on the top surface. Gary should have been working on the MATLAB, not so much progress as of now, but diligently learning the different MATLAB toolboxes. These disagreements were solved with the mediation of Dr.</td>
