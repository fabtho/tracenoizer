 36' is a coldplay track having a lot of fun in the studio, the pace is fast and furious and the guitars rip, featuring one tim wheeler from ash (and simon pegg from top comedy show 'spaced') this track shows that coldplay could go anywhere from here . this ep comprises of 4 tracks of gorgeous electronically based instrumentals. the opening track 'oben beg' is the highlight - opening with a crowd noise sample from some far off land it quickly starts with a simple 2 note keyboard motif. you genuinely have no idea where the track is going to go. probaly due to the fact that each track is supposedly made of different recordings which have been put together .</td>

 Also a bibliography was put together for future reference. On Wednesday Bill Gary and Susan met to go over a test scenario of the MGFLO code (I was sick and was not able to attend). The code running was successful and TechPlot was used to quickly view the validity of the results. In the future the code will be run in parallel mode and interesting results (evaluated through TechPlot) will be 3-D rendered on Ensight for greater manageability of the results. During this meeting we all discussed what the project direction was going to be, and also what was expected from us.</td>
