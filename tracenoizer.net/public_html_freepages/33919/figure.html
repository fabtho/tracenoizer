 The data from SUNNS and from related projects provide an excellent way to test this claims and explore the nuclei of disk galaxies. STIS kinematics, derived from ionized gas provide not only a ten-fold increase in spatial resolution, but also eliminate many systematic uncertainties arising from the poorly understood orbital anisotropy of the stars. Figure 1 shows the 4 galaxies among the 24 of the SUNNS survey for which the kinematical modeling of the ionized gas was feasible, measuring the BH mass for 3 galaxies (in the case of NGC 2787, NGC 4459, and NGC 4596) and placing an upper limits on the BH mass of NGC 4203 (Sarzi et al. (1998) BH mass measurements were somehow over estimated. The lenght of the slit aperture indicate the extent of the ionized gas rotation curves.</td>

 is used if the value on the left returns undefined or false. Is this the way you avoid the delayed getBytesLoaded() problem. I cannot seem to figure out ,which frames should be keyframes (is 2 a keyframe). On which frame the movieclipholder should be placed. It's not working over here even if I give the myTarget mc the correct name and load the xternal one into that.</td>
