 the creator of this lovely ep apparently is french (arr - of course . all becomes clear now, the land of quality accessible electronic music - air,barth,alex gopher) and is rasing money for less priviledged areas of the world. if there was any justice in the world this would be picked up on any openminded dance mix cd and raise monster amounts of cash for him to make more of these groovepop experiences and spread his love to every corner of the globe to the benefit of all concerned. obvious homage towards the best drugs friend from the early 90's. the three tracks have a more melodic quality than their previous release but has the same instant nerve shredding melodies.</td>
