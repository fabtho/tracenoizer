 In 1954 the chapter was able to buy the former Alpha Gamma Delta Sorority house, which was in good condition and suited to the chapter's needs. After a reorganization in the early nineties, the fraternity quickly regained prominence on the University of Washington campus and within a couple years performed an extensive remodel project on the entire chapter house. Unfortunately, major risk management violations were discovered during a chapter social event in 1998 which resulted in a University imposed 4 year banishment from the campus. Faced with the possibility of three years without incoming funds, it was decided to sell the chapter house to Pi Kappa Alpha in order to retire the outstanding debts from the remodel project. We have also located the House Corporations who has been maintaining the funds from the sale of the property to Pi Kappa Alpha.</td>

 . Compact, young star clusters are very common in a wide range of starburst environments. The formation of bound clusters appears to be a major, if not ubiquitous, mode of star formation in starbursts systems. Star-forming circumnuclear rings often contain rich populations of clusters. The clusters are young (ages ranging from a few to a few hundred Myr), compact (half-light radii few parsecs), and have a wide range of luminosities.</td>
