 Therefore, the intelligent systems of tomorrow will be hybrids of the intelligence in machines, biology, and human cognition. . Scientists, engineers, and scholars throughout the world have therefore been developing intelligent systems that are considerably more powerful. They have recognized that some of the most intelligent systems already exist in biology and the human mind. Therefore, the intelligent systems of tomorrow will be hybrids of the intelligence in machines, biology, and human cognition.</td>
