 In 1951 Agee also published The Morning Watch about a young student who is so consumed by an internal spiritual conflict that his classmates ostracize him because of his strange behavior. The boy is only able to form friendships with his classmates after he kills a snake in front of his fellow students. However the snake's death causes the boy to question his internal goodness and creates emotional strife. It was also during this period of time that Agee, after years of drinking and smoking, began to show signs heart disease, as he experienced several minor heart attacks. In 1953 Agee also wrote the screenplay and acted in a film short based upon Stephen Crane's The Bride Comes to Yellow Sky.</td>
