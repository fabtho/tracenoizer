 Now then, I don't know how many of you read westerns, but the information contained in a recent long letter from Laurence James should get you thumbing through them the next time you're in WHS. l00 with a bit of 'July, You're a Woman' and on the next page references to 'Stone County Road,' 'Never Goin' Back' and 'Shackles and Chains. A later book in this is dedicated to John Harvey - the Lonesome Picker, and the sixth book in the series is dedicated to me. Harvey's series under the name Jonothan White has a deal of Stewart material in it. I wrote a science fiction series under my name and mentioned John Stewart as among my favourite singers in the author's biog at the beginning of the books.</td>
