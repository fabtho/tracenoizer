 Laurence James's first editing job at New English Library, Satan's Slaves (originally published under the pseaudonym of James Taylor but actually written by James Moffat, aka Richard Allen) is now available from Codex in a new edition. . Mick Norman biography Mick Norman 'Mick Norman' was the pseudonym used by Laurence James for his massively influential Hell's Angels books. As co-editor of New English Library with Mark Howell, he changed the reading habits of a generation with a list that ran from the wildly reactionary (Richard Allen and Mary Whitehouse) to the wild. New English Library adopted a production line approach to literature -- identify a niche, then commission a hack writer with a fake name.</td>
