 The concept of a school devoted to commerce and industry was proposed by J. Although never formally appointed to the role, Laughlin can be considered the first dean of the GSB. Laughlin's design of the school's first curriculum drew from a number of courses at the University, stressing practical affairs. Students elected to attend the college, took courses from its prescribed groupings, and earned B. This was a matter of concern to both Laughlin and William Rainy Harper, first president of the University, and in 1902 the College was reorganized; it was given a recognizably separate faculty, and acquired (formally) its own Dean.</td>

JAVA - Conclusion Concluding Comments In the period 1951-1985, I served as head of the Department of Physics (which became the Department of Physics and Astronomy in 1969) of the University of Iowa. Perhaps my favorite was General Astronomy, an introductory but rigorous course on the solar system, with laboratory, which I taught for 17 years. My closest working relationships with students involved ones at the graduate level.</td>
