 Partners is the quarterly newsletter (published in February, May, August, and November) of the Research and Education Foundation of the College of Family Physicians of Canada. . Not only do they provide valuable services and products essential to running our national organization, they also support the charitable mission of the REF to improve the quality of family medical care in Canada. We want to acknowledge the generous support of the following companies and their staff for sponsoring the design and creation of the REF Donor Appreciation Wall. Their support allows more of the REF's charitable donations to go directly toward research and educational programs for CFPC members.</td>
