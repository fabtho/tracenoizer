 His work still continues to move and delight, as it has done for over thirty five years and will continue to do so until man finally turns music off for good. . The Bob Dylan Biography Site - A complete biography of the founder of rock, Bob Dylan. Bob Dylan is one of my favourite artists, and I also have an interest in the internet so I decided to make a web site devoted to him.

Getting a little closer, I couldn't make out any evidence of rock 'n' roll road debauchery, just the unmistakable image of Lisa Simpson flickering on a TV set. And is it enough for Bob Dylan to be a living, breathing icon (and creator of Wallflower Jakob) that he no longer needs to make an effort to connect with his brethren while performing on stage. It just wasn't enough for him to dress like a riverboat gambler and solo until his fingers bled.</td>

 A series of dreams about America as it once and never was. It was folk music, deep within its core, from the mountains and the delta and the blacktop of Highway 61.
