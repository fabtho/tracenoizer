 In April, he opened for John Lee Hooker at Gerde's Folk City. Five months later, Dylan performed another concert at the venue, which was reviewed positively by Robert Shelton in the New York Times. Hammond produced Dylan's eponymous debut album (released in March 1962), a collection of folk and blues standards that boasted only two original songs. Over the course of 1962, Dylan began to write a large batch of original songs, many of which were political protest songs in the vein of his Greenwich contemporaries. These songs were showcased on his second album, The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan.</td>

 Throughout it all, Dylan has produced several albums that are universally recognized as the best in their genres. For a fan in the beginning stages of amassing a Dylan collection, here are the five essential Bob Dylan albums one needs to start. Much more polished and listenable than his self-titled first album, Freewheelin' is a coffeehouse concert in a box. The immediacy and unpolished singing style that defined the early Dylan sound can be found in every track of Freewheelin'. Blending covers of folk chestnuts with stunning originals, Dylan shows the first signs of an artist coming into his own on this evocative album.</td>
