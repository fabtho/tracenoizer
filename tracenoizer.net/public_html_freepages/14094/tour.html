 After a rebellious youth, he moved to New York City in 1960. As a lyricist he captured the cynicism, anger, and alienation of American youth, which reverberated in his harsh vocal delivery and insistent guitar-harmonica accompaniment. Enigmatic and reclusive, he has become a cult figure who satisfies his followers with an occasional album or, as in 1975, a concert tour. See biographies by Robert Shelton (1986) and Bob Spitz (1988); studies by Paul Cable (1980), Betsy Bowden (1982), and Tim Riley (1992). .</td>
