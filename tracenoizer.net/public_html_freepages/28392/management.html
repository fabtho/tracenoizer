 All Editions See more product details Great Buy Buy this book with Business Research Methods today. Editorial Reviews Book Info Discusses the challenge of how to focus on highquality products while achieving bottom-line performance that shareholders and the investment community demand. Introduces a new management science called Financially Focused Quality (FFQ). The author spends a lot of time on how to handle administrative issues such as how to organize a finance department (I am not sure what this has to do with quality) and handling administrative details such as how to administratively handle suggestions and improvement ideas. What is not handled is how to actually do any of the Total Quality Management (TQM) or quality initiatives that are mentioned but not discussed.</td>
