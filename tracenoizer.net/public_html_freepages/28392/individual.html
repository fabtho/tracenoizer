 Two-way programs share many features but vary in significant ways as well, and these areas of variability in implementation will be a focus of this report. There are also a number of unanswered questions about how to handle certain issues; concerns that were voiced by schools during the course of the study will be raised in the next section. Finally, following some concluding remarks, an appendix will list other sources of information about two-way bilingual education, from research reports to videotapes produced by individual schools. Oyster Bilingual Elementary School has a two-way program with a long history. Begun in 1971, the Oyster School program enrolls students from pre-K through 6th grade.</td>

 Since October the director has devoted substantial time to meeting with at least 35 individuals and groups. The provost's charge has proved to be a most valuable way to identify and begin to meet institutional research needs. The meetings have led to strong collegial support for the office and enabled the director to conduct an informal internal scan of the university, thus systematically discovering sources for historical and current information, investigating data and research needs, and getting a clear view of effectiveness processes in individual divisions and at the central level. Since October the director has expanded her professional contacts to include individuals at the Carnegie Foundation (currently the foundation is reclassifying higher education institutions, which they do once each eight to ten years); U. Therefore internal resources are critical to effective reporting.</td>
