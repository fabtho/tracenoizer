Editorial Reviews Book Info Discusses the challenge of how to focus on highquality products while achieving bottom-line performance that shareholders and the investment community demand. Introduces a new management science called Financially Focused Quality (FFQ).

 Articulation beyond elementary school has become a major concern for many districts, and few have so far instituted a full K-12 sequence. Program Design Although most programs share similar goals, design choices vary considerably. In some cases, the choices represent concessions to local conditions, such as demographics or community attitudes (e. , a neighborhood school with relatively few native English speakers may choose to go forward with a two-way program without a balance of language backgrounds represented in each class). At this point, we do not have good evidence linking such differences in programs to differences in outcomes.</td>
