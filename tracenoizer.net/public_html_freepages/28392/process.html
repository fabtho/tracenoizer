 But a text claiming to discuss how to tie quality and finance together should at least discuss how to use both the finance and quality improvement tools rather than focus on how to set up administrative functions to manage the paperwork. This exceptional text should be on the book shelf of every manager and student of quality. It takes a comprehensive look at contemporary process improvement methodologies, and provides a well-founded education on relevant financial issues. This book is also very interesting to read, filled with fascinating case studies that relate to real-life situations that the author, Mr. I found the breadth of topics covered to be exceptional.</td>

 Using the faculty information sections of the 1991-1992 annual reports, the database will be extended and used throughout the coming academic year on almost a daily basis. In addition each school will receive a paper and computer file copy of two years of faculty information in the fall. We are in the process of adding Social Security numbers to allow comparison of our micro-based data with data in the Human Resources System, eliminate the possibility of confusing individuals with the same name, and increase security. When the addition is complete, selected printed lists will show only Social Security numbers, not names. The associate director of human resources has assumed responsibility for auditing and correcting faculty information in the human resource system, and we anticipate assisting him by making available the information we have collected.</td>

 The text is designed for students with little or no background in the movement sciences--the book covers all of the material required to meet minimum competencies established by AAHPERD's Motor Development Academy. Life Span Motor Development (Second Edition) will lead your students through the principles, research, and applied practice of motor development from infancy through older adulthood. They'll learn about new concepts in motor development, like the dynamic systems perspective--a new theoretical approach that is reshaping the way many view the developmental process. Redesigned in an easy-to-follow format, the book is now divided into three parts. Part I provides an overview of motor development--including factors affecting prenatal and postnatal development--followed by a discussion of physical growth processes occurring in various body systems.</td>
