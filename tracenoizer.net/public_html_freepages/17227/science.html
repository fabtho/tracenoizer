<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" Commentary on Lacouture's review in the press, which has been extensive, gives a fourth-hand account. That is what is available to readers of the American press. As an instance, consider the Christian Science Monitor editorial already cited, which gives a fair sample of what is available to the American public. Lacouture, like Ponchaud, emphasizes the brutality of the American war, which laid the basis for all that followed. These references disappear from the Monitor editorial, which pretends that the current suffering in Cambodia takes place in an historical vacuum, as a mere result of Communist savagery.">

 Current Volume (Volume 43) Volume 43, Number 1, January 2002 (pp. . Material Transactions Online Materials Transactions, Online The Japan Institute of Metals (JIM) supports the worldwide dissemination from Japan of research results from basic sciences to applied technology in the field of materials science and engineering. Since January 2001, JIM has therefore issued its journal, formerly called Materials Transactions JIM, as an electronic journal to broaden the international distribution and ensure the prompt delivery of scientific and technical information. The journal, now simply entitled Materials Transactions from January 2001, is appropriately designated as an international journal published collaboratively with other institutes involved in materials science and engineering.</td>

 Jim Breen's Home Page JIM BREEN'S HOME PAGE In case you haven't met me. From December 2000 to June 2001 I was a Visiting Professor at the Institute for the Study of the Languages and Cultures of Asia and Africa (ILCAA) in the Tokyo University of Foreign Studies in Japan. I teach subjects in the Computer Science and Digital Systems undergraduate courses, but mainly I work in the Master of Digital Communications. I have some on-line information about the subjects I teach. In 1993 and 1999 I spent some time at the INT in France as a visiting researcher.</td>
