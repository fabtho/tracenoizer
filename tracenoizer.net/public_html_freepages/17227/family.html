<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" " In 1978, while "Saturday Night Live" was sending John Belushi's career into hyperspace, his little brother was making a name for himself back in Chicago, not only for his work with Second City but for his performance in a new David Mamet play called Sexual Perversity in Chicago. Soon there would be stints in Los Angeles--for a couple of short-lived sitcoms , a small role in the James Caan film Thief in 1980 and then, a breakthrough part in the national touring company of The Piratesof Penzance. The Belushi family's oldest boys, misfits in their hometown, seemed to have conquered the world. John was already a movie star, Jim looked to be well on the way. And then, on March 5, 1982, it all came crashing down.">

 After a distinctly ordinary degree in mathematics, I joined the old Postmaster General's Department as a trainee programmer in 1968. Along the way I collected an MBA, which convinced me I didn't want to be manager, so in 1983 I joined a consultancy as a communications consultant. Lots of travelling, stress and missing my family led me to move to academia, and in 1985 I took a position of Principal Lecturer at the old Chisholm Institute of Technology. In 1990, as part of the "unification" of the tertiary education system in Australia, Chisholm merged with Monash University. My position was converted to the university equivalent (Associate Professor), and I took up a fixed-term appointment as (full) Professor while I was heading a department.</td>
