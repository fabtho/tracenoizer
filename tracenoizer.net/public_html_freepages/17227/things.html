 Please feel free to send me email about the various Japanese projects described on this page. I will try very hard to reply quickly, but I get a lot of mail, and long letters may take a while. If you are thinking of emailing me about other things, especially to ask me questions not related to my projects, please read this page first, as it may save us both some time. (Please note that I do not buy or sell ukiyo-e or any other Japanese art, nor do I appraise Japanese prints. Emailed requests about any of the above will usually be ignored.</td>

 Belushi's voice goes quiet as if he's suddenly remembered something. "But you know," he says, "I've scraped with the devil, too. Little things mostly--shoplifting, fistfights and, once, a stolen car. "In Wheaton, Illinois," Belushi says, "I was the crime rate. " Growing up in the white-bread, far-west suburbs of Chicago, the middle son of an Albanian immigrant, Jim Belushi had trouble finding his place in the world.</td>
