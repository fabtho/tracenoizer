 I teach subjects in the Computer Science and Digital Systems undergraduate courses, but mainly I work in the Master of Digital Communications. I have some on-line information about the subjects I teach. In 1993 and 1999 I spent some time at the INT in France as a visiting researcher. I sort-of maintain a page of links on telecomms matter. I was quoted in an article in the Melbourne Age recently.</td>

 In his corrections, Lacouture raises the questions whether precision on these matters is very important. Or perhaps, we may add, whether the victims of My Lai numbered in the hundreds or tens of thousands, if a factor of 100 is unimportant. But if postwar Cambodia is more similar to France after liberation, where many thousands of people were massacred within a few months under far less rigorous conditions than those left by the American war, then perhaps a rather different judgement is in order. That the latter conclusion may be more nearly correct is suggested by the analyses mentioned earlier. We disagree with Lacouture's judgement on the importance of precision on this question.</td>
