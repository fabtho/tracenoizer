 From 1995 to 1997 I studied in the Department of Theology of the University of Durham. In Durham I served as a student member of the University Senate Committee for Ceremonial and Honorary Degrees, and convened a working party on the Constitution and Standing Orders of the Durham Students' Union, for which I was honoured with Honorary Life Membership of the Union. During my course I submitted a dissertation on the influence of the Books of Discipline on the ministry of oversight in the Church of Scotland between 1560 and 1618. I was awarded a Lightfoot Scholarship in 1996, obtained First Class Honours in Theology and was admitted to the Degree of Bachelor of Arts on 3rd July 1997. From 1993 to 1995 I followed a part-time course in church law at the Cardiff Law School of the University of Wales.</td>

 Donald Maiden saw the Bible in Kristopher Pearce, a Haines City pilot who died at the controls Saturday while ferrying a Sunday School family. A servant of Christianity and the NorthRidge Christian Academy, Pearce of Haines City brought to mind Barnabas, a companion of the the Apostle Paul, Maiden said. It was difficult to determine whether Maiden was speaking of the gentile who accompanied Paul on missionary tours, or Pearce, 36, who often flew church relief missions and church outreach workers for service in the Bahamas. Pearce was full of the spirit of Christ and performing God's will when he died. Henry and Becky Anhalt of Davenport were returning with Pearce and their three children from a vacation bible school in Eleuthera when Pearce died at the controls of heart problems.</td>
