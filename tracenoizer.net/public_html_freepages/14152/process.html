 After a year of writing songs at home, Ted joined the praise team of his congregation in Dallas where he remained for 5 years. The group, Y'hudah, released an album of 12 original messianic jewish songs and opened concerts for Lamb, performing at national conferances and was asked to play for the wedding of Melody Green (widow of Keith Green) as well doing missions in Eastern Europe and street evangelism. After this 4 song Sampler was finished he began the process of forming a band. However, this band was nothing like the songs he had began recording with the solo project so they went into the studio and recorded their own 11 song CD which was released in August of 1998. Radio all over the USA has been spinning the disk and Big Methuselah is showing up on many charts with several of their songs.</td>

 He so charms the gods of the Underworld that they let a mortal in. So we had to find a way to endow this character with an Orphean gift, and we came up with a device. So a huge part of the process of writing the film was finding the appropriate song for every moment. One reason the screenplay took so long to write was our long search for the right musical expression in our various dramatic moments. We would rewrite a scene to work with the song and sometimes change a song to work with the scene.</td>
