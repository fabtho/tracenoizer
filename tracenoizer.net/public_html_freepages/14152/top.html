 One CD is called "big methuselah" because he was once told by a christian record label that he's too old to be in the music biz. Big Methuselah has shown up on radio charts all over the USA and abroad. They were also chosen as one of the Top 20 Christian Rock Indies in America by 7Ball Magazine. He narrowly escaped two bombings and a robbery to get them out and it was worth it. Fans of house will love Yod, while fans of jazz and world music will love "Letter to the Hebrews".</td>
