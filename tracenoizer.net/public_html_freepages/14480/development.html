 It is only when it gave up on changing the world that it has achieved its greatest success, becoming almost de rigeur in the contemporary art scene. " Is it possible that a net art or a net activist art could question rather than reinforce the sorts of distinctions implied by these views; the idea that the "internal" characteristics of a medium can be simply prised apart from their cultural organization and used as the value-neutral building blocks of a new formalist art practice. An interesting point of reference here is Paul Edwards book The Closed World, on the politics of digital and analog systems in the early development of programming languages as part of military research. This model also preserves a fairly conventional idea of the relationship between the artist and the viewer (various forms of revelation, shock or correction overseen by the artist who is first able to recognize, manipulate, and call attention to the slippery signifiers of a new medium). I think that in some ways net based culture holds out an even more challenging possibility; to force us to rethink the conventional identity of the artist as someone who develops projects or works that are then administered to a receptive viewer.</td>
