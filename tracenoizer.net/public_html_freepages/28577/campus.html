 . The Careers Service provides a link between graduating students and potential employers. Each year a campus recruitment campaign is arranged for employers who come onto the campus to conduct information sessions, and in many cases, to interview applicants for positions with their organisations. Sessions are generally held between 12-2pm and details are advertised on notice boards around campus and also in the Careers Service area. Students should register their interest in attending an employer session at the Careers Service.</td>

 . To this day, most institutions of higher education have intercollegiate athletic programs which means that a large number of student-athletes exist on American campuses. Student-athletes, like other special populations on campus, have unique needs that make them different from other students. One area that student-athletes need help in is in accessing and learning how to use the library system on their campus. Issues such as heavy practice and travel schedules make it difficult for student-athletes to make effective use of library resources.</td>

 Higher Probability of Graduating More Enthusiasm toward USF Making the transition from high school to a major university is challenging, sometimes frightening and certainly exciting--all at the same time. The University Experience at USF is a "Student Success Course" designed specifically for first-year students to integrate them into the University. The experience is both social and intellectual carrying a letter grade with 2 credit hours including campus field trips, guest speakers, weekly class meetings, and "networking at USF. " We are proud of our University Experience program and hope it will become a valuable beginning to your college experience at the University of South Florida. .</td>
