 The opportunities are arranged alphabetically by science fields. The production of this guide was commissioned by the Yale College Dean's Office and funded by The New England Consortium for Undergraduate Science Education (NECUSE). The Guide was prepared primarily for use by students at the NECUSE schools. A non-comprehensive listing of more recent undergraduate research opportunities may be found on the YSER (Yale Science and Engineering Research) site at at www. HOW TO USE THIS GUIDE Research opportunities are listed in the science sections.</td>

Development Fund for Black Students in Science and Technology The Development Fund For Black Students In Science And Technology A Nonprofit 501(c)(3) Tax-Exempt Organization The Development Fund for Black Students in Science and Technology (DFBSST) is an endowment fund which provides scholarships to African-American undergraduate students enrolled in scientific or technical fields of study at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). History The Fund was established by a group of concerned black technical professionals who realized that it is essential to provide financial assistance to talented black students who choose to pursue scientific or technical careers. Additionally, these students are supported at historically black institutions of higher learning, where it has been demonstrated that they will experience the highest rates of retention and graduation.</td>

 . A well-supported reform movement to introduce new methods for quantitative training of undergraduates, particularly in the calculus, has recently begun to produce many new educational models. I have carried out a variety of activities as part of an NSF-supported project to produce a flexible curriculum of quantitative courses for undergraduate life science students, able to be integrated with the biological courses these students take and utilizing examples from recent biological research. Two Workshops have been organized, the first of which provided guidelines for key concepts and content for entry-level and upper-division quantitative courses, and the second one focusing on methods to incorporate more quantitative concepts directly within life science courses. .</td>
