 The best process is to do another campaign with petition and another march just to show how presistent we are. By setting up office space down in the main floor of Wyckham or making big signs. The SA has to go outside of Wyckham House to make sure students are aware of what's going on. It needs to be a strong voice in order to achieve that goal. I believe that students have different lives and stories.</td>

 This is where we can keep donors and friends of the University informed. . This fall a highly enthusiastic group of Sac State students began calling alumni to talk about enhancing the value of a Sac State degree now and for the future by giving back to the University. There is a vested connection on both ends of the phone as these new fundraisers find out what alumni want and are interested in supporting at their University. Ask them to sing the fight song over the phone and they will.</td>
