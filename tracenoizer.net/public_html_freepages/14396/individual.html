 . WWW-SOI Team Science Page SOI Team Science Investigations The core scientific program of SOI is to be achieved through a set of well-defined team science objectives. The activities of the science teams are summarized here and described in more detail under the individual home pages. The SOI science teams individually define the scientific activities, both observation and analysis, needed to achieve their objectives. Each team has a Team Leader who is responsible for organizing the team and its activities.</td>

 Charter Schools Freedom from many of the regulations that govern public schools allows charter schools to be organized around particular visions of education. Proponents believe that charter schools can provide students with the opportunity to choose an education environment that fits their interests and needs. The site offers information about charter school legislation in each state, contact information, and profiles of individual charter schools. Find out what effects charter schools have on student achievement and on other public schools. Learn how to start a charter school and obtain funds.</td>

 I am examining how cricket calling behavior differs in populations that vary in parasitoid abundance, and what happens to cricket reproductive biology during parasitoid development. , high levels of resistance are associated with decreases in other fitness related traits), an intermediate level of susceptibility might be favored by selection. Specifically, I am measuring aerobic performance (VO2max), sprint performance (during the escape response), and endurance on individual guppies descended from different wild-caught populations. In addition to the performance measures, morphological and enzymatic measurements are also being conducted on the guppies, which will enable me to look for mechanistic correlations between an individual's performance and its organ and muscle morphology. Is Mayr's allopatric speciation the major mode of speciation.</td>
