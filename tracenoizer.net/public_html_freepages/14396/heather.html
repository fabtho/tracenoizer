 While weaving literature and music into the presentation, the emphasis is on art quilts through which the maker interprets her part of the globe. Several artists' bodies of work will be shown (3 to 5 pieces by each artist) along with representative scenes from nature. Praise for Heather as a Lecturer Thank you again for sharing your talents with our passengers. Lee Drury, Cruise Director, World Explorer Cruises As an art instructor who teaches beginning level design, I recently arranged a tour of a local quilt exhibition for my students. Heather's discussion of how traditional and non-traditional techniques, patterns and images have broadened the definition of contemporary quilt making opened the student's eyes to the complexity and skill in this art form.</td>

 It makes more work for me, but it's the standard I want them to have for themselves, and for the patients they serve. I have a full-time clinical position with a huge case load and had to manufacture time to meet with students. Heather unselfishly picked up the slack to allow me more time with the students. Without a highly capable and committed person like Heather, my achievement wouldn't have been possible. That distinction came earlier last year when clinical pharmacist Karin Durant joined the antimicrobial restriction program he and VandenBussche established at U-M Hospital in September 1997.</td>
