 . Nelson of JPL, and the NASA Program Scientist for Deep Space 1, Dr. Fifteen scientists have been chosen to lead the analysis of measurements to be made by miniaturized instruments on board Deep Space 1. Prepare raw and reduced data for archiving for future use by the scientific community. Analyze, interpret, and publish first results and findings in peer-review literature.</td>

 The new site and modifications will continue to be responsive to practitioners and researchers. Featuring some comprehensive sites, and fewer individual links. Research Practice Data collection, survey analysis, report prep, plus a few realities like FEDEX and Purdue's Reference Desk. The Establishment Associations and societies, for survey research and related disciplines. The Survey Research Center is a resource made possible by a grant from The Andrew W.</td>

 Students are expected to build on this in second semester. f's Statistical inference, including common sampling distributions and simple proofs. Illustrations include - Interval estimation and hypothesis testing - examples for one, two, many-samples, including simple regression analysis. In addition, students are expected to acquire reasonable familiarity with a basic statistical package through independent work, exercises and assignments. In this module, various advanced techniques of operations research are described and used to solve practical problems.</td>
