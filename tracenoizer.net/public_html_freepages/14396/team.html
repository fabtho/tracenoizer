MFI Team Science MFI Team Science Introduction The MFI team's science endeavors are shared between those areas in which our members take the lead, which are listed below, and those in which we collaborate with science teams all around the world. The collaborations are many, mainly because of the obvious importance of the WIND magnetic field data in many supporting roles. The MFI bibliography (listed at the bottom) is split almost evenly according to those two areas, the team's lead science and support science.">

 Please see the Original SOI Science Objectives for a terse summary of the topics involved. . WWW-SOI Team Science Page SOI Team Science Investigations The core scientific program of SOI is to be achieved through a set of well-defined team science objectives. The activities of the science teams are summarized here and described in more detail under the individual home pages. The SOI science teams individually define the scientific activities, both observation and analysis, needed to achieve their objectives.</td>

 During college, recommendations from her science and math teachers helped Heather land a three-year internship as a tech aide for 3M's Superabrasives and Microfinishing Department. Faculty recommendations also helped her win a prestigious Goldwater national science scholarship. Heather says her lab skills, her ability to think critically about a problem and her knack for communicating ideas to a team -- skills she learned at St. Catherine's students interning as tech aides right now. 3M supervisors ask me all the time to call my old prof for intern recommendations.</td>
