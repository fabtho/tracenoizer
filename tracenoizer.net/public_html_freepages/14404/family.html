 I have numerous baptism, marriage and burial entries from the Ecclesiastic returns some of which are not connected to any of my family. . How It All Began I grew up hearing stories about how my maternal grandmothers family were in India for 200 years, how they worked for the Honourable East India Company, how my Great Great Grandmother was the illegitimate daughter of Richard Brinsley Sheridan, my Great Great Grandfather was Band Master for some Maharajah and my Great Great Great Grandfather was a Master Mariner. In 1945 my Grandmother left India with my Grandfather, my mother and Uncle. Her family all left India and moved to Australia, Canada and Rhodesia.</td>
