 There has been a growing interest among those of Irish ancestry in tracing their Irish roots in recent years. With the advent of computers, genealogy in Ireland has come of age. It is now possible to have research carried out on one's family history from the millions of genealogical records computerised at the Irish Family History Foundation's network of research centres in Ireland. The Irish Family History Foundation is the co-ordinating body for a network of government approved genealogical research centres in the Republic of Ireland (Eire) and in Northern Ireland which have computerised tens of millions of Irish ancestral records of different types. Many of the church records computerised at Irish Family History Foundation Centres are not available in public repositories or through other genealogy outlets.</td>

 If you are looking for film footage, I recommend the National Film Preservation Foundation's guide to film libraries. . Because the focus of research has traditionally centered around film itself, this guide focuses on repositories that hold major collections of organizational or personal records documenting the film industry (as opposed to repositories holding the medium of film).
