 Monthly meetings are held by each branch at which talks of genealogical or local interest are given. Some meetings are devoted to discussions about family history problems and much helpful advice and assistance is given to members. Book stalls and the Society's library are available at most meetings. The Society publishes a quarterly journal entitled Metropolitan free to members, containing news of Society activities and project work, articles, correspondence and notification of new members and their interests. The Society also participates in a worldwide exchange of journals with other societies who are fellow members of the Federation of Family History Societies; news of the work of others is thus made available, and many useful contacts may be made available through this medium.</td>
