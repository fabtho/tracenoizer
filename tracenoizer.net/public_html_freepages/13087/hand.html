<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" attorney general Janet Reno announced that the FBI would step up efforts to investigate computer security breaches. The announcement was met with both applause and skepticism within the industry. On one hand, security proponents believe that law enforcement has not paid adequate attention to the threat posed by hackers. On the other hand, many observers see law enforcement as an inadequate tool to cope with attacks that can be launched by anyone from trouble-making teenagers in rural California to hostile foreign governments. "Making it illegal doesn't stop hackers, especially if they're operating anonymously from offshore," said Peter Neumann of consultancy SRI International.">

 Jackie Click Here for Online Computer Training The Computer Lady is the most amazing newsletter. It has so many tips that the average computer user can use, not just stuff for the geeks. The keyboard shortcuts are a godsend for a lady who gets "mouse hand" from hours spent surfing. Cynthia I really enjoy your website and the helpful tips you dispense. Keep up the good work--I know there's alot of us out here that need all the help we can get (as an example, I get more help from your site than the help key in Word, which I find to be terribly cumbersome to use; sometimes you need firsthand experience, not some preprogrammed book).</td>

 Kagi is a payment service that lets you pay directly with a credit card or U. You make a one-time purchase with no need to sign up permanently or to read and accept some lengthy legal mumbo jumbo. If the payment is approved (credit cards get approved immediately), you will receive your registration code right away because it's handled automatically by Kagi's web site without me needing to process it by hand. This service also lets you pay with a Credit Card, and other options may also be available, such as bank transfers. You have to sign up with their service first, however, and it may take a day before I can send you the registration code (I have to do this manually).</td>
