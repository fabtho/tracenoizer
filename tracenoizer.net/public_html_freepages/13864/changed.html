No kids or marriages yet, I moved to Salt Lake City for 4 years, then came back to SoCal 2 years ago and bought a house in Santa Clarita which I hardly ever see. I look back and see how much I have grown and changed, sought and conquered, yet when I stop to think that so many years have passed I am totally awestruck. I transferred to Humboldt State University where I received my bachelor's degree in Social Science and my master's degree in Psychology, with an emphasis on school counseling - I know, I know - that was a bit predictable. I worked as a middle school counselor in Humboldt County for two years and then accepted an elementary counseling position in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho.">
