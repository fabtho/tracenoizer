<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" However, I might still consider doing some IronDoc coding, but at a much more leisurely pace that might actually be enjoyable in the absence of pressure. However, folks interested only in IronDoc should feel disappointment that the first useful IronDoc release is going to be delayed for a while. But this disappointment might be somewhat allayed if the first useful release of IronDoc is accompanied with a scripting language that can demonstrate the kinds of things I have been doing with IronDoc in testing. This change in focus is only a problem for prospective IronDoc developers who are waiting to use a really functional version of IronDoc. Since this is a principal goal of what I am doing, this delay has a very serious impact on my feelings, since it strongly affects my expectations about the rate of IronDoc adoption among developers who need something right now.">

 Please feel free to send me email about the various Japanese projects described on this page. I will try very hard to reply quickly, but I get a lot of mail, and long letters may take a while. If you are thinking of emailing me about other things, especially to ask me questions not related to my projects, please read this page first, as it may save us both some time. (Please note that I do not buy or sell ukiyo-e or any other Japanese art, nor do I appraise Japanese prints. Emailed requests about any of the above will usually be ignored.</td>

 have been able to search among many translations for those that catch the tone and intent of the originals most accurately; they have used versions by Stephen Spender, . chosen to represent each of Lorca's original volumes. He returns to Andalusian material, specifically to his native city of Granada, for images and atmosphere, among other things. Traditional ballad rhythms can also be heard here yet experimentation in rhythm and images and other techniques is also evident. Michael Smith is a winner of a European Academy Medal for distinguished work in the translation of poetry.</td>

 (Without actually admitting that that is his position). There was of course no such evidence, and no such endorsement. In the case of the Economist, there are no articles saying anything resembling the things that Chomsky suggests. On the contrary, the authority and prestige of the Economist opposes Chomsky's claims. In the case of the Far Eastern Economic review the review did indeed publish an article that said almost, but not quite, what Chomsky represents it has saying.</td>
