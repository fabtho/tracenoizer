 The objective was to make our institution a model of environmental excellence and sustainability -- a "green" University (GreenU). The initiative is unprecedented in that it covers all aspects of University life. This has been elaborated to include the full spectrum of the University's education and training programs; all of the various types of research it conducts; the health care and other services it provides; its management, organization, and operations; and its facilities, grounds and infrastructure. In so doing, GW will become more efficient and competitive -- with enhanced education, research, and service capabilities. The initiative at GW builds on the institution's already solid environmental history, including more than 20 years of environmental education, research, and service in diverse disciplines.</td>
