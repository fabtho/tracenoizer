 The holocaust in Cambodia is now well known, because in 1979 it became convenient for Moscow line communists to trumpet it to justify their invasion of Cambodia. Chomsky uses a multitude of long winded circumlocutions to deny that there was a bloodbath, while very carefully avoiding saying that there was no bloodbath. If you read the article below very carefully you will find that Chomsky does not actually say in so many words that the Khmer Rouge was similar to the French resistance , he merely leads the reader to believe it. He does not actually say that tales of mass murder are all a bunch of evil capitalist lies, he merely contemptuously condemns and ridicules those who tell the truth about Cambodia, while praising to the sky the (often entirely imaginary) sources that deny democide in Cambodia. He does not actually say in so many words that the press was giving undue and excessive attention to Pol Pot's Cambodia, he merely leads the reader to believe it.</td>

 This basic question is asked and answered here in some detail. (Note this page is turning out much larger than anticipated, so the current version is a snapshot of the document in progress. ) hypoknot The IronDoc hypoknot page describes the epiphany I had recently on the topic of late hyperbinding, which concerns a consistent computational model for unifying many forms of delayed expressions and late binding computations using similar ideas. Note the hyperbinding term was suggested by Luther Huffman. hiatus IronDoc is going on hiatus, for perhaps a few months, until issues clear at Netscape.</td>

 CORBA, for those who haven't heard of it before, stands for Common Object Request Broker Architecture. This architecture allows clients to invoke methods of objects running on remote servers. The idea is nothing new - many developers will have come across similar systems such as RPC (remote procedure call), or Java's own RMI (remote method invocation). Developers don't need to know what language a CORBA service is written in, or even where it is physically located. This makes CORBA systems very versatile - one can change the location of a CORBA object, and then re-register with a nameserver.</td>
