 Universities fulfill their missions when they develop new paradigms, explore new directions, infuse their students with fresh knowledge and ideas, and provide them with the tools needed to advance positive change. At The George Washington University, we have used this mission to shape, drive and make real our commitment to the environment and sustainability. We believe that the way to truly preserve our environment and our precious resources lies in affecting profound changes in behaviors and cultures -- those of learning, conducting business, performing our day-to-day domestic and leisure activities, and finding sustainable solutions for our shared future. To turn our University's behaviors and cultures toward those which value, embrace, and advance sustainability, we are developing the Green University Initiative. Moreover, the University will produce a new generation of graduates who will inherently embody and advance such values and ethics in their own lives, and in those of coming generations.</td>
