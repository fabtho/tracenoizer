 World War I is over, flappers are all the rage, and young Julie Jones longs for more than the satisfaction of caring for her widowed father and many siblings. Julie and her family live on a hardscrabble farm at the edge of Fertile, Missouri. By the time they reach the Jones farm, Evan is bowled over by this pretty, gentle young lady. Julie finds Evan attractive, but worries that he may be like his father underneath his gallant exterior. She soon finds nothing could be further from the truth.</td>

Evan Johnson has returned home to Fertile, Missouri after the war only to protect the family farm from being ruined by his father.
