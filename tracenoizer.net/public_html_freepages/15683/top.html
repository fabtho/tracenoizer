 Tennis Team takes 2nd in EDC Meet Times-Online Valley City Times-Record SPORTS Tennis Team takes 2nd in EDC Meet By Mary Berglund Times-Record Sports Editor Runner-up in regionals is the best any Valley City team has accomplished in tennis. Last spring the Hi-Liner girls did it; Saturday the boys matched it. To get to the top, Valley City first bested Grand Forks Central in round one. Evan Knodle won the final two sets to give Valley City a 3-2 win and a shot at the EDC title. But Grand Forks Red River had other ideas, downing the Hi-Liners 4-1.</td>
