 When you log in, you will see a flashing "ZenWorks" screen, then the App Explorer loads. The network places the folder on your desktop for you. Inside the folder are all of the icons for network software available to you. List This all works the same when students log in, they just see different icons inside the folder. Begin using the new Application Explorer to be sure it works on your machine.</td>

 Installations and support There's more to installing a computer than connecting cables together. we set your system up so all you have to do is use it. We provide basic training in the use of your operating system and core application software, and offer assistance in the everyday problems that can arise in using your computers. Many tasks may be accomplished by remote control- saving you time and money. We'll tell you what they are and how you'll benefit, based on your individual system and how you use it.</td>
