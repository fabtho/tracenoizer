 Back to Text Back to Top of Document Back to Contents . . The thesis is a study of the change of Element Order in early English and the causes of such changes. Early English is a valuable source of evidence for the ways in which language change can occur, for (as is well known) it underwent a change from a highly inflected language with relatively free element order to one in which grammatical function is expressed to a great degree by element order - which is comparitively fixed. It is hoped that by studying data from the period of greatest flux in the language - late OE to early ME - that some light will be thrown on the details of and reasons for such language drift.</td>
