 In the above example, differences in element order alone - despite some contradictory evidence - suggested the A section to be earlier. But an examination of other features showed that this could be explained, and gave strong evidence that it was the B section which was in fact the earlier. This shows that it is necessary to take into account a variety of evidence and determine whether or not it all (or mostly) agrees with a particular theory. It is especially important in the field of element order study where at some stages of linguistic development the word order seen may vary greatly for reasons of style, tradition and other reasons. Two contemporary OE texts might vary quite extensively in their element order, yet be very close in their time of composition.</td>
