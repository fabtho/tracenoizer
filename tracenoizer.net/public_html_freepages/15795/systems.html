 The projects and publications links below lead to fuller information about this and other work in the group. . Systems is the largest research area in the Computer Laboratory covering hardware, communications hardware and software, operating systems and distributed systems. Past systems developed here include Edsac, the Titan operating system, the Cambridge Ring and the Cambridge Distributed Computing System. The thrust is open distributed processing with an object orientated approach.</td>
