 "Written ePolicies and monitoring software are indispensable business tools for employers operating in the age of e-mail and the Internet," says Flynn. Monitoring is an effective eRisk management tool, but it cannot eliminate all workplace liabilities. While the federal Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) gives employers the right to monitor all e-mail traffic and Internet activity on the company system, it does not always prevent outraged employees from filing invasion of privacy claims.
