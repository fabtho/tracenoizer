E-Sign validates electronic contracts and signatures, but it does not have any effect on the legal rights or obligations of contracting parties. E-Sign does not have any effect on existing provisions of law, except that it preempts any existing law that requires signatures, contracts or other records to be in writing.">

 Plus, they are committed to meeting major client service standards annually as part of their service for each insured firm.

Annual Client ReviewSM An analysis of a business's property and liability insurance needs and an update on coverages desired, deductibles selected, and areas where no coverage is needed.
