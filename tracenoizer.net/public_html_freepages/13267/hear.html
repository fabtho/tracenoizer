 I spoke like a child; you destroyed me with a smile While I was sleeping I'm sick of love but I'm in the thick of it This kind of love I'm so sick of it I see, I see lovers in the meadow I see, I see silhouettes in the window I watch them 'til they're gone and they leave me hanging on To a shadow I'm sick of love; I hear the clock tick This kind of love; I'm love sick Sometimes the silence can be like the thunder Sometimes I wanna take to the road and plunder Could you ever be true. .

 I play an Authentic Tack Piano, Drums, Ukulele, and Vocals. I really love Ragtime music, so I had a lot of fun doing this. I would love to hear what you think of these songs. Feel free to email me your comments and questions about any of this. I will put more of my songs here soon, so check back often.</td>
