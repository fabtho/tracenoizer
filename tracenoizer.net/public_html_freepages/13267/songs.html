 The band have finished recording all backing tracks now, and there's some vocal parts that need a little bit of work from Joe, who's currently recording the last small vocal bits 'n' bobs. No more work needs to be done on these tunes at all. Pete Woodroffe is currently in Los Angeles at the legendary Rumbo Studios (famous for the studio used for the recording of Guns 'N Roses' APPETITE FOR DESTRUCTION, for example) to mix another bunch of songs, which are expected to be done very soon. In April, Pete will do additional mixing in London. Fifteen songs were recorded, although not all 15 will end up on the album -- the final tracklisting will most likely consist of 12 or 13 tracks.</td>

 . New Blur album sounds like 'Can meets Led Zeppelin' - NME. As previously reported, the group have recorded approximately 14 songs for their new album, and intend to go back into the studio next month to work more. Saying the follow-up to '13' is one of "the most radical things we've ever done", Albarn explained the band's progress. The emphasis has been on making something grow and getting it simple, but right.</td>

 The word "folk" (as in folk music) was misspelled in an amateur-press magazine some years ago, and it stuck. There are as many definitions and philosophies of filk music as there are filkers (those who sing it), and those definitions and philosophies tend to evolve over time. Many filk songs have original words or music or both, but are based on or inspired by a published fictional world, such as Star Trek or Pern or Babylon 5 or Dr. These can be about nearly any damn thing; a title, or lyric, or turn of phrase, or something can send the songwriter off into directions no one dared contemplate before (and many wish had not been contemplated now). Filk songs do not have to be related to SF or fantasy.</td>
