 When the time comes, I think we have a enough songs to choose from that would work as singles". "The artwork is moving along nicely", Joe explains. "We're working with someone who's new to us, which gives a fresh look on things. " One of the most asked questions (and rightfully so), is what the album sounds like.

 New Blur album sounds like 'Can meets Led Zeppelin' - NME. As previously reported, the group have recorded approximately 14 songs for their new album, and intend to go back into the studio next month to work more. Saying the follow-up to '13' is one of "the most radical things we've ever done", Albarn explained the band's progress. The emphasis has been on making something grow and getting it simple, but right. Depsite rumours that Fatboy Slim was to produce the record, is now seems he will only work on a couple of songs, much later in the recording process.</td>

 . Josh Bakehorn Here is some music I composed, performed, and recorded. These are basically crude demos of everything, so things are a little rough on the edges, etc. , but they stand as decent examples of some things I can do. I hate that these are in mono; it doesn't do the original stereo mixes any justice.</td>
