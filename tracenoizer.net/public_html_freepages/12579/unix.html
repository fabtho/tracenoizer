 The course was written to be given to students for self-study, with some tutorial support. It is intended however that it can be used entirely as a self-study course if necessary. While the course is intended for those learning to use Unix for language processing, the material covered is of interest to any users who wish to explore Unix and develop their own simple applications. The language processing techniques introduced here should be of interest to any user who wishes to handle text files. The course contains a series of exercises, to be found at the end of most chapters, plus some practice material inside the chapters.</td>
