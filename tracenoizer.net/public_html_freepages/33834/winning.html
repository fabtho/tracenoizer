 Absa paid R16 000 for Collen Maswanganyi's impressive wood sculpture titled Helicopter rescuing Mozambican Mother. The work depicts the rescue of a pregnant woman during the recent devastating floods in Mozambique. The second work purchased by Absa for R8 500, was the merit award winning work by Marco Cianfenelli titled Head II which comments on the current spate of farm killings around the country. The public is invited to view the exhibition of ninety-eight finalist works (chosen from 600 national entries) at the Absa Gallery, 161 Main Street, Absa Towers North, Johannesburg.
