The sense of revulsion one feels thinking about what happened at this place is cleverly encouraged by the artist through the use of blood as a medium. Absa paid R16 000 for Collen Maswanganyi's impressive wood sculpture titled Helicopter rescuing Mozambican Mother. The work depicts the rescue of a pregnant woman during the recent devastating floods in Mozambique. The second work purchased by Absa for R8 500, was the merit award winning work by Marco Cianfenelli titled Head II which comments on the current spate of farm killings around the country.">

 . Each artist was given one white T-shirt as a starting point for a work of art. The result is a fantastic variety of different works, ranging from paintings to lithographs and installation to sculpture. This exhibition showcases the Johannesburg Civic Gallery's aim to promote young and emerging South African artists from various backgrounds. This is a wonderful opportunity for some special end of year shopping and a healthy dose of creative culture.</td>
