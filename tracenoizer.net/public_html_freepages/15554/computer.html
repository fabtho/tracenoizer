 The program was designed to interface with an existing computer- aided component layout and routing routine and to be user interactive. . Computer-Aided Heat Sink Design for Printed Wiring Boards. Abstract A computer-aided design (CAD) program has been developed which generates a graphical layout of a printed wiring board (PWB) showing its fundamental characteristics, automatically performs a heat sink design for conductively cooled in-line PWBs, and sets up a working data base containing generated thermal characteristics for subsequent thermal and reliability analysis. The program was designed to interface with an existing computer- aided component layout and routing routine and to be user interactive.</td>

 Due to the one-of-a-kind nature of the NHP200NC, reproduction is impossible and orders are thus futile. . So do we, but instead of drilling holes and windows out of our computer cases to install cold cathodes, fans and plexiglass, we simply left the case away this time. But they're all heavy, rectangular and following a 20 year old de-facto standard. We wanted to change this and thought about a way how to transform a lab computer (just the parts put together, no case (as seen in testing labs at various websites)) into a portable shape.</td>
