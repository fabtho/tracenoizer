<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" There's always some form of additional cooling that you can add to your system that may just break the 'ole threshold. A hard drive may not produce super-extreme temperatures as compared to today's processors, although they do produce a fair amount of heat. Therefore, keeping your hard drive cool only aids in lowering overall chassis temperatures. This would be very useful for SCSI drives and RAID setups also. Second, hard drive coolers increase hard drive life.">

 The fluid-enhanced design offers a dry, lasting cooling effect, combined with cushioning support. On hot show days, keep your Canine Cooler in an ice chest when it isn't in use. Then it will be ready in an instant to cool your dog. Here is a fan you can hang on your dog's crate or set on the floor. It's very quiet, has two speeds and moves quite a bit of air.</td>

 Check out AnandTech FAQs on the Guides Front Page for the answer to this question and more. Industry Reports Click Here for news done right, AnandTech-style. But how do you cool Athlon MP processors in a case that's less than 2" tall. Read on as our resident cooling expert, Tillmann Steinbrecher puts all of the latest coolers through their paces and makes predictions for the future of socketed CPU cooling. The quest for more efficient cooling techniques has lead companies to experiment with everything from conventional air cooling to refrigeration.</td>
