 After the mudslides of 1999 which killed 15,000 people living in shanty towns on the steep hills surrounding Caracas, such options are desperately needed. . The military is buying fresh vegetables and meat in the countryside and trucking it to poor neighborhoods for sale at subsidized markets. The government now provides breakfast and lunch to children at school, which helped boost enrollment by one million over the last year. These are just a few of the social reforms began two years ago with the election of the left-leaning president, Hugo Chavez.</td>

 Appearing on television Sunday morning, the Venezuelan leader called for a national reconciliation. "I do not come with hate or rancor in my heart, but we must make decisions and adjust things," Chavez said at dawn Sunday. "Chavez was ousted from power Friday after his military refused to use as much force as he requested to stop a major protest. Sixteen protesters died when gunmen fired on a crowd of nearly 200,000 as it marched towards the presidential palace. Commanders accused Chavez of ordering the troops to fire, but he said the shooters were policemen linked to his political opponents.</td>
