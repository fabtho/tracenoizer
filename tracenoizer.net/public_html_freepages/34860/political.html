 What worries us is that they use information supposedly coming from the U. We are not the aggressors here we would like the U. government to respond on that because they quote highly credible sources from the political branches of the U.

 MEDIA However, few Venezuelans have gained from its wealth. Although during the oil boom this largely benefited the middle class, the subsequent collapse of world oil prices condemned many of this class to poverty while eroding the living standards of the already impoverished. What is more, a culture of non-accountability has combined with official corruption and political appointments in state-owned industries and government bureaucracies to produce a cumbersome, inefficient and poorly-maintained public sector and public services. In 1998 Venezuelans broke the stranglehold of the discredited party system to elect Hugo Chavez, a former army officer who promised to eradicate corruption and reform the public sector. But political unrest and deep divisions have characterised the president's term in office.</td>

 Over the next few years, Chavez would develop a support base and eventually be elected president. (Agence France-Presse) Chavez emerged from prison in 1994 as a popular populist figure. He enjoyed financial support from political groups that had been left out of the traditional parties' power-sharing agreements. The poor, the intellectuals and the traditional left also supported him. He ran for president in 1998 and was elected with 56 percent of the vote.</td>
