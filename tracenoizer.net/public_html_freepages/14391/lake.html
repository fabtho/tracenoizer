North Lake Tahoe Historical Society North Lake Tahoe Historical Society Tahoe City, California The North Lake Tahoe Historical Society was founded in 1969 and incorporated in 1971 by a group of concerned citizens who saw many of our landmark structures torn down in the 1960's to build condominium developments. Determined to preserve our local history, the non-profit, public benefit corporation dedicated itself to the study, preservation and interpretation of Lake Tahoe history. It's first major project was to preserve the Historic Gatekeeper's Cabin, then to rebuild the structure as a museum after it was destroyed by arson fire in 1978.</td>
