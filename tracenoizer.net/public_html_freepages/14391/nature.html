 At the same time, the Great Salt Lake is rising to record heights, flooding the Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge and scattering the birds and animals with whom Williams has lived her life. CommentaryWith it's beautiful and poetic, yet clear and readable language, this book stands out as one of the best of the illness narratives. The contrast of nature acting on the Great Salt Lake, as detailed by maps and water measurements throughout the book, against the natural--or unnatural--cycle and death of Williams' mother and grandmother is set to add to each story. ..</td>

 The sight of Bosch's nearly hallucinatory vision of life in all its elaborate fecundity sparked an epiphany so powerful Williams embarked on a life-altering study of the painting she chronicles. Williams gives herself over wholly to the experience, even writing from within the painting's lushly detailed and wildly inventive landscapes, an immersion that gives rise to extraordinarily revelatory leaps of thought. Williams' insights into Bosch's resonant work form an arresting inquiry into our relationship with nature, the divide between religion and spirituality, and the question of how to preserve wilderness. With each leap, she extends her definition of a "living faith" and discovers something new about our need for art and wilderness. Earth is art, Williams realizes, and at the very least, it deserves the same respect and protection accorded Bosch's triptych.</td>
