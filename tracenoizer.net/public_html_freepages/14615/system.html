 In the first case, I am interested in the technology of operating a modern digitally recorded regional seismograph network. Over the past few years I have been involved in the development of much of the computer software for the real-time detection, recording, and automatic analysis of data from the Pacific Northwest Seismograph network. Recent developments of this system include the adaptation of the Earthworm seismic data acquisition and processing system to our needs here in the Pacific Northwest. This system and includes near real-time event processing and alarms which notify staff members of large earthquakes or equipment failure. Field work in the eastern Cascades and on Mount Rainier provide a break from sitting in front of a computer all day.</td>

 ' Other than that, the two conditions are quite similar. In diabetes, you have a wide variety of clinical manifestations. It's the same basic problem which is lack of control of blood sugar, but some patients have significant amounts of kidney disease; other patients have a significant amount of arterial blockages; other patients have nervous system problems with the peripheral nerves - the nerves of the fingers and feet that aren't working properly. (See Table 1) I look at these as basically a central nervous system disorder with different subsets. We don't understand what causes these subsets and why they differ.</td>
