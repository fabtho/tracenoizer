 ., Chemical Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, 1974 Ph. edu ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Current Focus of Research Separation and Reaction-Separation Systems The design and synthesis of separation systems can be done systematically for simple mixtures, using simulation tools and heuristic approaches for the generation and ranking of alternatives. We are developing a new generation of tools for the design and synthesis of separation systems for complex mixtures, allowing for the possibility of azeotropes, multiple liquid phases, and simultaneous reaction and separation. The first generation of these software tools, applicable to mixtures without chemical reactions, has been completed; these tools are collected in the Mayflower software.</td>

 from Stanford University and degrees in applied mathematics, engineering, and psychology. . McGovern Professor of Information Systems at the MIT Sloan School of Management. Professor Malone's research focuses on how new organizations can be designed to take advantage of the possibilities provided by information technology. More recently he has described possibilities for future organizations such as an "e-lance economy" where electronically connected free-lancers, joining together in temporary teams, will perform many of the tasks now performed by large companies.</td>
