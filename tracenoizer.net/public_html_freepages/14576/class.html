 . Not just because as a 10 year veteran of the League his teams have commandeered 6 titles, nor because of his exquisite all-around play (hey, that's to be expected from a 6'5" former captain of Tufts University ('89) basketball team and star of the Israeli pro league), but because of his extraordinary sportsmanship and graciousness on and off the court. Steve is pure "class" and he demonstrates it again and again with his magnanimous treatment of teammates and opponents alike, support and encouragement of the refs, and his ever willingness to serve as emissary for the League (he even volunteers as assistant BB coach at Xavier High School--one of our facilities). In his other life, Steve works on the floor of the NYSE where he is managing director of floor operations for LL Partners. Annually he takes 15 or so of his clients (hedge fund managers mostly) to the Final Four (via charted jet), where he puts together a basketball tourney in which he and clients play and dine with lots of ex-pro's and current coaches.</td>
