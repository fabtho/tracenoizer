<meta name="Description" lang=" "content=" The songs on this CD cover almost every feeling on the emotional spectrum, and her voice never skips a note as she leads you down the path of heartfelt discovery. Songs like 'Ashes By Now' and 'The Healing Kind' give anyone who hears them reasons to see the heartbreak in the the world around them. But the cover tune, 'I Hope You Dance' shoots straight to the heart with its message of hope between two parting people. Country hasn't seen many CDs lately with this much musical integrity. 'I Hope You Dance' is a CD that will be remembered as one of Lee Ann's finest works.">

 Sometimes it will just be the feel or groove of a song, and I won't even pay much attention to the lyrics. Sometimes it's a great lyric that maybe says something that I really want to say. It has a great message -- one that I want to spread to people. I don't know if I can pinpoint exactly what it is that touches me. Sometimes it's a lyric, sometimes it's a melody or a groove.</td>
