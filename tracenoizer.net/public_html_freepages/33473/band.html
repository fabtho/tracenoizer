 ) At home, young Lee Ann would lie between the stereo speakers and when the weather conditions were right-absorb the music beaming in from the Grand Ole Opry. Instead of taking her senior trip with the rest of her class, she bargained with her parents for a visit to Nashville, where she toured Music Row. She quickly became a member of the school band, Country Caravan, and toured with it throughout the Southwest and Southern California. During her stay at Belmont, Womack got married, became a mother and stayed home for a couple of years. Then she began doing showcases around town and singing demos for other songwriters.</td>

 Even when her senior class took their final trip together, Lee Ann opted to make a trip to Music Row to open her eyes and hopefully build a few bridges toward a successful country music career. Lee Ann attended South Plains Junior College in Levelland, Texas at first upon graduation. There she became a member of the school band 'Country Caravan', which toured much of the Southwest. With her eyes on the future, she next enrolled in the Belmont University Music Business program. In 1990, Lee Ann decided to make the move to Nashville full time.</td>

 Often times I'll just find a writer like Buddy (Miller) or Rodney Crowell, somebody whose work I really like, and end up covering some of their songs. Frank is really responsible for finding songs, as is my other producer, Mark Wright. When you listen to a song demo, how important is the sound quality and that the tune be fleshed out with the texture of a full backing band. Do you try to stay true to that version of the song or do you find yourself re-arranging the song to suit your style. Well, I personally prefer demos that are just an acoustic guitar and a vocal.</td>
