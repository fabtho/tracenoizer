 After a year of producing two excellent examples of how country music should be sung, Decca's closing left some of us on the 'Row wondering where she might be going. MCA Records, the company that acquired Decca, realized very early Lee Ann still had a vast amount of talent that needed to be given the chance to grow. Her third CD, 'I Hope You Dance', is one of the finest musical offerings to come out of Nashville in quite a while. The songs on this CD cover almost every feeling on the emotional spectrum, and her voice never skips a note as she leads you down the path of heartfelt discovery.

 Audio clips from interviews with master songwriters and composers. " 2001 proved to be a career-defining year for Womack when she scored a monumental hit with the release of Mark D. Sanders and Tia Siller's "I Hope You Dance," a touching ballad with an emotional theme about the hopes and dreams a person wishes for the loved ones in their life. High lonesome heartbreak can be heard on the bookends of I Hope You Dance. I also heard your performance of "I Hope You Dance" at the ASCAP Country Awards was excellent.</td>
