 Great American Country Lee Ann Womack Page Lee Ann Womack With songs as intimate and plain-spoken as diary entries, Lee Ann Womack reminds us of the things that made country music so enchanting in the first place. Her peculiar magic is being thoroughly traditional without sounding the least bit dated. In her self-titled debut album, the Texas native weds the primal emotional power of a Connie Smith or Reba McEntire, to the sensibilities and dilemmas of modern women. But as the collection amply demonstrates, she's not all tears and torment. No Olympian ever trained harder for the gold than Womack has.</td>
