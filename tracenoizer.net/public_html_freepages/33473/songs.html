<meta name="Description" lang=" "content=" MCA Records, the company that acquired Decca, realized very early Lee Ann still had a vast amount of talent that needed to be given the chance to grow. Her third CD, 'I Hope You Dance', is one of the finest musical offerings to come out of Nashville in quite a while. The songs on this CD cover almost every feeling on the emotional spectrum, and her voice never skips a note as she leads you down the path of heartfelt discovery. Songs like 'Ashes By Now' and 'The Healing Kind' give anyone who hears them reasons to see the heartbreak in the the world around them. But the cover tune, 'I Hope You Dance' shoots straight to the heart with its message of hope between two parting people.">

 There was this electricity that I felt, and I still get that feeling even when it's my own bus and I'm about to get on it in the middle of the night to go somewhere. I really feel like this is what I was meant to do and I love it. All of these writers have created some of the most emotionally moving and memorable songs over the last few years. Sometimes it will just be the feel or groove of a song, and I won't even pay much attention to the lyrics. Sometimes it's a great lyric that maybe says something that I really want to say.</td>

 He encouraged the singer to participate fully in gathering material for the project. . Great American Country Lee Ann Womack Page Lee Ann Womack With songs as intimate and plain-spoken as diary entries, Lee Ann Womack reminds us of the things that made country music so enchanting in the first place.
