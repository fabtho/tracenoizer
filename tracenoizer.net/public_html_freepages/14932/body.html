So in your daily life you will find that you are affected and that you do manifest accordingly to the energies that you take into the chakra system, which in turn manifests as a physical symptom, through the nervous system of the body. The Nervous system being the wiring system of the chakra system. an emotional individual functions from what is known as the Solar Plexus chakra or energy center, so that particular energy center will be intensified to the 10th degree.</td>

They are also recommending that that the bodies are not immediately disposed of and that the scene of the killings is not disturbed prior to any investigative team having access to the area.
