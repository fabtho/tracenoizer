 The extensive changes that will be carried out in the next years behind the restored facades of the world famous museums become apparent. . It is part of a comprehensive communication concept which also contains a virtual 3D model of the site and an information system in the entrance area of the Museumsinsel Berlin. The main assignment was to structure the complex details and the current state of an ongoing discussion and to describe it visually in a simple way. In order to communicate the process of conception and realization concerning the architecture and the exhibitions we decided to make use of a three-dimensional information graphic.</td>

 According to his comprehensive way of thinking Daniel Libeskind also added musical aspects while planning the Jewish Museum. The rules of the twelve-tone music are connected to the architectural language of Libeskind. It includes the visitor in a process which reaches from the plan or composition of a musical fragment to its variations and performance to a virtual architecture. The rules of the twelve-tone music were a break with conventional musical habits. In a similar fundamental way Libeskind puts architectural conventions to test.</td>

 A costumer with a reliable simple solution will end up a lot more satisfied than one with an unstable complex piece of software that only maybe runs on odd days when the weather is good on some computers almost safely. . Before the Expo 2000 in Hannover opened the gates to the public and even before the real buildings were finished a virtual three-dimensional model gave an impression of the site. The emphasis was put on providing the future visitor with an impression of the architecture. To publish the data intensive realtime VR-model on a software which should run on as many computers as possible it was necessary to make a selection of panoramic views and movies of the VR-model and to create a user interface to present them.</td>
