 com Alexandra Papadopoulo, Chris Rehberger standard rad . . Dann besucht die Troubleshooting-Seite Die Verbindung von Design und Clubkultur ist die Idee von clubcraft. Udo Schloermann und Steffen Blandzinski, beide Dozenten des Fachbereiches Design und Medien an der FH Hannover lenken und gestalten clubcraft. Jeden ersten - oder auch zweiten ;-) - Mittwoch im Monat werden in der Cumberlandschen Galerie junge Designer und Projekte vorgestellt, die ungewoehnlich sind und sich durch mutiges Handwerk auszeichnen.</td>

 This project remains one of my favorites because a substantial advantage of the computer as a means of communication becomes visible in the dynamic character of the interface. . My assignment was to embed an adequate GUI conception and design into this existing installation concept. The user interface should contain a representation of planet earth with links located on it that could be triggered to then depicts the geographical route (traceroute) the information packages covers while the content of a website gets transferred. - The software will then generate a choice of selectable links that are related to this place.</td>

 To publish the data intensive realtime VR-model on a software which should run on as many computers as possible it was necessary to make a selection of panoramic views and movies of the VR-model and to create a user interface to present them. Somehow my memories are limited to the negative side effects that occur when humans work 72 hours without any sleep. During this project I discovered my ardent desire for solid project management and I learned that in case of little time you have to reduce the technological challenges to a manageable degree and try to convince with good graphic design and ideas instead. It is simply to risky to create software under time pressure and exhaustion. The quality of an application does not necessarily have to suffer if you reduce the number of features and the technological demands.</td>
