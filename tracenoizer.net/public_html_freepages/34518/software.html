 . Anhand eines virtuellen dreidimensionalen Modells konnte man einen Eindruck von der Expo gewinnen, bevor sie eroeffnet wurde, bzw. Um das datenintensive Echtzeit-VR-Modell des Expogelaendes in Form einer Software veroeffentlichen zu koennen, die auf moeglichst vielen Rechnern laeuft, war es notwendig, eine Auswahl von Panoramen und Kamerafahrten im VR-Modell zu treffen und diese durch eine Benutzeroberflaeche zu praesentieren. Im Vordergrund stand dabei, den kuenftigen Besuchern vorab einen Eindruck von der Architektur zu verschaffen. ) Tagen anzunehmen ist im Rueckblick schwer zu beurteilen.</td>

 This experimental projects examines the interplay of music and computer where the computer is regarded rather as a medium than as a tool. Thus the interactive art with its life proximity, communicative issues and reflection of the power of the modern technologies is well suited to be linked with the urban public space. is based on the leading thought that due to entertainment software a new medium is established. Meandering is an experimental videosoftware that explores connections between time movement and image. .</td>

 Hypertexts offer a comprehensive insight in japanese live of that time. Five guided tours make the shopping street which was about 700 meters long accessible from various perspectives. To achieve this it was necessary to create a software that enabled us to fill a database with the information needed. This was not only a huge amount of text in two languages but also the complex linking between the text and the large image. The tool that fulfilled these demands resembled very much the final CD ROM application but additionally offered the opportunity to enter the input and links necessary.</td>
