 An explaining module consisting of an interactive projection on a table (designed by Tobias Schmidt and Simon Haecker) which explains details of the building and states quotations is integrated in one room together with the free interpretation depicted here. . Besides the popular architecture of the Jewish Museum also other realized and unrealized projects are shown. According to his comprehensive way of thinking Daniel Libeskind also added musical aspects while planning the Jewish Museum. The rules of the twelve-tone music are connected to the architectural language of Libeskind.</td>

 It is part of a comprehensive communication concept which also contains a virtual 3D model of the site and an information system in the entrance area of the Museumsinsel Berlin. The main assignment was to structure the complex details and the current state of an ongoing discussion and to describe it visually in a simple way. In order to communicate the process of conception and realization concerning the architecture and the exhibitions we decided to make use of a three-dimensional information graphic. A sort of x-ray view of the whole complex offers information about the reorganization of the collections. The new entrance building will be the main access and will lead to the different subject areas of the promenade and the various collections.</td>

 . Before the Expo 2000 in Hannover opened the gates to the public and even before the real buildings were finished a virtual three-dimensional model gave an impression of the site. The emphasis was put on providing the future visitor with an impression of the architecture. To publish the data intensive realtime VR-model on a software which should run on as many computers as possible it was necessary to make a selection of panoramic views and movies of the VR-model and to create a user interface to present them. Somehow my memories are limited to the negative side effects that occur when humans work 72 hours without any sleep.</td>
