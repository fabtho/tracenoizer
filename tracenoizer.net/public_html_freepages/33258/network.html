 Its title, Mercury, confirms the connection to Mirror the previous exhibition, which included the works of six female artists. The themes of identification and otherness present in Mirror take on different readings for the artists involved in the present exhibition. Jiri Kratchovil's 'The Josef Project' is an ongoing inquiry into the life of Josef Evagora and the activities of the network called 'The Hive. The display contains fish tanks and movement sensors connected to a bank of computers which monitor the passage of the fish, and a soundtrack generated by the activity of the monitoring devices. While clearly recognisable, the tune appears disjointed.</td>
