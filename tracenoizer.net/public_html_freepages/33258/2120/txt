 Its title, Mercury, confirms the connection to Mirror the previous exhibition, which included the works of six female artists. The themes of identification and otherness present in Mirror take on different readings for the artists involved in the present exhibition. Jiri Kratchovil*s *The Josef Project* is an ongoing inquiry into the life of Josef Evagora and the activities of the network called *The Hive. The display contains fish tanks and movement sensors connected to a bank of computers which monitor the passage of the fish, and a soundtrack generated by the activity of the monitoring devices. While clearly recognisable, the tune appears disjointed. The artist has in fact taught himself to sing backwards, only to reverse the process, thus questioning the truth of a constructed image or sound. The encounter with an artwork can be an uneasy process, a position which is addressed by both Dirk Lambert and Oliver Krohn. The works, elegantly executed, refer to language as both an absurd construction and a space to be inhabited in a poetic sense.
