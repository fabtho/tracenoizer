 He called for a total end to immigration and once described Islam as a "backward culture". In a country where most politicians pride themselves on their low profile, Fortuyn stood out with his snazzy designer suits, two yapping dogs called Kenneth and Carla, and a statuesque butler. Born in 1948 in a conservative Catholic family in a small town in the Dutch northwest, Fortuyn went to the hippie mecca of Amsterdam in the 1970s to study sociology. He later became a professor but in the last decade made a name as a columnist and commentator, producing a dozen tomes on society and politics such as "Soulless Europe" and "Suffocating Netherlands". Immigration, a groaning health-care system where hospital beds are in short supply, and creeping unemployment all proved useful fodder for his populist pitch.</td>

 1500 GMT 09 May 2002 The Israel Defense Forces began a partial emergency call-up of reservists May 9 in preparation for an offensive in the Gaza Strip. Israeli military forces were massed on the outskirts of the Gaza Strip overnight in preparation for an operation targeting Hamas networks. 2010 GMT Israeli tanks and bulldozers entered the Gaza Strip town of Rafah May 9 and the army massed troops on the Gaza border, after the Israeli security Cabinet reportedly endorsed a Gaza attack in response to a suicide bombing that killed 16 people on May 7, the Israeli daily Ha'aretz reported. Gaza is the headquarters of most of the leadership of Palestinian militant group Hamas, which claimed responsibility for the bombing. officials said May 8 that the CIA made an unsuccessful attempt earlier this week to kill former Afghan Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the leader of a hardline Islamic group, by firing a missile from an unmanned Predator in Kabul, AP reported.</td>

 Protest mood Dutch party leaders are well aware that electorates across Europe have been in a mood to indulge protest votes against mainstream parties, which are seen as being dominated by technocrats and increasingly remote from people's lives. We saw it with the first-round success of National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen in the French presidential contest. We saw it with the latest local elections in Britain, where right-wing extremists of the British National Party won a handful of seats, and a man campaigning in a monkey suit was elected mayor on a platform of giving the town's children free bananas. But if Fortuyn's party does make a huge advance, it should not necessarily be seen as a further triumph for the extreme-right agenda across Europe. Fortuyn was careful to dissociate himself from Le Pen, whose anti-Semitic utterances and homophobia he detested.</td>
