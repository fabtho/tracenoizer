 Mr Fortuyn sent shock waves through the Dutch political scene after he and his followers won 17 of 45 council seats in March's municipal elections in Rotterdam with an aggressive nationalist and anti-immigrant platform. The May 15 parliamentary polls were seen as the next test of the far-right in Europe after the emergence of France's Jean-Marie Le Pen. The right-wing politician was shot after he finished a radio interview in the Media Park in Hilversum, 20 km from Amsterdam. A former academic and media commentator, he burst onto the political scene last year with a campaign to curb immigration. He directed his attacks at the Netherlands' growing Muslim community.</td>

 But chief public prosecutor Theo Hofstee said the man suspected of gunning down the gay anti-immigration Fortuyn on Monday had shed no light on the motive for the attack. The suspect will make an initial court appearance in Amsterdam on Wednesday, where prosecutors will ask for permission to extend his custody. Fortuyn was shot six times in the head, neck and chest by a lone assailant outside the radio station in Hilversum, a town about 12 miles southeast of Amsterdam. Stunned Dutch political leaders met Tuesday to consider postponing election. The prime minister appealed for calm, but the slain candidate's supporters fought with riot police near parliament.</td>

 Immigration, a groaning health-care system where hospital beds are in short supply, and creeping unemployment all proved useful fodder for his populist pitch. . They said a man in a baseball cap had opened fire as Fortuyn was about to get into a chauffeur-driven limousine in the central city of Hilversum after appearing on a radio show. "Pim Fortuyn is no longer with us, this is a deeply tragic moment," said a clearly emotional Prime Minister Wim Kok. "This is not just an assassination attempt on Pim Fortuyn but also on Dutch democracy," he said.</td>
