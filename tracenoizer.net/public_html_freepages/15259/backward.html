 Pim Fortuyn's message was as simple as it was for many offensive - there are too many immigrants. Although even Fortuyn's party clearly thought Australia's treatment of illegal immigrants was daringly radical. According to Pim Fortuyn, it's a medieval, backward religion. I have written a complete book about it and you can read it also in English by Mr Huntington. But most Fortuyn fans were ordinary Dutch men and women like this Rotterdam butcher.</td>

 But Professor Pim, as he liked to be called, shocked the Dutch establishment with a blunt call for repeal of the first article of the constitution, which forbids discrimination. His campaign sound-bites were as provocative as they were unforgettable. He called for a total end to immigration and once described Islam as a "backward culture". In a country where most politicians pride themselves on their low profile, Fortuyn stood out with his snazzy designer suits, two yapping dogs called Kenneth and Carla, and a statuesque butler. Born in 1948 in a conservative Catholic family in a small town in the Dutch northwest, Fortuyn went to the hippie mecca of Amsterdam in the 1970s to study sociology.</td>

 Like them, he took a tough line on the European Union and especially on immigration. Fortuyn insisted that Holland was "full up," and he wanted a stop to further arrivals -- particularly from the Muslim world. Controversially, he criticised Islamic culture as "backward" and condemned the failure of Muslims to assimilate with homegrown Dutch. Maverick, not racist But Fortuyn was a maverick populist, not a racist or an identikit extreme rightist. His party contains a number of black supporters, and Fortuyn backed efforts to help immigrants already in Holland to integrate.</td>
