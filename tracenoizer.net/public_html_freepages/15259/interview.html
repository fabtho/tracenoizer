 Mr Fortuyn sent shock waves through the Dutch political scene after he and his followers won 17 of 45 council seats in March's municipal elections in Rotterdam with an aggressive nationalist and anti-immigrant platform. The May 15 parliamentary polls were seen as the next test of the far-right in Europe after the emergence of France's Jean-Marie Le Pen. The right-wing politician was shot after he finished a radio interview in the Media Park in Hilversum, 20 km from Amsterdam. A former academic and media commentator, he burst onto the political scene last year with a campaign to curb immigration. He directed his attacks at the Netherlands' growing Muslim community.</td>

 . Pim Fortuyn, admired and hated, a man who provoked reaction, now a victim of extremes. Just last Friday, I went to his powerbase in Rotterdam to interview a man who, prophetically, was well aware of the dangers his views might provoke. That's dangerous for anybody who is a little bit famous in this country. His fame came seemingly from nowhere - with no political experience, he led a party that demolished the establishment in the Rotterdam city elections in March.</td>

 Bolton said the three states were breaching their obligations under international treaties by pursuing weapons of mass destruction. 1500 GMT 06 May 2002 An unknown assassin killed Dutch politician Pim Fortuyn of the rightist List Fortuyn party May 6. The 53-year-old was shot six times in the head, neck and chest after leaving a radio interview in Hilversum, 10 miles southeast of Amsterdam. Although right-wing by the Netherlands' liberal, tolerant standards, the openly gay Fortuyn was sharply critical of extreme right-wing European politicians such as France's Jean-Marie Le Pen and Austria's Joerg Haider. Opinion polls showed that List Fortuyn would likely be one of the leading parties in the new parliament; elections are scheduled for May 15.</td>
