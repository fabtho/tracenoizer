 . But chief public prosecutor Theo Hofstee said the man suspected of gunning down the gay anti-immigration Fortuyn on Monday had shed no light on the motive for the attack. The suspect will make an initial court appearance in Amsterdam on Wednesday, where prosecutors will ask for permission to extend his custody. Fortuyn was shot six times in the head, neck and chest by a lone assailant outside the radio station in Hilversum, a town about 12 miles southeast of Amsterdam. Stunned Dutch political leaders met Tuesday to consider postponing election.</td>

 Mr Fortuyn sent shock waves through the Dutch political scene after he and his followers won 17 of 45 council seats in March's municipal elections in Rotterdam with an aggressive nationalist and anti-immigrant platform. The May 15 parliamentary polls were seen as the next test of the far-right in Europe after the emergence of France's Jean-Marie Le Pen. The right-wing politician was shot after he finished a radio interview in the Media Park in Hilversum, 20 km from Amsterdam. A former academic and media commentator, he burst onto the political scene last year with a campaign to curb immigration. He directed his attacks at the Netherlands' growing Muslim community.</td>

 He called for a total end to immigration and once described Islam as a "backward culture". In a country where most politicians pride themselves on their low profile, Fortuyn stood out with his snazzy designer suits, two yapping dogs called Kenneth and Carla, and a statuesque butler. Born in 1948 in a conservative Catholic family in a small town in the Dutch northwest, Fortuyn went to the hippie mecca of Amsterdam in the 1970s to study sociology. He later became a professor but in the last decade made a name as a columnist and commentator, producing a dozen tomes on society and politics such as "Soulless Europe" and "Suffocating Netherlands". Immigration, a groaning health-care system where hospital beds are in short supply, and creeping unemployment all proved useful fodder for his populist pitch.</td>
