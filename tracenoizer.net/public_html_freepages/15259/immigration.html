 Police said a 33-year-old white Dutch male had been arrested, but there was no word on his identity or the motivation for the killing. Fortuyn sent shock waves through the Dutch political scene after he and his followers won more than a third of the council seats in the number-two city, Rotterdam, in March. His fiery calls to end immigration, and his attacks on Islam in a country where Muslims account for nearly one million of the 16-million population, struck a chord with voters.

 The May 15 parliamentary polls were seen as the next test of the far-right in Europe after the emergence of France's Jean-Marie Le Pen. The right-wing politician was shot after he finished a radio interview in the Media Park in Hilversum, 20 km from Amsterdam. A former academic and media commentator, he burst onto the political scene last year with a campaign to curb immigration. He directed his attacks at the Netherlands' growing Muslim community. He had been largely dismissed by the major parties, with many assuming he could not appeal to the traditionally liberal Dutch electorate.</td>

 But in the radio interview minutes before his death, he was asked how long he expected to live. . But chief public prosecutor Theo Hofstee said the man suspected of gunning down the gay anti-immigration Fortuyn on Monday had shed no light on the motive for the attack. The suspect will make an initial court appearance in Amsterdam on Wednesday, where prosecutors will ask for permission to extend his custody. Fortuyn was shot six times in the head, neck and chest by a lone assailant outside the radio station in Hilversum, a town about 12 miles southeast of Amsterdam.</td>

Fortuyn took a tough line on immigration, and he tied politicians of other parties into knots with his flamboyant style and direct way of debating controversial topics. Before his death, opinion pollsters suggested that Fortuyn's party, really just a vehicle for his personal views, could win 18 percent of the vote. That would be enough to make it the third-biggest party in the Netherlands and a likely partner in any right-wing coalition government.</td>
