 The flamboyant and openly gay Fortuyn, 54, took six bullets to the neck, head and chest.

 But in the radio interview minutes before his death, he was asked how long he expected to live. . But chief public prosecutor Theo Hofstee said the man suspected of gunning down the gay anti-immigration Fortuyn on Monday had shed no light on the motive for the attack. The suspect will make an initial court appearance in Amsterdam on Wednesday, where prosecutors will ask for permission to extend his custody. Fortuyn was shot six times in the head, neck and chest by a lone assailant outside the radio station in Hilversum, a town about 12 miles southeast of Amsterdam.</td>

 We saw it with the latest local elections in Britain, where right-wing extremists of the British National Party won a handful of seats, and a man campaigning in a monkey suit was elected mayor on a platform of giving the town's children free bananas. But if Fortuyn's party does make a huge advance, it should not necessarily be seen as a further triumph for the extreme-right agenda across Europe. Fortuyn was careful to dissociate himself from Le Pen, whose anti-Semitic utterances and homophobia he detested.

British daily The Independent reported May 10 that Blair made the pledge during a private meeting with his party's national executive committee, although the date of that meeting is unclear. and Pakistani forces are delaying anti-Taliban and anti-al Qaeda operations in South Waziristan, Pakistan, according to the Pakistani daily Dawn.
