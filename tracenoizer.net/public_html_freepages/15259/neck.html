 Professor Pim, as he likes to be called, shocked the Dutch establishment with a blunt call for repeal of the first article of the Constitution which forbids discrimination. . The flamboyant and openly gay Fortuyn, 54, took six bullets to the neck, head and chest.

Mr Fortuyn sent shock waves through the Dutch political scene after he and his followers won 17 of 45 council seats in March's municipal elections in Rotterdam with an aggressive nationalist and anti-immigrant platform.</td>

 But chief public prosecutor Theo Hofstee said the man suspected of gunning down the gay anti-immigration Fortuyn on Monday had shed no light on the motive for the attack. The suspect will make an initial court appearance in Amsterdam on Wednesday, where prosecutors will ask for permission to extend his custody. Fortuyn was shot six times in the head, neck and chest by a lone assailant outside the radio station in Hilversum, a town about 12 miles southeast of Amsterdam. Stunned Dutch political leaders met Tuesday to consider postponing election. The prime minister appealed for calm, but the slain candidate's supporters fought with riot police near parliament.</td>

 Animal rights campaigner Volkert van der Graaf, 32, has been charged with his murder. Fortuyn's body was displayed in an open white coffin, dressed in a dark suit, yellow tie and white shirt. The gunshot wounds to his head, neck and back were not visible. "Pim, we're proud of you," read a card from Fortuyn's family, atop a wreath of red roses near the coffin. Mourners carrying banners and huge photos of Fortuyn piled floral tributes in the cathedral.</td>

 Bolton said the three states were breaching their obligations under international treaties by pursuing weapons of mass destruction. 1500 GMT 06 May 2002 An unknown assassin killed Dutch politician Pim Fortuyn of the rightist List Fortuyn party May 6. The 53-year-old was shot six times in the head, neck and chest after leaving a radio interview in Hilversum, 10 miles southeast of Amsterdam. Although right-wing by the Netherlands' liberal, tolerant standards, the openly gay Fortuyn was sharply critical of extreme right-wing European politicians such as France's Jean-Marie Le Pen and Austria's Joerg Haider. Opinion polls showed that List Fortuyn would likely be one of the leading parties in the new parliament; elections are scheduled for May 15.</td>
