 .justanotherhomepage If you deliberately made your way here, thanks. I make my living drawing schematics and writing computer code. But thanks to the web, I can also try to satisfy an unending itch to understand how we learn and grow together as thinking individuals in this rapidly changing culture that we are now creating. It seems that a home page should properly represent the person for whom it is titled.</td>

 . Martin Mueller's Homepage Martin Mueller You're welcome. I used to work as researcher in the Programming Systems Lab (PSL) at the Computer Science Department of the Universitaet des Saarlandes as part of the Sonderforschungsbereich 378 (Collaborative Research Center). My research focus used to be typing and (constraint-based) program analysis in the context of concurrent constraint programming. In July 1998 I defended my dissertation on a related topic.</td>
