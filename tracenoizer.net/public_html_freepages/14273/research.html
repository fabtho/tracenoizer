 . Martin Mueller's Homepage Martin Mueller You're welcome. I used to work as researcher in the Programming Systems Lab (PSL) at the Computer Science Department of the Universitaet des Saarlandes as part of the Sonderforschungsbereich 378 (Collaborative Research Center). My research focus used to be typing and (constraint-based) program analysis in the context of concurrent constraint programming. In July 1998 I defended my dissertation on a related topic.</td>
