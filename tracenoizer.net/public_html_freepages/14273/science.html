 . Martin Mueller's Homepage Martin Mueller You're welcome. I used to work as researcher in the Programming Systems Lab (PSL) at the Computer Science Department of the Universitaet des Saarlandes as part of the Sonderforschungsbereich 378 (Collaborative Research Center). My research focus used to be typing and (constraint-based) program analysis in the context of concurrent constraint programming. In July 1998 I defended my dissertation on a related topic.</td>

 He achieved worldwide fame and respect for the three decades of his highly popular mathematical games column for Scientific American, yet he is not a mathematician. He is by every standard an eminent intellectual, yet he has no Ph. He has a deep love of science and has written memorable science books (The Ambidextrous Universe and The Relativity Explosion, for instance), and yet he has devoted probably more time and effort to -- and has been more effective than any thinker of the twentieth century in -- exposing pseudoscience and bogus science. His critics see him as serious, yet he has a playful mind, is often more amused than outraged by nonsense, and believes with Mencken that "one horselaugh is worth ten thousand syllogisms. " He is deeply knowledgeable about conjuring and delights in learning new magic tricks.</td>
