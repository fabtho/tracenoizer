 Eastern Ken, This link talks about the different options for 9x12 cameras. Absolutely no problem here getting sheet film of this size - Kodak, Agfa, Ilford, you name it. I think there are some German dealers on the web who may ship it worldwide. Eastern Peter, I had no idea that 9x12 was still available over there. Eastern I too have a Recomar 33, I think I have a film holder for it and so will use it some day.</td>
