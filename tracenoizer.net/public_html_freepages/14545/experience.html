 It will open its doors for inspiring staff to go out into the community to schools, community centers, retirement homes, libraries and anywhere there is curiosity and a thirst for learning. It will open its doors to volunteers with a passion for contributing their skills to the pleasure of finding things out.

It is about a family experimenting together with a laser, and about a grandmother and child engrossed in weaving. It will be a place to actively participate in the fundamental phenomena, processes and principles of science and art through direct experience, to understand and appreciate the value of science and esthetics for the benefit of improving and enriching human life.</td>

She believes the easiest and best tasting approach to a healthier diet is to take advantage of simple, robust cuisine from around the globe that is naturally low in fat, yet high in flavor.
