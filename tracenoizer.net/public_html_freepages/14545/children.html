 During these years, Ireland was experiencing extremely harsh conditions and life would have been difficult for many families. Andrew Kelly was the first of the family to leave his homeland. Mary and five of her adult children, arrived between 1852 and 1855, residing around the Tower Hill area. It is interesting to note here, that three of Andrew Kelly's children (Ellen, Patrick and Andrew) all married a Kelly. The family soon grew, although most stayed in the area, Patrick was the first to head north to Wycheproof and later Lalbert, where he raised his 10 children.</td>
