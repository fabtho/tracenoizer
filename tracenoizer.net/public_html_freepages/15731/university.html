 It will be before the Faculty Assembly tomorrow afternoon and before the Board of Trustees next weekend. Today let me indicate to you some proposals in the plan. The key theme of the document is improved quality-not changing the basic nature of Clark University, which is a source of pride, but commitment to do better those things that define Clark as a special university. The first cardinal priority of the new plan is to the recruitment of a high quality and diverse student body at Clark and, indeed, to more high quality students. Central to this goal will be some bold new Admissions strategies that will very significantly increase our applicant pool, allowing us to be more selective in admissions, and will increase our yield of those students we admit.</td>
