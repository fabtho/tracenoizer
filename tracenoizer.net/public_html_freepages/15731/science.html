 Your site truly amazed me with all the helpfull links and info. The links of chemistry sites are very useful to me. You've got lots of nice chemistry links (a weakness in my own science links page). ChemConnect provides an extensive online chemical suppliers directory. They also host the online Chemical Exchange which has which allows companies to post Chemicals Wanted, or Chemicals for Sale messages.</td>
