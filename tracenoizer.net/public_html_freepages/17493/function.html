 ABR rate allocation schemes can achieve high link utilizations by maintaining non-zero (small) queues in the steady state, and draining queues when the sources do not have data to send. The queue length (and queuing delays) can be controlled if part of the available bandwidth is used for draining queues in the event of queue build up. A simple threshold function can allocate such bandwidth to drain queues. Better control of the queues, and hence delay, can be achieved using more sophisticated queue control functions. Analytical explanation and simulation results consistent with analysis are presented.</td>

 . On Decentralization of Control Functions for Distributed Real-Time Motion Control - Trngren, Lind (ResearchIndex) A. To fully exploit the concept requires that modularity is obtained also on control function level. A framework for investigating and viewing the decomposition of real--time motion control functions is presented. INTRODUCTION In design of machines a mechatronic design approach may well lead .</td>
