 Output Control Functions The Output Control functions allow you to control when output is sent from the script. This can be useful in several different situations, especially if you need to send headers to the browser after your script has began outputting data. The Output Control functions do not affect headers sent using header() or setcookie(), only functions such as echo() and data between blocks of PHP code. In the mean time, the call to setcookie() successfully stored a cookie without causing an error. (You can not normally send headers to the browser after data has already been sent.</td>

 An optional package is a group of packages housed in one or more JAR files that implement an API that extends the Java platform. Optional package classes extend the platform in the sense that the virtual machine can find and load them without their being on the class path, much as if they were classes in the platform's core API. An implementation of an optional package may consist of code written in the Java programming language and, less commonly, platform-specific native code. Support for optional packages in browsers such as Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator is available through the Java Plug-in. A optional package is an implementation of an open, standard API (examples of optional packages from Sun are JavaServlet, Java3D, JavaManagement).</td>

 Line directives are not recognized inside configuration strings. ARCHIVES Many Click programs also accept ar(1) archives as configurations. The archive may also contain package code required by the configuration. The click-install(1) and click(1) programs will decompose the archive and install any package code before installing the configuration itself. o(8) kernel module will not accept archives; use click-install(1).</td>
