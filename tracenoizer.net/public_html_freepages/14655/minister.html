 The Popular Front, a leftist alliance against rising fascism, takes its first tentative steps. Internal divisions and conservative opposition to his fiscal measures lead him to resign and the Front to lose strength, but not before preventing the rise of fascism in France. Daladier returns as prime minister, and in 1939 he reluctantly commits France to World War II beside the British. The authoritarian Vichy government collaborates with the Nazis in plundering resources and deporting Jews. From London, General Charles de Gaulle calls for a French Resistance movement which fast gains strength.</td>

Although police investigations are not yet complete, the general presumption is that the recent anti-Jewish attacks in France are probably the work of youthful second-generation immigrants from Arab countries. The actions have been contemporaneous with the Israeli prime minister's declaration of war on the Palestinians. Angered by TV images showing bloody scenes from the occupied Palestinian territories, agitated by the tirades of Arab extremists against everything Jewish, Arabs in France go out hunting for Jews. To all appearances, only a few people have been involved so far, and they are not particularly organized.</td>
