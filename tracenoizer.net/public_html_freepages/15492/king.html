 The Sultan holds the boys prisoner for many years, and develops a particular attachment to young Radu. When the grown Vlad Dracula (Rudolph Martin) is finally released nine years later, he vows to avenge his father's death, to unite his people, and to liberate his brother Radu (Michael Sutton) from the Sultan. Vlad Dracula journeys to Hungary to ask for an army from King Janos (Roger Daltrey) with which he can overthrow the Turkish occupation and regain his kingdom. While dining with the King, Vlad meets Lidia (Jane March), the daughter of a Romanian nobleman. Despite the fact that she had intended to join a nunnery, Vlad and Lidia fall deeply in love and eventually wed.</td>
