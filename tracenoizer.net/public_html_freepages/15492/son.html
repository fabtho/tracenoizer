" Originally, this title came about because his father (also named Vlad) belonged to the Order of the Dragon, an order formed by the Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund for the purpose of defeating the Turks. The elder Vlad used the dragon symbol on his coins and went by the name "Dracul" ("dragon" or "devil").</td>

But most importantly, he discovers the undying love of a father. Through stories from family and friends, James is able to mold a three dimensional figure in his mind to replace the distorted and blurry one he had lived with.</td>
