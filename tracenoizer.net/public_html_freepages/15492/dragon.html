 Numbers that correspond to a game level will appear as the score. Blue Dracula When you first fight dracula with a whip you should use the exploding boomerang. Dragon Once again, use the exploding boomerang on the dragon while dodging the flames. Red Dracula Hit Dracula in the head with your sword but do not remain there for long, or you will get hurt by his spell. Dracula's Brides Use the stake or the rifle on the brides while you avoid them when they land.</td>

Vlad a prince, was a Knight of the Order of the Dragon. We know as David explains in his book that the bloodlines of the reptilians were often Kings, Queens, Princes, and Princesses. Is it possible that means that Vlad was part of those bloodlines.</td>

The Dracula's Castle was built on the edge of the Bran Pass and nowadays lures guests worldwide who wish to partake in the legend of the Count Dracula. He adopted a totalitarian leadership and fought against The Ottoman Empire scoring many victories.</td>
