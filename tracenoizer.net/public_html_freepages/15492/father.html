I knew of only one case of this kind in Sakaltutan. Haci Osman (H) had taken on an orphan child of his sister, who was also his father's brother's son's son's son (agnatic second cousin once removed). In another case, a young man had been adopted by his father's brother, and had actually inherited his adopting father's house and fields and set up his own family there.

 In the days that follow, James becomes increasingly drawn to the stories and images that bombard the airwaves. Five weeks later, James receives a letter from Istanbul that changes his life forever. The letter informs James of the death of his Turkish father whom he last saw when he was only three. Over the years, James had bitterly learned to forget the few images of his father, and bury his many questions about the mysterious man lurking deep within himself.
