 In the days that follow, James becomes increasingly drawn to the stories and images that bombard the airwaves. Five weeks later, James receives a letter from Istanbul that changes his life forever. The letter informs James of the death of his Turkish father whom he last saw when he was only three. Over the years, James had bitterly learned to forget the few images of his father, and bury his many questions about the mysterious man lurking deep within himself. But the letter is more than enough for the feelings to come racing back to the surface.</td>

 She gave Rosa the keys of all her treasures, made her the mistress of her palace, and let her do whatever she pleased. But let us now leave this lucky girl with the Queen of Night for a little while, and return to her sisters. Long they consulted together as to the best means of bringing about her death; and finally these wicked girls decided to obtain from a witch of their acquaintance an enchanted kerchief which would make the person wearing it appear to be dead. Well, they set out, and presently arrived at the palace at an hour when they knew that the Queen of Night would be absent and they might find their sister alone. They, on their part, pretended to be overjoyed at finding again the sister they had mourned as lost, and congratulated her on her good fortune.</td>
