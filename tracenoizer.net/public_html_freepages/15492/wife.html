 I am a freelance cartoonist, illustrator and Web designer living in Vancouver, British Columbia. I still work in traditional media, but since I discovered computer graphics and the Internet it's only natural that I spend more and more time in front of my computer. My wife says that actually I LIVE in the Internet, but I have to say I disagree. After all, I still cannot take a virtual bath, and that seems to solve the 'existential' dilemma. But anyway, being a computer art geek is a diagnosis.</td>
