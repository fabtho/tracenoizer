 Statement from Assemblyman Jim Morrissey Statement from Assemblyman Jim Morrissey ASSEMBLYMAN, SIXTY-NINTH DISTRICT ORANGE COUNTY The following statement is released by Friends of Jim Morrissey P. That is why I have worked so hard as an Assemblyman on behalf of the Vietnamese people -- both here in California and in Vietnam. A few months later, I went to Vietnam - at my own expense - to try to win the freedom for Jimmy Tran and nine other Vietnamese American political prisoners. This past spring I sponsored the Southeast Asian Genocide Remembrance Week to call attention to the suffering of the people of Vietnam and other nations under the communists. On April 30, I wrote President Clinton, again asking him to help win freedom for Jimmy Tran and nine other Vietnamese American political prisoners.</td>

 . Also tying for first place were undergraduate students Eric Walton and Joseph Kim. Honorable mentions went to undergraduate students Jimmy Tran, Karen Lam and Lynley Lys, and to staffer Carol Wood, scholarship program coordinator in the Financial Aid-Undergraduate Scholarship Office. The award is the only campus prize open to students, faculty and staff alike, and is given each year through a special fund set up in 1970 by philosopher Eric Hoffer. Hoffer believed that every idea could be expressed in less than 200 words.</td>
