 For more information send e-mail to Linda DeLucchi or call 510-642-8941. . LHS Full Option Science (FOSS) FOSS (Full Option Science System) FOSS is an elementary school science program developed at the Lawrence Hall of Science with support from the National Science Foundation. FOSS program materials are designed to meet the challenge of providing meaningful science education for all students in diverse American classrooms and to prepare them for life in the 21st century. FOSS incorporates time-honored methodologies such as hands-on inquiry and interdisciplinary projects with contemporary methodologies such as multisensory observation and collaborative learning groups.</td>

 The SSDS customer community ranges from the NASA and international space science research communities to students, educators and the general public. . The Space Science Data System is the confederation of groups supported by NASA's Office of Space Science to provide public access to and to ensure the usability of science data from OSS missions and selected other data. Some SSDS groups develop tools and services for finding and using these data. Long-term data accessibility is ensured by SSDS archiving and preservation of the data.</td>
