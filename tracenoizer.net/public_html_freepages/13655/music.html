 Both album sounds like angry and frustrated white boys making a point of being angry. Like, "God damn, I am so pissed off, let's record the vocals on red levels so it sounds like I am screaming". So when the music is loud enough, no one can hear you scream. The thing is that Holmes has not a clue about rock music, he does not have the musical connections to rock music - it takes more than just ambition to rock to make a rock record. Rock music died five years ago and if Holmes thinks he can do anything decent from a buried dinosaur, that will be his loss.</td>
