 SEPTEMBER 99 - MARTINA'S ALBUM An interview with Tricky in the Italian music magazine 'Il Mucchio Selvaggio' confirmed that Martina's solo album will soon be released, finally. . I just did four tracks on her album; I didn't even want to do that, but I have to because she's the mother of my kid, and I love her. Meanwhile also the '15 Minutes' soundtrack has been released, which features the Martina-David collaboration 'Out Run'. MARCH - "NEED ONE" According to Worldpop Martina's album will be released this summer.</td>

 He's no stranger to films with all his albums so far having a cinematic feel. . David Holmes' album, 'Bow Down To The Exit Sign', is being made into a movie. That was always the concept behind the album, but now David's seeing the production take shape. We've actually got two major producers on board now and a possible director or two and lots of un-actor type people.</td>
