 He's no stranger to films with all his albums so far having a cinematic feel. . David Holmes' album, 'Bow Down To The Exit Sign', is being made into a movie. That was always the concept behind the album, but now David's seeing the production take shape. We've actually got two major producers on board now and a possible director or two and lots of un-actor type people.</td>

 But I still wanted to keep that strong, electronic angle in there. . The same holds true with his latest, Bow Down to the Exit Sign (1500 Records), but the motivation was different this time. Using vocalists for the first time, Holmes went to great measures to re-create the gritty Performance vibe. Rather than rigid, regimented loops and sounds darting in, I work a lot with layers of sound.</td>
