 All the main characters spend an evening on more drugs than can be counted while relaxing in a jazz club. Over all Let's Get Killed's use of samples, recorded conversations, and jazz influences dictates the relaxing nature of how nicely jazz can compliment modern dance. I would be very surprised if it doesn't end up on a soundtrack. ..</td>

 That was always the concept behind the album, but now David's seeing the production take shape. We've actually got two major producers on board now and a possible director or two and lots of un-actor type people. As well as all the movie soundtrack work he's doing, he's been sent a. He's no stranger to films with all his albums so far having a cinematic feel. .</td>
