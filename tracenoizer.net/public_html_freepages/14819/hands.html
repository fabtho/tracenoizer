 You are then dealt a hand of five cards, all of them dealt face up. The dealer also receives five cards; four dark cards dealt face down and one card face up. The player and the dealer compare hands formed from their five cards. If you wish to challenge the dealer, you must place a bet by pressing the BET button. When you receive a good hand, you naturally place a bet to challenge the dealer.</td>

 However, in the long run the dealer will qualify 56. Even the best possible bluff--where the player holds an Ace or King, another card which matches the dealer's upcard, and a four-flush of the same suit as the dealer's upcard--is unfavorable. This means that a player who always folds hands worse than Ace-King will lose less in the long run than one who sometimes bluffs. A bet on even the worst possible pair--deuces, with no Ace nor King, no card matching the dealer's upcard, and no card of the same suit as the dealer's upcard--yields an expected profit. This means that a player who always bets a pair of deuces or better will lose less in the long run than one who sometimes folds such hands.</td>
