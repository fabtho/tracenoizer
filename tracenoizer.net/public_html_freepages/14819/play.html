 Once the dealer stands, the hands are compared and the hand closest to 21 is paid. The simplest way to get exactly 21 is to hold an ace and either a face card or a ten. There are many ways of playing Blackjack, but our advice to everyone is to study the game, develop your own strategies, play error-free and consequently become a winner. You must always split Aces and 8's, no matter what the dealer's up card is. Always remember that when you play blackjack it's you against the dealer.</td>

 Bookmark us, so you can remember where you saw that Cribbage book. . Points are scored mainly for combinations of cards either occuring during the play or occuring in a player's hand or in the cards discarded before the play, which form the crib. The player cutting the lower card deals and has the first crib. The deal then alternates from hand to hand until the game is over.</td>
