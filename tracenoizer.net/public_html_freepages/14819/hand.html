 To begin, you receive two cards and the Dealer receives one. Face cards count as 10 and all other cards count as their face value. If you have Blackjack (an ace with a face card or 10 card), and the Dealer does not have Blackjack, you win the hand and odds are paid at 3 to 2. If you have Blackjack and the Dealer also has Blackjack, the hand is declared a standoff (you get your bet back). If after your first two cards are dealt you do not have Blackjack, you may opt to draw another card.</td>
