 After each game has been played, the used cards are shuffled back into the deck. If the total of your cards exceeds 21, you 'bust' and lose your bet. If you have the same total as the dealer, from 17 and up, it is a push. The dealer must draw cards until he has at least 17, and must stand at 17 or higher. The dealer may not decide whether or not to draw a card based on your hand, but must abide by the existing dealer rules.</td>
