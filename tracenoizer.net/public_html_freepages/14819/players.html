 The crib will count for the dealer - non-dealer will try to throw cards that are unlikely to make valuable combinations, but must balance this against keeping a good hand for himself. Dealer, on the other hand, may sometimes find it pays to place good cards in the box - especially if they cannot be used to best advantage in hand. In this stage of the game the total value of the cards played by both players must not exceed 31. As each card is played, the player announces the running total. If a card is played which brings the total exactly to 31, the player pegs 2 claiming Thirty one for two as he does so.</td>

 One of the dealers cards is dealt face up, the others face down. At this point the player may choose to fold or to raise. If the player chooses to fold at this point, the game is over and the players ante is lost. If the player chooses to raise then a bet of twice the ante is placed and the dealer's hand is turned over and compared to the players hand. If the dealer's hand is better than Ace King high, then it is considered a qualifying hand.</td>
