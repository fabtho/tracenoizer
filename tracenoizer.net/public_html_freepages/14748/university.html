 During that time, I've sat through more than my share of commencement speeches. But before I do, I would like to congratulate and give my best wishes to the class of 1996. You may not realize it, but you did the most difficult, challenging, and honest work of anyone in the university. You learned new things, and made your brains work in new ways. Not everyone at the university is so nobly and gainfully employed.</td>
