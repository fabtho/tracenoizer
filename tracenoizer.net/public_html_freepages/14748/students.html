 You learned about programming algorithms using recursively defined procedures---first you curse, and then you recurse. You learned how to do mathematical proofs, and how to multiply matrices and compute cross products. Well, you students didn't venture out into this risky unknown, fraught with the danger of showing how ignorant you were precisely when everybody was watching, just out of youth and curiosity.
