 In the meantime, we are frantically preparing for the PanAsia E-Commerce Training Workshop, 16-19 August . . The data that I have received is truly remarkable in bearing out the multiplier effect of PAN support. I am sharing the data with external reviewers who are carrying out an evaluation exercise on PanNetworkingGlobal, PanAsiaNetworking and PanLatinAmericaNetworking. For those who have not yet submitted their data, let me assure you that I am still very interested in receiving them and getting them collated, as an external indepth evaluation of PanAsiaNetworking is scheduled for sometime towards the end of 1999.</td>

 To avoid ambiguity, we call pre methods those functions that become methods once embedded into objects. We take the point of view that inheritance means pre method reuse, and that classes are collections of interdependent reusable pre methods. The inconsistency of name matching rules becomes a problem in distributed environments, where type definitions and data may migrate outside the compiler or program run in which they are created. Since these languages also rely on subtyping, structural subtyping becomes an issue. though M Lib matches I Lib , M Usr matches I Usr , and I Usr matches I Lib , it may be the case that P Usr produces runtime type errors.</td>
