 As a geographically isolated project (both participants are from New Zealand), one of our primary motives is to explore the notion of using online broadcasting media to critique geographical distance as an impediment to creative collaboration. . His work with the company ranges from designing real time computer interactive systems, real time vision orchestration, new applications of telecommunications systems to deliver interactive art as well as overall concept and direction of image, choreography and technology.

" Page 1 Barraged by friends, manhandled by Internet marketing hype, you (poor soul) have decided it's time to descend into deeper levels of online content hell by making some of your own sounds available using streaming audio technology. You may have noticed that simply attempting to listen to Internet audio is confusing enough. Competing online audio-technology companies desperately weave spells to charm bemused users into believing their Version Nine Million and Twelve product -- though ever so similar to that other company -- is the real deal. Maybe becoming an online DJ yourself will be more effort than it's worth. There are now lots of easy-to-use tools that can have you broadcasting your own live online radio show in just a few hours.</td>
