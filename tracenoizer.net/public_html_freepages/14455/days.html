 I liken Rebecca to a PC with no printer or screen for feedback - but she certainly had the keyboard and the cpu. I asked about Rett Syndrome and couldn't believe it when she said they were working with people with RS. I went straight home and told Rebecca about Missie, and that I knew she understood every word I said - Rebecca didn't stop smiling for days. The problem was that no-one in Auckland knew anything about FC. then I remembered the telephone and just rang her up one day.</td>
