 This collection is intended to demonstrate some of the more advanced features and to test the correctness of the compiler and simulator. C source code for a table preprocessor Some documentation for the table preprocessor The table preprocessor extends the Iowa Logic Specificaiton Language with truth tables, automatically translating such tables into random logic with the same behavior. Notes on Large Scale System Design The logic simulator can be used to simulate huge systems, but such systems require serious attention to issues normally classified as software engineering issues, and not normally the focus of hardware designer's work. Suggestions for graphics extensions This set of suggested extensions to the Iowa Logic Specification Language allows graphical editing truth-table specification. .</td>
