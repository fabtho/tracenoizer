Plus, the scripting language supports conditional logic too, like IF CONNECTED and IF SUCCESS so you can build more complex logic into your processes. Writing and executing scripts A script is just a list of commands in a text file or a TStringList. Scripts must be "prepared" before they're executed with a call to the Script component's PrepareScript method. This method effectively compiles the script commands in memory so that the Script component can then execute each command in its proper order.</td>
