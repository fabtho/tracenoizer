 The Habsburg Empire took Bucovina (the northern part of Moldavia) in 1775 and Russia annexed Basarabia (eastern Moldavia) in 1812. Following the Russian-Turkish War (1828-1829), Moldavia and Walachia gained their independence from the Ottomans. In 1859 the two Principalities were unified and Romania became independent. Alexandru Ioan Cuza was elected ruler of Walachia and Moldavia. In 1862 he created a national state, named Romania and Bucharest was proclaimed capital.</td>
