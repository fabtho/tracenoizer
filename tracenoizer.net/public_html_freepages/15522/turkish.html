 When the Roman army departed from Romania in 271 A. , a new period of unrest began, with numerous bands of migratory people traversing the territory. The X - XII centuries are known for the Turkish and Mongolian invasions . In terms of religion, the pervasion of Christianty in Romania is founded in the VI and VII century when Christian teachers began to arrive on its soil. Ultimately, the Church followed the Slavic faith, and today Romania is mainly an Eastern Orthodox country.</td>

 As the condemned struggles, the executioner pushes the stake inside his body. After leaving Transylvania and seizing the Wallachian throne in 1436, their father began a successful six-year reign. The following year, in 1443, Vlad II changed his position and decided to abandon his alliances with the Hungarians and prove his loyalty to the Turkish Sultan. Next, history repeated itself, and Dracula decided to abandon his ties with the Turks and sought help from the Hungarian king. What followed, was a reign of power, but above all, justice.</td>
