 .CMST Tech Summary - Secondary Ion-Mass Spectrometry Analysis Development and Evaluation 2. TECHNOLOGY NEEDS DOE has many contamination problems that require the determination of contaminants that adhere tightly to waste, environmental, and industrial surfaces. There is a critical need in DOE and industry for characterization technologies that are fast, inexpensive, and can address surface contamination. Technologies capable of salt fingerprinting, and determining chemical speciation are needed to reduce the number of analyses needed, and to improve the estimation of tank energy content (critical for risk assessment associated with tank characterization and remediation activities).</td>

 AAA92 Paper presented at the session on "VIRTUAL COMMUNITIES", sponsored by the Society for the Anthropology of Work and the Society of Psychological Anthropology in the 91th American Anthropological Association Congress, hold in San Francisco, Dec. School of Computer Science 4615 Wean Hall Carnegie Mellon University Pittsburgh. It also attempts to analyze the meanings of this culture in an American high technology university. This study is based on two year fieldwork at Carnegie Mellon University in 1990-1991 as part of a research project between technologists at CMU and anthropologists from University of Barcelona. Funding is by Centre Divulgador de la Informatica de la Generalitat, a Catalonian public computer company.</td>
