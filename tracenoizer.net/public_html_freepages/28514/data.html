These reports are designed to answer general questions about UW System student headcount, full-time equivalent enrollment (FTE), and degrees conferred. Student headcount and FTE data are based on the Fall term while the number of degrees conferred use complete fiscal year information (July 1-June 30). Data reported are compiled from the Central Data Request (CDR). As part of the CDR, each of the institutions in the UW System submits student and curricular unit-record data electronically to the Office of Policy Analysis and Research at UW System Administration.">

 Distance Mean distance (semimajor axis) between centers x1000 km. . Some of this data, especially for the smaller satellites, is not very accurate in the first place. Furthermore, orbits vary slightly over time due to gravitational interactions. The accuracy of mass and density data is also limited by the uncertainty in the value of the gravitational constant.</td>
