 Wheatley wood boxes Manufactured from premium hardwood. Each box is individually machined from either solid oak, cherry, black walnut or Brazilian mahogany. The boxes are finished with three coats of clear hand applied varnish which shows off the beautiful wood grain to the max. All boxes are fitted with top quality hinges and clips and a solid brass nameplate suitable for engraving. I am very happy to be able to use the PayPal Shopping Cart and accept credit card payments through PayPal, a secure internet payment service.</td>
