Basicly Rob has a band in which he greatly enjoys the music they create together and feels that as a group they have great potential (a rarity for some of us) but he has the dilema of not being able to get a job in his chosen field except for out of town locations and he doesn't want to leave this great opurtunity in staying in this band. I was in a band that I felt extremly comfortable with and there musical 'ideals' i guess, were along the lines of my own. I really loved to practice with them because I knew something new and exciting would occur when we did.">

 Here's what this extraordinary researcher had to say. What do you most like about being a research scientist. For me it is an ideal combination of hobby and job. If some experiments do not work and you can not find out the reason. That some plant viruses have a glycolysated coat protein.</td>
