 . Did you know that there are plenty of ladies out there who are taller than you. They wear mini-skirts or tight(ish) trousers, they use plenty of make-up and therefore make a painting by Michelangelo look pale - they also wear wonder-bras, have facelifts or whatever. After all there is nothing wrong with getting noticed, or is there. If you are tall and think you're getting a rough deal in regard to clothes and shoes let me suggest you write an email to Oprah Winfrey.</td>
