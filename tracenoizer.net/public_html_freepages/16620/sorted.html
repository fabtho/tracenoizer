 Strictly speaking, the heap allocation costs is a parameter of the runtime-system. However, in our underlying machine model allocating heap is such a basic operation that one can think of it as a special instruction. Priority sparking The spark queue is sorted by priority. This guarantees that the highest priority spark is turned into a thread. Priority scheduling The thread queue is sorted by priority, too.</td>

 New designs are being added regularly so if you do not find what you want listed it is always best to telephone to see if we have anything suitable since the catalogue was compiled. If you purchase a chart only pack you will receive a graph, a key for thread colours, basic instructions, and a picture of the finished design. If you purchase a kit you will receive all the above plus 14 hpi Aida fabric (unless a different arrangement is made), plus cut and sorted thread on a useful organiser. Stitch count is given in preference to size to enable the stitcher to calculate the size of the finished work using any fabric they choose. To calculate the size divide the stitch count by the hole count of the fabric.</td>
