 Links I guess everyone has to leave the nest at some point. and to make sure you fly instead of fall, I'm extending this list of places out in the wide blue yonder, all of them well worth visiting. It's run by Serendipity, whose stuff you should definitely check out. Something for everyone regardless of which genre or pairing you're a fan of. If they don't have what you're looking for, there's a huge annotated links database.</td>
