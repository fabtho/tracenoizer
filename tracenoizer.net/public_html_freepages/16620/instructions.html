 In the unlikely event of you not being entirely satisfied, return the items concerned in a clean and resaleable condition within 14 days of receipt and your money will be refunded or credit given. New designs are being added regularly so if you do not find what you want listed it is always best to telephone to see if we have anything suitable since the catalogue was compiled. If you purchase a chart only pack you will receive a graph, a key for thread colours, basic instructions, and a picture of the finished design. If you purchase a kit you will receive all the above plus 14 hpi Aida fabric (unless a different arrangement is made), plus cut and sorted thread on a useful organiser. Stitch count is given in preference to size to enable the stitcher to calculate the size of the finished work using any fabric they choose.</td>

 This value does not contain the overhead caused by the communication between the processors. The options in this section specify the characteristics of the microprocessor of the simulated parallel machine. To this end the instructions of the processor are divided into six groups. These groups have different weights reflecting their different relative costs. Set weight for arithmetic operations to n machine cycles.</td>
