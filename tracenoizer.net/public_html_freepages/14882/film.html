 Yet every day you can find another abused child drugged out at Prague's main train station. . color) "CREMASTER 5, the third film in Matthew Barney's CREMASTER saga, is a hymn to potential, a lamentation on hubris. With Budapest as its backdrop, it features some of the most dazzling visual moments ever rendered on film by an artist. In one extraordinary scene, set in an ornate bathhouse, we see seven submerged sprites attaching seven Jacobin pigeons to the Giant's scrotum as he stands thigh-deep in water.</td>

 . A series of five films exploring themes of confinement, transformation and freedom, the Cremaster films are baroque in appearance, primal in tone and impossibly complex. The film also features synchronized equestrian maneuvers staged at the Bonneville Salt Flats at Wendover, Utah; an 1893 performance in Chicago by Houdini; the taming of a Brahma bull; an actor portraying Johnny Cash, who supposedly telephoned Gilmore shortly before his execution; and a virtual Mormon Tabernacle Choir. The films have been shot out of sequence, and Cremaster 2 was actually the fourth completed. The first in the series takes place in a football stadium in Boise, Idaho; the fourth revolves around a sidecar race on the Isle of Man; and the fifth episode (which was seen at the Nuart in 1998) was shot in the baths and theaters of old Budapest.</td>
