 Barney takes this overripe palatial aesthetic and makes it into an art for the 21st century. The cremaster is the muscle in the male genitals from which the testicles are suspended (and which retracts them in cold or fear). Barney's 'Cremaster' is a massively ambitious project centred on five films, of which four have been shown to date - Cremaster 4 in 1994, Cremaster 1 in 1995-96, Cremaster 5 in 1997 and Cremaster 2 in 1999. The entire series is to be exhibited at the Guggenheim, New York, in 2001. Barney follows them up with objects, photographs and books that elaborate their imagery.</td>

 This intermingling of sports and art informs his work as a sculptor and filmmaker. After graduating from Yale in 1991, Barney entered the art world to almost instant controversy and success. The title of the films refers to the muscle that raises and lowers the male reproductive system according to temperature, external stimulation, or fear. The films themselves are a grand mixture of history, autobiography, and mythology, an intensely private universe in which symbols and images are densely layered and interconnected. The resulting cosmology is both beautiful and complex.</td>
