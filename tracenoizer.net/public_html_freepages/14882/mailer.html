 It was hard to pin down in a art climate awash in politically charged work that seemed to shun with a vengeance poetry or ambiguity. I had not a clue as to what Barney was up to in these works, but it looked great and suggested some strange sexual tensions.

 In this exhibition, the Walker Art Center presents the world premiere of Matthew Barneys latest film, Cremaster 2. n this installment of Barneys ongoing Cremaster cycle, an elliptical narrative unfolds around the films anti-hero, convicted killer Gary Gilmore, who is played by Barney himself. Loosely based on the life of Gilmore as chronicled by Norman Mailer in his book The Executioners Song, the film moves from a glacier field in the Canadian Rockies to the Bonneville Salt Flats, from Utah in 1976 to Chicago in 1893. Featured in the cast of Cremaster 2 are Norman Mailer and Dave Lombardo, former lead drummer for the band Slayer. Composer Jonathan Bepler provides the original musical score for the film, with vocals by Steve Tucker of Morbid Angel and Patty Griffin.</td>
