 Crossing from sculpture to film to video, he seamlessly creates dramas of compelling, compulsive force that inhabit a zone between the psychological and the physical. In this exhibition, the Walker Art Center presents the world premiere of Matthew Barneys latest film, Cremaster 2. n this installment of Barneys ongoing Cremaster cycle, an elliptical narrative unfolds around the films anti-hero, convicted killer Gary Gilmore, who is played by Barney himself. Loosely based on the life of Gilmore as chronicled by Norman Mailer in his book The Executioners Song, the film moves from a glacier field in the Canadian Rockies to the Bonneville Salt Flats, from Utah in 1976 to Chicago in 1893. Featured in the cast of Cremaster 2 are Norman Mailer and Dave Lombardo, former lead drummer for the band Slayer.</td>

 Cantor took samples of existing film material from pornographic and popular films. In Be my Baby she mixes images from, for example, The Sound of Music and the horror classic The Texas Chainshaw Massacre with brief scenes from porno films. Cantor adapts these fragments from feature films, creating her own narrative style with which to examine such universal themes as love, beauty and hope. 'My perversion is the belief in true love' reads the title of her recently published book in which she describes her work; it will be on sale in the Museum during the film festival. -- These two American artists are each related -- in a particular way -- to the world of Hollywood.</td>
