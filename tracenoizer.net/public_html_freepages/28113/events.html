<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" Risemberg, who is gay, planned his first event for men who wanted to meet other men "as a self-interested experiment," he told the Forward. "Fifty people signed up, and we were turning away more at the door. Risemberg has presided over more than 165 events and has expanded Date Bait to include sessions for heterosexual men and women, Jews and singles of various backgrounds and ages. Last month, a group of 141 single men and women, mostly Jewish, gathered at the 92nd Street Y in New York City to get down to business. Seated in a circle, participants passed around a microphone, taking 30 seconds each to introduce themselves.">

 Next, there is a half-hour mingling period, during which participants chat with the people they were eyeing during the intros. At the end, people enter into a computer the names of those whom they'd like to date, and the computer spits out the matches. "I've noticed that the people attending the events are a little more serious in their pursuit of someone; people are saying a little more in their minute," said Mr. Risemberg, who noted that before September 11 many participants took only about 20 seconds to say their piece.
