Risemberg, now a 41-year-old education professor at Kean College in New Jersey, started Date Bait in October 1996 as a scheme for rustling up some dates for himself. Risemberg, who is gay, planned his first event for men who wanted to meet other men "as a self-interested experiment," he told the Forward. "Fifty people signed up, and we were turning away more at the door. Risemberg has presided over more than 165 events and has expanded Date Bait to include sessions for heterosexual men and women, Jews and singles of various backgrounds and ages.">

 As young Jews try to piece their lives back together, many are dating more seriously and more frequently than before. Risemberg founded five years ago, had its best-attended Jewish singles night ever, he said. While last month's event drew 80 lonely hearts to the 92nd Street Y, a comprable event last year drew only 51, Mr. Date Bait, originally formed as a gay singles event, is a mixer divided into three parts. In the first part, everyone in the room spend a minute introducing themselves to the group.</td>
