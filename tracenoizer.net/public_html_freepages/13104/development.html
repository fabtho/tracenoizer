 If lithologic cyclicity is established and correlated to established astronomically tuned isotope curves, the facies architecture of the cycle can be tied to sea level changes. . PROBLEM DEVELOPMENT PROBLEM DEVELOPMENT As best illustrated through borehole logging and seismic data, the facies architecture is not monolithic but probably cyclic within the upper slope of the Great Australian Bight, based on data presented in Holbourn et al. However, cyclicity cannot be proven without better chronostratigraphic control. Based upon much work done by many investigators (e.</td>
