 We continue to build on and advance our successful TrackPoint and ScrollPoint mouse products. Today, computer desktops, GUI's, and web browsers serve as our primary interfaces to the world of information. To go beyond this, our research aims at creating intelligent agents that can act as intermediaries, assisting people in their interactions with abundant information. Intermediaries may also be able to handle many of the more mundane interactions between people. Promoting satisfying and effective social interactions that are mediated by technology is a rapidly growing challenge.</td>
