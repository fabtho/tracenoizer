 This will provide us with a history of multi-user systems, as well as some insight into useful approaches for incorporation into the GreenSpace system. Before delving into the systems themselves, we will briefly examine common network communication protocols and the types of network communication models used for virtual environments. 1 Common Network Protocols For the various users in a distributed multi-user application to share the same virtual space and interact, their host machines must communicate with each other via a network. TCP guarantees reliable delivery of messages sent, while UDP makes no guarantees; TCP is much slower, and therefore less suitable for real-time communication, than UDP. The server simply maintains the database, while the clients handle computation and rendering.</td>
