 A 128 bit random session key is generated and pgp is invoked to encrypt it with the public keys of the named users. The encrypted session key is transmitted to subsequently named hosts and then used to IDEA encrypt sound sent to them. This avoids the separate step of generating and exchanging a session key described above for the -e option. Since the actual public key encryption is performed by pgp, as long as you're entitled to use that program, you can enjoy the convenience of public key exchange of session keys for audio as well. The device will be busy for input whenever sfmike is running.</td>
