 This is good for me because it's not always clear which chip revision had flow control added. Surprisingly, flow control has had a major impact on driver Rx structure. Most designs automatically trigger flow control when the chip is about to run out of Rx buffers. My drivers used to be structured to never run out of Rx buffers to avoid this case -- they recycled Rx buffers rather than passing them to the software queue layer when they were running short. So I changed the drivers to run out of Rx buffers(.</td>

 I was determined to do all six of the choreographed movement groups in one flowing set. ) Spinning back kick, roundhouse, step side kick, bow to the judges. I preach that stuff in my leadership seminars, and lest I run the risk of being little more than a dried up well-spring of empty bumper-sticker phrases, I felt the need to practice what I preach. My buddy Pete taught me to kick more from the front. My buddy, John, and his awesome spinning back kicks.</td>
