 Simple streaming is where flow control can fall down. . Some updated chips that have added flow control and have on-chip transceivers look at the negotiation results and turn on flow control without driver intervention. This is good for me because it's not always clear which chip revision had flow control added. Surprisingly, flow control has had a major impact on driver Rx structure.</td>

 Within the plant we had many castles and we had to go through and break down those walls. What we were also finding is that cells were highly efficient in their particular function but when you needed to move employees out of their cell they weren't very efficient. assembly line manager and coauthor of Creating Continuous Flow (2001, Lean Enterprise Institute). "What I see are machines that were moved together in a tight U. They have a person at every machine and inventory at every machine.</td>
