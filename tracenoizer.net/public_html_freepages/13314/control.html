 Simple streaming is where flow control can fall down. . Some updated chips that have added flow control and have on-chip transceivers look at the negotiation results and turn on flow control without driver intervention. This is good for me because it's not always clear which chip revision had flow control added. Surprisingly, flow control has had a major impact on driver Rx structure.</td>
