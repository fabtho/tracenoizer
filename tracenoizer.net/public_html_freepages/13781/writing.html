<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" His novel The Hill of Dreams is perhaps the finest exploration ever written of the theme of the accursed artist. His 1914 short story The Bowmen gave rise to the World War One legend of The Angels of Mons. His writing powerfully evokes both the wildness of his native Wales, and the phantasmagorical sublimity of late Victorian London. In his essays and journalism he was a ceaseless propagandist against economic and scientific materialism Machen's work, both fiction and non-fiction, enjoyed high prestige both in Britain and America in the early part of this century, but the rise of modernist taste in fiction led to something of an eclipse of his reputation.
