<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" . Self-assembly is a term that describes the spontaneous formation of ordered structures, usually on mesoscopic scales, as a result of competing interactions that are usually present in complex fluids. The complex hierarchical organization in biological systems is largely due to self-assembly. Therefore, a fundamental understanding of self-assembly holds the key to understanding the myriad of wonderful forms that we find in Nature. Equally important, the principles of self-assembly can be profitably exploited in the design and synthesis of new materials.">

 Richard Helm recently rejoined IBM to start the Australian branch of the Object Technology Practice. Prior to that, he was a technology consultant with DMR Group, an international information technology consulting firm. There he actively applied design patterns to the design of commercial systems. Prior to DMR, Richard was in the Software Technology department at IBM T. Watson Research Center investigating object-oriented design and reuse and visualization.</td>
