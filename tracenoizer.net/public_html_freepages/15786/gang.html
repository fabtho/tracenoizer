 . This site started on a University server in 1995 and has been using its own domain name since 1998. The initial purpose of this web site was to share some of my research that acquired in the field when working on my gang territory map. Some of the results of my reseach were published in Territoriality Among African American Street Gang in Los Angeles.

One way to earn cash is to join a gang involved in the drug trade. Gang members often come from homes where they feel alienated or neglected They may turn to gangs when their needs for love are not being met at home. Risks increase when the community fails to provide sufficient youth programs or alternatives to violence.</td>
