 Current Workplans Open Archival Information System (OAIS) Reference Model Standard Reference Materials CCSDS 650. . US Efforts Towards ISO Archiving Standards - Overview US Efforts Towards ISO Archiving Standards - Overview ISO has encouraged the development of standards in support of the long term preservation of digital information obtained from observations of the terrestrial and space environments. ISO has requested that the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems Panel 2 coordinate the development of those standards. The initial effort has been the development of a Reference Model for an Open Archival Information System (OAIS).</td>
