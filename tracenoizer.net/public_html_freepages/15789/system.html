 A day without email would be a disaster, an Internet outage like cutting off blood flow. We work closely with CHEN PR to keep their systems healthy and to anticipate problems before they occur. This included implementing a file system architecture and robust backup plan for a network where most of the client machines are laptops that are often on the road. We implemented a remote access solution so that when people are on the road, they can still be connected as if they were in the office. We installed a Web electronic mail interface, for fast kiosk access when laptops are not convenient.</td>
