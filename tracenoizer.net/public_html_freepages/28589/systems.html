 We have built a special client Extranet where our clients can easily track the status, see the drafts or make comments and suggestions. It is a very useful tool in addition to the traditional ways of communication via e-mail and phone. Close and launch After the project is finished and all the web systems are thoroughly tested, we prepare the final development report, and then deliver and install the web site. The project is considered completed and ready for public launch after we provide all the deliverables contracted, and the client fully accepts our work. Support and maintenance After the web site is launched, you get support services from our team.</td>
