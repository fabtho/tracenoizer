 For example, object request brokers offer the potential to develop software called user interaction objects that perform specific, high-level tasks within the context of the customer's products or processes. A user interaction object developed for an automotive company might work with I-DEAS to help engineers reduce engine noise while they balance the trade-off against other performance-related objectives. Other potential uses of the Internet, Java, and OOP include "implementing a generic product structure in a controlled way through a PDM system to support mass customization,"Klosterman said. Moreover, such technologies could simplify the customization of PDM systems so that they advise engineers "which supporting components and information will be needed if they select a particular engine and transmission combination in automotive design,"he said. (Further information on I-DEAS Master Series and Metaphase is available at www.</td>

 Abdelal made a motion to create the two departments from the current one. Henry commented on the increase in headcount and student credit hours form fall semester to spring semester in contrast to the usual drop from fall semester to spring semester. Scott noted signs that faculty were being more realistic in expectations of students under the semester system. Martinez indicated students were perceiving this change. Scott added that students had gotten the message concerning the number credit hours needed per semester to graduate and in many cases would make up hours in the summer.</td>
