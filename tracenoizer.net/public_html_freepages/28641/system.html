 After many mergers and acquisitions, the Dairy Farmers group faced massive information management challenges. Years of mergers had left them with disparate regional systems controlling and reporting on milk volume and quality. Deregulation on 1st July 2000 saw the introduction of a nationalised payment system for the Group's farmers based on quotas and percentages, with slight variances over four different regions within the Group. MadcapV software from CGI provided the solution, comprehensive in its capacities and labour efficient in its application. The System The application manages and reports on milk flow, component and quality on a daily basis.</td>
