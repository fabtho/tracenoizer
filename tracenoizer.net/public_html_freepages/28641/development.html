 Pennsylvania first received a federal CASSP grant in 1985 and began building a state and local infrastructure for a comprehensive system of care. That infrastructure developed into a children's bureau in the state Department of Public Welfare's Office of Mental Health, children's mental health specialists in each of the state's four regions, CASSP coordinators in each county or joinder, and a statewide CASSP Advisory Committee. Since the 1997 reorganization of the Office of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services, children's services are administered from the Bureaus of Consumer and Family Affairs and Policy and Program Development. Additional grants enabled the development of CASSP systems of care at the local level and the creation of the Pennsylvania CASSP Training and Technical Assistance Institute. Almost 60,000 children and adolescents with severe emotional disorders in Pennsylvania are served each year in county mental health programs.</td>
