 For example, one student who is unable to move his hands uses a mouth wand (a stick attached to a mouthguard) to tap the keys. Special software lets him type sequences that require holding down more than one key at a time. Another student who is unable to control either his hands or his head uses a sip-and-puff device to communicate with the computer in Morse code, blowing air out through a plastic straw for a dot and sipping air in for a dash. The device translates the Morse code into characters the computer can understand. Students using mouthwands and sip-and-puff devices can type 30 words a minute.</td>
