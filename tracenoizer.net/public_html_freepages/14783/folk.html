 Ownership, copyright and title of this folk music CD review belongs to me, Kevin McCarthy. .com With his pleasing, inviting voice and grassroots folk song style, Joe McKay is reminiscent of your musical Uncle Fred providing a good time at family functions with his singing and playing. McKay doesn't bowl over listeners with breathtaking metaphor or puzzling obliqueness--his songwriting style is fairly straightforward. However, he possesses a knack for keenly and sincerely bringing to life people, places and times from throughout his life.</td>
