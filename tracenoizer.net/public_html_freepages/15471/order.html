 Although I'm not typically a fan of platform jumpers, this title features enough variety and comedy to make it an enjoyable diversion. Disney Interactive has done a fantastic job integrating one of their most beloved characters into a cute, arcade-style game for the whole family. My children latched on to this game right away (I had to wrestle it away from them or play late at night in order to review it). Although many of the difficult jumps are far too challenging for my 4 year old, he still enjoyed watching his sister play and attempting some of the easier areas. The biggest challenge is figuring out what you need to do in order to beat the boss.</td>
