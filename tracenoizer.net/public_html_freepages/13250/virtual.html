 ) This project is conducted under the international cooperation with Academy of Media Arts, Cologne, and Ministry of Research and Higher Education of North Rheine Westfalia, Germany. This program is enacted through the cooperation of corporations and organizations as a trial of new cultural activity, and is planned to promote media art as a leading movement in our future multi-media society. Christian Moeller, born in 1959, is a leading European artist who creates interactive virtual architecture and virtual cities. The works of Moeller, which make use of electronic media, are based on the idea that people entering into the virtual world without wearing special gadgets or equipment, can change the whole environment by their reactions to the creation or discovery of new space. To introduce Christian Moeller, Canon ARTLAB will hold ARTLAB - Prospect 2 "Virtual Cage" exhibition in cooperation with "P3 art and environment.</td>

 With the partners of Westbank Industries and Tactile Technology Knowbotic Research has founded mem_brane, a laboratory for media strategies. . These models are complex dynamic fields, which produce an exchange between virtual agents, poetic machines and interactive visitors. Knowbotic Research outlines technoid events parallel in real and virtual spaces to investigate the experience of the multiple layers of reality. The organization is based in Cologne at the Academy for Media Arts.</td>
