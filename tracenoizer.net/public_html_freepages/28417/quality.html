 Joint Archive for Sea Level Joint Archive for Sea Level The Joint Archive for Sea Level (JASL) is a collaborative arrangement between the National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC), the World Data Center-A (WDC-A) for Oceanography, and the University of Hawaii Sea Level Center (UHSLC). Beginning in the Fall of 2000, the JASL is supported by the new NOAA National Coastal Data Development Center (NCDDC). The JASL is responsible for the collaborative archive referred to as the Research Quality Data Set. The NODC would like to know about your intended use if you plan to download data. .</td>

 Please note that if you go to any of the Funding Council's Web pages, you will leave the British Council's Education Information Service. To return to the service you will need to use the 'Back' button on your Web browser. The research assessments rate the quality of research carried out in government funded higher education institutions. They determine how public funding is allocated selectively for research. The 1996 exercise is now complete, organised jointly by all of the Higher Education Funding Councils in the United Kingdom.</td>
