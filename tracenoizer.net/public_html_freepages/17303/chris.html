 Or just write to me if you can tell me anything about what camp is like. I've been to 5 camps,after a year off I'll be counsellor in Lingbo '96. In 1990 I've been in camp with Thea in Cavallera (Spain), while in 1992 I've been in camp with Chris in Heggnes (Norway). I'm really excited to start an internet corrispondence . Now I study in Milano at Bocconi University; I do not have an e-mail address but I hope you two will comunicate with me by this FANTASTIC BOOK.</td>

 Rachael Cureton played Sandra with single-minded determination, which was the perfect foil to Ben Sherriff's portrayal of the middle-class Tim, her boyfriend from the south who was intimidated by this monstrous scouse family. Kate Marsh played Sandra's mother Betty with great verve, bringing out the emptiness of a life spent outdoing her sister Reeny (played by Claire Wilson). Paul Culshaw was excellent as Reeny's disturbed son John, while Chris Pritchard played her car-obsessed husband Ted. The family was completed by the laid-back Vera (Steph Davenport), Tony Shannon as the drunken Tommy, and Michael Warren as Betty's hen-pecked husband, Syd. 's 'The Royle Family', but is infinitely superior to it because it dramatises Sandra's rejection of her family who are caught in a little claustrophobic world of materialism and futile dreams.</td>
