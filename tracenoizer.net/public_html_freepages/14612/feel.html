The true measure of romantic love is commitment and trust not physical attraction. It is possible to feel romantic love for more than one person at a given time.

 On night of September 10th, 2001, I played this song continuously for 8 hours. 1999, I had already written friends that a huge firebombing of Bush's cabinet would take place from a tall building in September. I can still feel if there is going to be an immediate plane crash by listening to the words of this song. Music with a driving beat can make you want to dance. .</td>

 During your separation and for a while after your divorce is final, you may experience frightening feelings of disorientation. Anxiety can be so generalized, you can't even put your finger on the exact cause. It feels like your brain is going to fly apart, and you might feel lost and confused most if not all of the time. Now you read the same opening paragraph 17 times, and still have no idea what it said. You feel crazy and stupid, and the worst part is that you think you may feel that way forever.</td>
