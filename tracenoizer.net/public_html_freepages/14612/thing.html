 Whoever pushes hard enough for their issue or makes the most noise is probably going to make a difference. It's nothing to do with the justice of the issues, the rightness or wrongness. I was thinking along these lines more and more as the Bosnian thing started up. Because they were people who were drawn into this because nobody else was going to do it. They'd been in Yugoslavia making a film, and people would say, 'Oh can you post these letters.</td>

 On the flip side, if you take one hundred Canadian dollars out of your bank account at an ATM, you've only set yourself back sixty-three dollars and change at home. Then you walk into the Gap, and everything's priced pretty much the same as at home, but in your head, you can lop a third off of that price. And then you start buying every goddamn thing you see. And it's a good thing, too, because Toronto is chock-full of awesome shoes and vintage dresses. ATMs in college towns do that, but not in New York.</td>
