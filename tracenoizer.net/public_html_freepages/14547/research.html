 Corporal Allman's superb technical knowledge and dedication in resolving this problem may have averted an in-flight emergency. . He used the aircraft Maintenance Record Set and the ADAM database for his initial research into the history of the problem. These records showed that the propeller had experienced several intermittent problems since October 1997. Knowing the history of previous snags and the efforts made to rectify them, he began to closely inspect other propeller components for serviceability.</td>

 Comparative EducationComparative Education especially considers the implications of comparative studies for the formation and implementation of policies-not only in education but in social, national and international development. Thus, it welcomes contributions from associated disciplines in the fields of government, management, sociology-and indeed technology and communications as these affect educational policy decisions. The Education ForumThe Education Forum has been formed to contribute to education policy through research and debate on the current issues, structures and expectations at all levels of New Zealand education. The International Bureau of Education (IBE) The International Bureau of Education is a UNESCO centre for the content of education. It investigates culture-specific dimensions of what the Western literature has conceptualized as "glass ceiling" impediments to women's career advancement in higher education.</td>
