For each habitat your goal will be to connect the bird sounds with their matching photos. There are roughly 10 birds available for each habitat so you will have to play the game multiple times to see and hear all the available birds.

 The first list, by Voice, is sorted alphabetically by the sounds birds make. The second, by Bird, is sorted alphabetically by bird name. One can hear many more birds than one can see on most field trips. It's great fun and as much a rewarding challenge to identify birds by their sounds as by their appearance and behavior. I discovered this some years ago at the prompting of a friend, as she pointed out the White-throated Sparrow that we could hear but could not see.</td>

 You work for an hour writing a complicated VBA macro, a difficult Javascript-heavy web page, or a complex mail merge document. At the end of your presentation, thank the class for coming. Secretly press ALT-A to hear an auditorium full of applause, while you modestly play down the show of appreciation. Easily play the sounds by just pressing a keystroke with the FingerPrince program in Training Tools. .</td>
