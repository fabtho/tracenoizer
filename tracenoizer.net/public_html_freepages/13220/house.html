 -China relations improve January 27, 2000 Taiwanese vice president backs his mentor's China policyJanuary 27, 2000 U. . tries to ease strained ties RELATED STORIES, SITES From staff and wire reports WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The White House says President Bill Clinton will veto a congressional bill that would expand military ties between the United States and Taiwan. "It would upset the very delicate and the central balance that has existed for 25 years across the Taiwan Straits," National Security Adviser Samuel Berger said Wednesday. The Taiwan Security Enhancement Act comes at a time when the United States is trying to shore up support for permanent trade relations with China, which still considers Taiwan a province -- and the White House fears the bill could get in the way of that goal.</td>

When the crisis originally came up, Governor Gray Davis sought help from the White House for relief from extremely high-energy prices.

No one takes the Fifth Amendment unless they have something to hide.</td>
