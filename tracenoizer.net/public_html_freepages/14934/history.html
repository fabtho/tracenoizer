<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" In The Wilding of America (1996), the most recent of his seven previous books, he compares the teenagers who savagely attacked a Central Park jogger in 1989 to turn-of-the-century robber barons and to those who operate modern-day sweatshops. In Wilding he also anticipated his current attack on corporate America and its abuse of power, calling for a more virtuous capitalism. Kennedy's "Profiles in Courage" is not only a timeless inspiration to all Americans who devote their lives to public service--it is a fast moving, well written, concise history that offers brief yet compelling glimpses of courage under fire in the United States Senate. Each man gets at most a chapter, and so Kennedy limited himself to one or two important events in their political careers, often their last stand. Not only are these men admirable but they are also very real.">
