Expecting to find musicians, instruments, and a score among a composer's ideas, players slide the silver disk into the computer to find the world has turned upside-down. The music is not played on instruments but on Masaki Fujihata's specially designed score that changes as the game progresses.

 . It is performed on the Audiovisual Environment Suite, a set of five interactive systems which allow people to create and perform abstract animation and synthetic sound, simultaneously, in real time. Small Fish Tale is a performance developed by Masaki Fujihata, Kiyoshi Furukawa, and Wolfgang Munch for software originally developed at the ZKM in Karlsruhe. The Small Fish software is primarily an interactive music-producing picture, whose score is changed through the manipulation of graphical objects. The DVD recording features multi-angle video options, as well as Dolby 5.</td>
