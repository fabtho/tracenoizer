 The only general trend that I can observe is that in Japan, scientists appear to emphasize "quality of life" topics somewhat more than their counterparts in the West, i. This can be seen from the abstracts that are attached below. I should also note that about half of the speakers presented video tapes showing their work. Readers who are interested in the topics should contact the authors and specifically ask about the availability of tapes (even noting that these may not be of professional quality), as this is an excellent way to understand the project. The General Chair of NR'94, and a good contact for queries, is the following.</td>

 Small Fish Tale is a performance developed by Masaki Fujihata, Kiyoshi Furukawa, and Wolfgang Munch for software originally developed at the ZKM in Karlsruhe. The Small Fish software is primarily an interactive music-producing picture, whose score is changed through the manipulation of graphical objects. The DVD recording features multi-angle video options, as well as Dolby 5. Additionally, the disc is also a CD-ROM, and contains the different software systems used in the two performances. (This CD-ROM component is only compatible with Windows 98, NT4, and 2000 for the PC, and requires a DVD-ROM drive).</td>
