 In Finland our products are very well-known, as well as those of our powerful co-operating Tetra partners. Vehicle antenna systems The Cojot antenna development work has traditionally been mainly focused on vehicle systems. For instance, if you need a small but efficient vehicle antenna for Tetra, the right solution is Cojot's inconspicuous As Tetra Mini system. Besides Tetra the system allows use of cellular phone.
