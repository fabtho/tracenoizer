 Background in cryogenic refrigeration Years ago I ran a 2 year duration NSF funded project to develop a cryogenic refrigerator. Immediately following that I worked for the world's largest industrial gas industry in the cryogenics engineering group. I gained a lot of experience and also for instance designed and helped build a neon liquefier which was used commercially for 5 years. I didn't do this yesterday but it is part of my background. Background in thermodynamics Every physicist understands basic thermodynamics, usually calling it statistical physics.</td>

 . They went to Jimmy Schmidt, an innovative award-winning chef whose Rattlesnake Club, hard by the river in Detroit, has enlivened the culinary possibilities of that city for 12 years. He has, for instance, designed food regimens for the special requirements of ocean racers. Thus, besides having before the team delectable foods handsomely presented, GM wanted the dining experience to be reassuring and stress reducing as well. And having a choice - a sense of control - is another stress reducer.</td>

 In the first year, the school tried a computer lab, but teachers objected to it because it separated students from them. Over time, Apple placed approximately 30 computers into each cluster classroom of 64 students. Most of the computers are recessed into specially designed tables that can be used for other student work when the computer is not needed. The Progressive School had a history of getting district waivers for its curriculum and methodology. Rather than continue to get waivers on a piecemeal basis, the school chose to apply to become one of the state's first charter schools and received this designation in March 1993.</td>
