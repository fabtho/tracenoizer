 . Once you asked translators to change to using ssh to access CVS. I have a difficult network situation (behind a firewall) and i am making some tricks to get access to the repository, so needed some time to check if I would be able to use CVS after changing the method. Now that I've done some doc reading and experiments it seems that it will be OK, but there's this password problem. Namely, I don't remember the password, I only have in .</td>

 If the Max-Forwards field-value is an integer greater than zero, the proxy MUST decrement the field-value when it forwards the request. If no Max-Forwards field is present in the request, then the forwarded request MUST NOT include a Max-Forwards field. 3 GET The GET method means retrieve whatever information (in the form of an entity) is identified by the Request-URI. If the Request-URI refers to a data-producing process, it is the produced data which shall be returned as the entity in the response and not the source text of the process, unless that text happens to be the output of the process. A conditional GET method requests that the entity be transferred only under the circumstances described by the conditional header field(s).</td>

 BBBB Pg_IMAGE_DIRECT_565 This format packs each pixel into 2 bytes and matches the display format of most 16-bit, direct-color, graphics drivers. BBBB Pg_IMAGE_DIRECT_444 This format requires 2 bytes per pixel. It matches the high-speed color lookup tables used by palette-based graphics drivers and provides the fastest method of drawing direct-color images with palette-based graphics drivers. BBBB Pg_IMAGE_GRADIENT_BYTE This format uses 1 byte per pixel. The colors are algorithmically generated as a gradient between the color set by PgSetFillColor() and the color set by PgSetTextColor().</td>
