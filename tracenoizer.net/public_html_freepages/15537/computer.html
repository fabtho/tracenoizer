<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" A quick glance at his resume might lead one to the conclusion that Ivan Sutherland can't keep a job. In fact, his longest continuous job is his current position at Sun Microsystems where he divides his time between Sun's corporate activities, and exploring his current interest in advanced hardware technology -- Asynchronous Systems. Keep reading his long list of accomplishments in the field of computer information systems, and you will undoubtedly agree with the Smithsonian Computerworld committee who recently awarded him the Price Waterhouse Information Technology Leadership Award for Lifetime Achievement. Not inclined to dwell on the past, Ivan seems eager to get on with the future. Once he has cracked a new problem -- opened a new door -- he moves on to the next one, leaving it to others to develop the applications of his pioneering work.">

 . Institute of Technology In the early sixties, few computers ran "on line. " Instead, most computers ran "batches" of jobs submitted by users to the computer operators who scheduled the jobs to keep the computer fully occupied. Turn around time for each job was usually an hour or more, and often overnight. One notable exception was the TX-2 computer at MIT's Lincoln Laboratory.</td>

 Researchers at both facilities had grappled for some time with developing better channels of communication between computers and humans. Although not scheduled to give a formal presentation, he asked a question at the end of a session that made the meeting organizers realize he might have something important to add to the gathering. He was asked to speak to the group the next day, where he presented a series of slides he had brought along of his research project that illustrated not only a new way of handling computer graphics, but a powerful new way of operating computers as well. Although we take these abilities very much for granted today, Sketchpad was the first program that allowed the creation of graphic images directly on a display screen rather than by entering codes and formulas into the computer through a keyboard. Even more revolutionary, it allowed for the information that was stored in the computer to be altered and updated by changing something on the display screen.</td>
