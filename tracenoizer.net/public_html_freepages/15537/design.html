<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" " "A Worthy Intellectual Opponent" Over the years, Sutherland has prevailed over a number of new problems, each one advancing computer science. After 30 years, the excitement of attacking a problem on the frontier of technology is still evident in Ivan's voice when discussing his latest exploration. From computer graphics, to the head-mounted display that anticipated today's virtual reality systems, from robotics and integrated circuit design to his current Asynchronous System ideas, Ivan relishes an "intellectual opponent" worthy of engaging -- a mental sparring partner. Ivan's first experience with a computer was with SIMON, a relay-based mechanical computer that was lent to the Sutherland household by Edmund Berkeley. Ivan reports his first big computer program was to make SIMON divide.">

 September 1999 32 LEW-16710 Program for Designing a Mechanical System This program offers advantages of ease of use, accuracy, efficiency, and speed April 1999 49 LEW-16622 Software for Minimizing and Removing Burrs in Manufacturing The overall costs of manufacturing precise components would be reduced. March 1999 34 LEW-16583 Improvememnts in Generating and Using Unstructured CFD Grids A grid-generation code accepts data from CAD software. December 1998 44 LEW-16601 Designing With help of Neural-Network and Parallel Computing Large design problems can be solved faster and more efficiently than before. December 1998 52 LEW-16582 Software for Analysis and Design of Turbomachinery These programs can be used to design seals to imporve overall machine performance. March 1997 30 LEW-16323 Computing Off-Design Performances of Axial-Flow Turbines A revised code incorporates improved mathimatical models of flows and losses.</td>

 Mc - Cryogenics; refrigerators, low-temperature equipment . . AP 13, 225-228 Design and performances of a shielded liquid helium insert with an optically heated variable temperature stage for the study of low frequency magnetic noise in HT superconductors X. The insert has a variable temperature stage made of sapphire which is optically heated by the light guided from an external lamp via a glass rod. Furthermore, the magnetic attenuation factor due to the superconducting lead can is greater than 26 500 for frequencies above 15 Hz.</td>

 In this fast-paced economy, developing the best solution for storing, protecting and accessing vital corporate information can mean the difference between being a market leader or disastrous loss of business. 6 billion global supplier of integrated circuits for the personal and networked computer and communications markets, is the world's second largest supplier of Microsoft Windows-compatible PC processors. AMD's Microprocessor Design Division (MPD) designs its AMD Athlon processors in Austin, Texas, and Sunnyvale, Calif. The design and simulation of integrated circuits is both compute and storage intensive. The MPD Systems Engineering group has chosen to implement an appliance approach for its IT infrastructure, using dedicated computer systems designed specifically for the task at hand.</td>
