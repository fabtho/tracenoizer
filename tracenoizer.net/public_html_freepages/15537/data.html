 AMD's approach has resulted in a highly effective Network Attached Storage (NAS) infrastructure to store and protect the high volume of valuable information for the company's AMD Athlon microprocessor division. Ease of system management was a key factor for AMD in choosing to consolidate all storage applications on NetApp filers. The filers' simplicity and ease of management enables AMD to manage more than 15 TB of data and support the entire AMD Athlon processor design team with a small IT staff. Consolidating vital data on a network of high-capacity filers instead of distributing data on a larger network of heterogeneous, general-purpose servers also simplifies the complex task of data backup and recovery. AMD chose the Quick Restore backup and recovery system from Workstation Solutions to protect their data and ensure that all 15 TB is recoverable in case of disaster.</td>
