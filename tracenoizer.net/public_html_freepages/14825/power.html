 APS wants to be certain that our communities have reliable electricity that can accommodate this rapid growth. Therefore, we are planning facilities to respond to the immediate and future needs in this booming area. The West Valley-South Power Line and Substation Project is the APS upgrade and expansion project needed to help bring more power to the West Valley so we can meet the increasing demand for electricity. This project will include three 230 kilovolt (kV) substation and twelve 69kV substations, as well as associated power lines. .</td>

 Custom machining of stock Keihin CV carburetor optimizes fill-times and improves mixture velocity. We bore the throat of the CV to achieve the highest C. We modify the idle, midrange, and full power circuits to maximize the performance at all throttle settings. Finally, we use top-of-the-line Creative Cycle Products adjustable idle mixture screws and brass fuel inlets. The greatest improvement per dollar can be found within the carburetor and air cleaner assembly.</td>
