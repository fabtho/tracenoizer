 . If you take your games seriously and want to experience the feel as well as the sights and sound of the environment, you should think about something costing a lot more. This two-part flight controller, aimed primarily at flight simulator enthusiasts but usable in other game-types, too, consists of a joystick sculpted to fit the right hand and a throttle moulded to the left. Both units bristle with buttons - slide switches, rotary controls and top-hats - so you have a total of 18 different controls, most of which are programmable. The throttle action - pull forward and back - is smooth and positive and there's a screw underneath which changes the friction of it.</td>

 Connectivity is provided by a single USB cable about three feet long. Beneath the base are four suction cups to keep the joystick from moving. Unfortunately, the throttle on the F-108 is placed inconveniently; using it with a second hand when its cramped so close to the stick is uncomfortable after periods of time; furthermore, it makes it difficult to switch between the keyboard and the throttle wheel. Placing the throttle wheel on the column itself so it could be operated by the right hand would have left the left hand free for keyboard or mouse manipulation. The throttle has too much tension for its size; altering it is unnaturally tedious.</td>

 Custom machining of stock Keihin CV carburetor optimizes fill-times and improves mixture velocity. We bore the throat of the CV to achieve the highest C. We modify the idle, midrange, and full power circuits to maximize the performance at all throttle settings. Finally, we use top-of-the-line Creative Cycle Products adjustable idle mixture screws and brass fuel inlets. The greatest improvement per dollar can be found within the carburetor and air cleaner assembly.</td>
