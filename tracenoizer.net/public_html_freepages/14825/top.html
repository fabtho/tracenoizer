<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" If you take your games seriously and want to experience the feel as well as the sights and sound of the environment, you should think about something costing a lot more. This two-part flight controller, aimed primarily at flight simulator enthusiasts but usable in other game-types, too, consists of a joystick sculpted to fit the right hand and a throttle moulded to the left. Both units bristle with buttons - slide switches, rotary controls and top-hats - so you have a total of 18 different controls, most of which are programmable. The throttle action - pull forward and back - is smooth and positive and there's a screw underneath which changes the friction of it. The joystick also has a smooth feel and is properly gusseted underneath against dirt and dust.">

 We bore the throat of the CV to achieve the highest C. We modify the idle, midrange, and full power circuits to maximize the performance at all throttle settings. Finally, we use top-of-the-line Creative Cycle Products adjustable idle mixture screws and brass fuel inlets. The greatest improvement per dollar can be found within the carburetor and air cleaner assembly. Maintaining velocity is critical when cylinder fill times are in the 100th of a second.</td>
