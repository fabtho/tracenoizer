However, if someone wants to hunt legally and ethically, knowledge of how to make a quick kill can reduce the suffering of the prey. Spears used for fishing are generally most effective when propelled by some kind of force underwater. Hawaiian slings, and propelled spears can be used effectively with a lot of practice but most novice fish hunters should consider using a gun.
