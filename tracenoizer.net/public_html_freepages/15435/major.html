 It is simply a new take on what companies have always had to do if they wanted to survive -- put themselves through radical change. What's New Welcome to the new, and ever improving, Reengineering Resource Center. This directory is the most comprehensive listing of texts available to assist with organizational redesign and major change initiatives. A sequel to the 1993 best-seller, with a particular focus on management approaches, leadership, and human resources. Note, these are the new and correct dates for the Reengineering course.</td>

 This sequence contains 237 amino acids, with a relative molecular mass (Mr) of 26,079 for the peptide moiety of the molecule. Although a precise carbohydrate analysis has never been performed, Van Halbeek et al. The generation of gaseous ions from large proteins by soft ionization methods has played a major role in analytical application of mass spectrometry. The production of multiply charged ions by ISMS has been demonstrated for proteins as large as 150,000 to 200,000 Da and has achieved a high mass measurement precision for several proteins. To assign a precise molecular mass to PSA, the present study reports analysis of this protein by ISMS as well as analysis of its carbohydrate moiety by NMR spectrometry.</td>
