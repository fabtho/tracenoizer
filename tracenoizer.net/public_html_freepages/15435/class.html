 Based on these model representation paradigms, methods and frameworks for model integration have also been proposed. Although its primary purpose is to define and represent decision models, the paradigm has very high generality and shares basic features with object-oriented modeling in software engineering. This is precisely what the object-oriented concept of a class and the calss-composition graphs formalize. Structured modeling provides tools to define and represent the static aspect of a system of objects (the structure of objects and their relationships in a system). However, static aspect is just one of the aspects of a complete description of a system.</td>
