 Detail illustration on those three levels of integration are given. Further, a framework on methodology and infrastructure needs for supporting the midcro-integration is described. How to redesign business process is a topic for realization of CIMS total integration and also the essential part of Business Processes Reengineering(BPR). Considered the requirement of CIMS total integration and based on the principle of BPR, this paper presents the formulation of business process. Then it analyses the concept and content of business process redesign and presents the concept framework of and the general approach to business processes simplification and integration as guide for the study methodology of business process redesign in CIMS enterprise.</td>
