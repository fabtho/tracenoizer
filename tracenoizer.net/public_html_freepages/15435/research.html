 In the first area we are evaluating the use of cathepsin D as a prognostic factor for node-negative breast cancer patients, and we are purifying and characterizing cathepsin D from normal and malignant human breast tissue to better understand why its activity is significantly increased in malignant tissue. In the second area, we are investigating developmental changes of rat sperm I-L-fucosidase during testicular and epididymal maturation, and we are purifying and characterizing I-L-fucosidase from rat epididymal sperm. Both of the research areas we are investigating have health-related significance. Lange, Thomas Tachovsky, Santo Longo, Sandra Tucker and Jack A.
