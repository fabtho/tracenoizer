 . Associate Professor Department of Biology Georgia State University P. edu Developmental Plasticity and Functional Anatomy of Mammalian Visual and Auditory Pathways My research is directed toward discovering mechanisms which ensure normal development of the brain, and which compensate for perinatal brain damage. In particular, we are interested in the role of sensory experience in directing the development of brain circuitry. Using the retinotectal system, we create a mismatch between the retina and the optic tectum at birth by removing part of the tectum.</td>

 1 million, will be built on the corner of Michigan and Lafayette, with completion targeted for 2003. The laboratory and teaching facility will house GVSU's School of Health Professions, the Kirkhof School of Nursing, and programs from the Life Sciences. Seidman School of Business Lands Federal Program's Michigan Base GVSU's Seidman School of Business has been named the new Michigan Small Business Development Centers headquarters by the U. The headquarters comes to GVSU from Wayne State University, which hosted the center for the past 17 years. This marks the first time a federal program has placed its state headquarters in west Michigan.</td>
