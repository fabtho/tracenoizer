 Although its primary purpose is to define and represent decision models, the paradigm has very high generality and shares basic features with object-oriented modeling in software engineering. This is precisely what the object-oriented concept of a class and the calss-composition graphs formalize. Structured modeling provides tools to define and represent the static aspect of a system of objects (the structure of objects and their relationships in a system). However, static aspect is just one of the aspects of a complete description of a system. Within the extended structured modeling paradigm, static model and dynamic model are together used to model a system.</td>

 A sequel to the 1993 best-seller, with a particular focus on management approaches, leadership, and human resources. .Huang Li hua is currently a professor and Director of Information Management Information System Department. It is simply a new take on what companies have always had to do if they wanted to survive -- put themselves through radical change.
