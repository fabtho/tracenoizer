 Students Apply GVSU Degrees in Native Land Meihua Zhu and Lihua Huang are residents of Shanghai, China, but both marked the Chinese New Year in a decidedly different setting this year -- in a large celebration of Chinese culture held in Grand Rapids. The Chinese New Year Celebration, co-sponsored by the Chinese Association of West Michigan and GVSU, was held February 3 at the Eberhard Center. Zhu and Huang, professors at the East China University of Science and Technology, made their first trip to the United States last summer to attend GVSU's School of Social Work. Their goal is to earn master's degrees in social work, then return home to begin a social work program at East China University. It will be the first such curriculum in the six surrounding provinces, they said.</td>
