 The 18 holes of Cotton Dike require strategy and accuracy and in return provide a tireless golfing experience with a variety of interesting challenges. Almost half of the 18 holes lies along the marsh and Jenkins Creek, a wonderful contrast of the natural beauty of the Lowcountry and the precision design of the Cotton Dike course. Morgan River is the second course built at Dataw Island and is a striking example of the great talent of Arthur Hills. Narrower than Cotton Dike, the Morgan River course is the more demanding of your accuracy but well rewards every disciplined shot. The beauty of the course is dramatic; breaks in the stands of massive oaks create frames for the water views of the Morgan River and the savannahs beyond.</td>

 There are still a number of WWF superstars that have yet to be drafted, so it looks like we'll just have to wait and see. It has been 10 years, to the day, of my first match. In Levitown, Long Island, at Island Trees Junior High School in front of about 350 fans, Chris Kanyon (actually called Chris Morgan for this match only) was having his first match. It has been an unbelievable and tremendously rewarding ride. Yeah, I have a pretty nice house with a great backyard, playfully called "Klub Kanyon" by some people.</td>
