 Even with his A in the wine class, Springer wouldn't have made it to the salutatorian's post without dropping the grades he received for high school classes he took in middle school. This is allowed at Spanish River only for calculation of valedictorian and salutatorian. Over the past few years, McKee watched as grades from high school courses taken in middle school brought down the averages of students from public middle schools. Students from private middle schools, like Shelling and Church, were not affected because their earlier grades don't count toward their averages. The state says all high school-level and college-level courses taken at public schools must be included in a high school transcript.</td>
