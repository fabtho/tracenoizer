 Dataw Island Marina, a full service marina, is just across the Morgan River from Judge Island and all you have to do is hop in your boat, gas up and get a bite to eat at the new Marina Restaurant. New County Zoning requires a minimum of 3 acres per house and no commercial is allowed on Judge Island. The new Lady's Island Coosa Elementary School as well as the Lady's Island Middle School, the new Beaufort High School (to open this year) , the Private Beaufort Academy and St Peters School are all less that 15 minutes. A well built dock with a covered pier head and two separate floats that give easy access to both sides of your yacht. This is a perfect location for a Sports Fisherman or a Pleasure Yacht.</td>

 Sports fans will recognize the many Rose, Orange, and Cotton Bowl trophies; there are even a few Heisman trophies. An outstanding athletic and educational history has kept the students of Notre Dame proud. A private Catholic school, it also holds services for other religions in the chapel. There are some disadvantages to wanting to go to Notre Dame. Extra-curricular activities and good grades will obviously improve your chance of being accepted.</td>

 This is allowed at Spanish River only for calculation of valedictorian and salutatorian. Over the past few years, McKee watched as grades from high school courses taken in middle school brought down the averages of students from public middle schools. Students from private middle schools, like Shelling and Church, were not affected because their earlier grades don't count toward their averages. The state says all high school-level and college-level courses taken at public schools must be included in a high school transcript. But it's up to each school to decide what criteria to use to select the valedictorian and salutatorian.</td>
