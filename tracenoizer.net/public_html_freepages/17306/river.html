<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" The 18 holes of Cotton Dike require strategy and accuracy and in return provide a tireless golfing experience with a variety of interesting challenges. Almost half of the 18 holes lies along the marsh and Jenkins Creek, a wonderful contrast of the natural beauty of the Lowcountry and the precision design of the Cotton Dike course. Morgan River is the second course built at Dataw Island and is a striking example of the great talent of Arthur Hills. Narrower than Cotton Dike, the Morgan River course is the more demanding of your accuracy but well rewards every disciplined shot. The beauty of the course is dramatic; breaks in the stands of massive oaks create frames for the water views of the Morgan River and the savannahs beyond.">

 One of the last large tracts on beautiful Coosaw Island. .com Lady's Island District is composed of several islands surrounded by the Beaufort River, Brickyard Creek, Coosaw River (Intracoastal Waterway) and on the east connecting the Coosaw River and Morgan River by Parrots Creek. Highway 802 (to the south including Hilton Head, Bluffton, and Interstate 95 to Georgia) dissects Lady's Island, and the road truly ends at Judge Island. The Coosaw River and the Morgan River meet to form the St Helena Sound and on to the Atlantic Ocean.</td>

 And the formula for top honors was set a year ago, allowing students who came from public middle schools to exclude the high school courses they took there from the calculation of their grade-point averages. "Our school, our teachers voted to have it this way," Springer said. " At academically competitive Spanish River, students begin plotting their trek to top honors before they enter high school, taking high school classes in middle school and college classes in high school. An A in a high-school level class equals four points; an A in a college-level class garners six. By earning As in college courses, Spanish River's top three students ended up with the highest averages in the school's history.</td>
