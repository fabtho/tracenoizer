 We should hunt down those who refuse to acknowledge the real facts in this deadly struggle to share public spaces. A pedestrian is fatally struck by a car every four days in Toronto. A dozen cyclists are run over and killed in Ontario every year. In Toronto, many cyclists are maimed annually by careless drivers opening doors and hitting them from behind. In some cases, the injured cyclist is charged instead of the driver.</td>

 Let us underline Supposedly, because nothing else has been said about charges. Ron has only good things to say about the police, ambulance and hospital staff that assisted him after the accident. Something not regularly heard in Mike Harris's Ontario. "I remember looking up and there was this woman there and she held me close and talked to me. " Ron would love to see her again, just to thank her for being human.</td>

 Back in the days when city cycling was a novelty, the orthodoxy from two-wheel advocates was that riders should obey all the rules to win engineless vehicles a place on the pavement. But what have 20 years of playing by the rules of the Highway Traffic Act gotten us. Not much, judging by the testimony last weekend at the annual Law Union of Ontario conference, held at OISE. The fact that the law treats cyclists the same as motor vehicles is a problem, participants declared, not a plus. More sinisterly, it requires cyclists to act in ways that endanger their safety.</td>

 I would appreciat any information And a little bit of History. Unfortunately, I do not and would appreciate any help in finding what it says. Did you know that every year on July 1 the Frisians in Ontario, Canada get together for a day of food, fun, games en songs. and enjoy a day of meeting fellow Frisians, playing the game of kaetsen and many other games. Thousands of people show up on this day because July 1 is also Canada day and most people have the day off from work.</td>
