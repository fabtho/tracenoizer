Petitions were then signed, addressed to all three levels of government, demanding better infrastructure, side guards on trucks and just some cash for cyclists. "The street is a death trap for cyclists and pedestrians," says Martin Reis, ARC member and the point man with local Councillor Joe Pantalone. Three members of ARC, Reis included, met with the Councillor, who's ward includes the corner of College and Grace. "The first thing he said was, no way he was even going to consider taking out parking spots to make it safer for cyclists," said Derek Chadbourne another ARC member present.">

 This means that all bike lanes, bike routes and bike path projects slated for this year can go ahead as planned. For the Urban Development Services budget cycling items did not fare as well. This money is now in the permanent budget thanks to a motion by Councillor Joe Pantalone (Trinity-Spadina Ward 19). This means it should not be an issue during next year's budget. The Bike Plan envisioned more activity in these areas of Safety and the restoration of the Road and Trail Safety Ambassadors program to its previous level.</td>
