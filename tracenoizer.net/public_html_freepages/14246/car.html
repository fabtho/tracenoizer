 There will be no car unturned in ARC's campaign to see that tragedies like Ron Freeman never happen again. .Business First, Safety Second The most terrifying sound an Urban Cyclist will hear is that of a car door opening. That split second when every sense in your body tries to discern if the sound is coming from directly in front of you. The heart stops beating as you anxiously look around for the incoming bullet.</td>

 11 have given eye readers an insightful view of your warped vision. Mighty you stand above "ignorant" and "arrogant" Westerners when you write us about the "enlightening" effect Islam has had on you. Of course, this comes from "first-hand" exposure to a man who cranks audio recordings of scriptures in his car and uses a compass to find goodness. Any idiot can tell you, Bruce, that goodness is universal and does not require one to learn a new tongue or point oneself to a certain geographical location. Your negative opinions should not be surprising to eye readers -- after all, that's what one expects of this publication.</td>

 Here's how can we make getting around a whole lot saner. All of a sudden, a siren sounded right behind my rear wheel and a police cruiser pulled up beside me. The passenger window lowered and I felt a rush of warm air wafting from the cozy squad car. Here were two motorists ensconced in heavy metal and glass, lecturing an all-season cyclist in a non-polluting, non-lethal form of transit about public safety. Back in the days when city cycling was a novelty, the orthodoxy from two-wheel advocates was that riders should obey all the rules to win engineless vehicles a place on the pavement.</td>
