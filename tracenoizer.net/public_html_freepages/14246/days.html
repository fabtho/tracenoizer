 HECTOR IBARRA CARS ARE THE REAL MENACE Re "Hunt down the cyclists" (Letters, Nov. We should hunt down those who refuse to acknowledge the real facts in this deadly struggle to share public spaces. A pedestrian is fatally struck by a car every four days in Toronto. A dozen cyclists are run over and killed in Ontario every year. In Toronto, many cyclists are maimed annually by careless drivers opening doors and hitting them from behind.</td>

 "It really sent a chill through the heart of the community. " ARC, Advocacy for Respect of Cyclists, stepped in and helped Ron on several fronts. They made sure his letter of intent to sue the city was in within the required seven days. There has been a successful demonstration several strategy meetings and one sit down with the local councillor. The demonstration rallied the cities cyclists to come out to the corner of College and Grace and go on strike.</td>

 The passenger window lowered and I felt a rush of warm air wafting from the cozy squad car. Here were two motorists ensconced in heavy metal and glass, lecturing an all-season cyclist in a non-polluting, non-lethal form of transit about public safety. Back in the days when city cycling was a novelty, the orthodoxy from two-wheel advocates was that riders should obey all the rules to win engineless vehicles a place on the pavement. But what have 20 years of playing by the rules of the Highway Traffic Act gotten us. Not much, judging by the testimony last weekend at the annual Law Union of Ontario conference, held at OISE.</td>
