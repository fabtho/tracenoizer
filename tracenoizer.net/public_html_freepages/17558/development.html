 Developers who want to ensure that their Java applications will interoperate with assistive technologies, such as screen readers, Braille terminals, etc. , use the Java Accessibility API in all of the user-interface components of their applications. Vendors are building alternate user interfaces for the Java Foundation Classes to provide interfaces in non-traditional modalities, including the current development of low-vision and audio user interfaces for the JFC. Vendors are also building Assistive Technologies in Java, such as the IBM Special Needs Systems group, which is building a screen reader for the Java platform that will provide blind access to Java applications which support the Java Accessibility API. The many developers who are building products on top of the Java Foundation Classes are already automatically transparently using Java Accessibility to make their applications accessible.</td>

 Since we cover a lot of areas of the linux kernel we have separate links to pages that have developments in each different sub system Input API Getting Involved So you like to try out this new system or even better yet contribute. If you'd like to give it a try click here for instructions. Once you try it out we know you will have questions or just want to tell your experiences we have a public development mailing list. Now if you like to get your hands dirty and get involved I recommend joining our CVS commit mailing list. Plus each page for subscribing has a link to the mailing list archives.</td>
