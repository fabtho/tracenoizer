 Since it is built into the Java Foundation Classes, which is core to the Java Platform and thus don't need to be ported from a different environment, developers will find that the Java Accessibility is very easy to use - virtually all of the work is done for them. The IBM Special Needs Systems group has been a close partner in the development of the Java Accessibility API, and they have developed a set of Guidelines for Writing Accessible Applications in the Java programming language. This document describes in detail how to use the Java Accessibility API and the Java Foundation Classes in order to develop mainstream applications that are fully accessible. The Java Accessibility Bridge, which provides a mechanism for existing native Assistive Technologies to communicate with programs on the Java platform using the Java Accessibility API, requires platform-specific code and when released may function differently on different platforms. The Java Accessibility Utilities package includes a lot of accessibility support for AWT, providing mechanisms for externally monitoring all AWT events, and for externally retrieving the AWT object at any given point on the screen.</td>
