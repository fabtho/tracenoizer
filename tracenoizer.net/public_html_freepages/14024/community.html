 Particularly now, we are asking ourselves what can we do. Maybe we have a sense of powerlessness because everything around us is moving fast and seems a bit out of control. We can make a difference-you can make our community stronger by getting involved, volunteering, or making a contribution. If you would like to tour any or all of our programs, please call Kristin Bolken at 206. For more information about YouthCare's programs, visit www.</td>

 The philosophy generally has been for government services and agencies to deal with kids in trouble with the law in much the same way as they do for other social trauma. In fact, under the Quebec system, regional youth protection officials are empowered to act as the persons responsible for young offenders. In this way kids in trouble with the law are dealt with from the point of view of the family and the community. A rehabilitation program with a young offender is in the form of a kind of contract involving the family and correctional officials. Measures may take the form of donations, community service, work for the victim (in crimes against property), coupled with counseling and clinical services to deal with social and behavioral problems.</td>
