 All three daughters worked on the household staff of Newtown Quaker School in Waterford as young adults. Anne Black married Edward Garnet, a superintendent of the school in 1866, and Mary Black married Walter Willmott, a teacher at the school (my great grandfather) in 1867. That is all I know about the Black family, and I would greatly appreciate any leads about how I could find additional information. ..</td>
