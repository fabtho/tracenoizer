 FSC Forest Certification is increasing recognition in Japan; the Yusuhara municipal government in Kouchi Prefecture obtained the second FSC Forest Certification in Japan with the local government of Mie Prefecture and private enterprises in line. . FSC Forest Certification entails two certification programs; Forest Management Certification, which certifies the quality of forest management and; Chain-of-Custody Certification (CoC), which verifies whether the forest product comes from certified forests. Forest Certification is a way of ensuring that consumer's purchases of forest products do not contribute to forest destruction or degradation by choosing "Well-Managed" labelled products. For the landowners, the Certification is a way of ensuring that their efforts in careful forest management are recognized in the marketplace.</td>
