FSC Forest Certification entails two certification programs; Forest Management Certification, which certifies the quality of forest management and; Chain-of-Custody Certification (CoC), which verifies whether the forest product comes from certified forests. Forest Certification is a way of ensuring that consumer's purchases of forest products do not contribute to forest destruction or degradation by choosing "Well-Managed" labelled products. For the landowners, the Certification is a way of ensuring that their efforts in careful forest management are recognized in the marketplace. A "Well-Managed Forest" certification is granted when an independent assessment of resource sustainability, ecosystem viability and socio-economic benefit verifies compliance with FSC's international standards for respnsibile forest management.</td>
