 FSC Forest Certification is increasing recognition in Japan; the Yusuhara municipal government in Kouchi Prefecture obtained the second FSC Forest Certification in Japan with the local government of Mie Prefecture and private enterprises in line. . FSC Forest Certification entails two certification programs; Forest Management Certification, which certifies the quality of forest management and; Chain-of-Custody Certification (CoC), which verifies whether the forest product comes from certified forests. Forest Certification is a way of ensuring that consumer's purchases of forest products do not contribute to forest destruction or degradation by choosing "Well-Managed" labelled products. For the landowners, the Certification is a way of ensuring that their efforts in careful forest management are recognized in the marketplace.</td>

 The club, revealing the suspension in a statement to investors, gave no reason for its failure to publish a profits statement for the year to 31 May. But the firm warned that the period had been dogged by pre-tax losses and spiralling borrowing costs, problems whcih had continued in recent months. Monday's statement also hinted that the suspension could last for some time, with trade in Nottingham Forest shares not set to resume until the results have been published. The club has since seen manager David Platt take over stewardship of England's Under-21 side, and are enjoying only a moderate season, and stand 13th in the First Division. Forest have attempted to lighten its debt burden by releasing midfielder Chris Bart-Williams.</td>
