 We've helped some clients by pulling the needle out of their information haystack. We've helped other clients by evaluating proposals that they've been given. If you're busy and you don't have the background it's often hard to judge - do you rely on the glibness of the vendor, the quality of his suit, the number of buzzwords per page. As with our research, while we understand the magic languages used by lawyers, technologists, marketers and public servants we communicate with you in the way that best meets your needs.

 As for protective measures, the ministries of economics and finance have drafted a government resolution to lift customs concessions on imports of newsprint and other forest products. Practically all customs concessions would be abolished in 1999, although preferences would still be awarded to foreigners investing in the start-up of a Russian forest product enterprise. The sector, in which enterprises are running at between 30 and 60 percent capacity, is thought capable of producing all kinds of paper except the highest quality chalk-coated paper. OVERHAULING THE INDUSTRY The Russian Ministry of Economics has come up with a proposal to turn the state-owned Roslesprom timber corporation into a holding company, Lesprom, to "strengthen management of the Russian timber complex. First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Masliukov has asked the ministries of economics and of state property to work on the RAO Lesprom project.</td>
