The implementation of a Web Service is abstract and hidden to the client and is the core of component-based web development. Web Services are usable when a client uses a standard way to represent data and commands, to represent Web Service contracts, and to be exposed to the capabilities that a Web Service provides. Clients of a Web Service can be implemented on any platform in any programming language, and the API to the Web Service interface is part of the Web Service self-definition.</td>
