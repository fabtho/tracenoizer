 Check out the Writing Center in the basement of Yerkes Dormitory. It's a totally free peer tutoring service, and it's open Sunday through Thursday evenings from 7-11. We'll go over your writing assignments at any stage, whether you're just getting started or whether you're putting on the final touches, but of course it's always best to see us early in the process and make follow up visits as needed. Take advantage of this great service to improve your writing skills. You can just walk in, or you can make an appointment by calling x6024 during regular hours.</td>

 Naming Files When two documents are uploaded to the Drop Box with the same original file name, the second file uploaded will overwrite the first, no matter what you call them in Blackboard. Therefore, different versions of the same document need to be saved with a different file name before they are uploaded onto Blackboard. If your instructor provided you with specific instructions for naming files, review those notes before completing the process. Adding Files The first step towards sending a file to your instructor is to add the file to your digital drop box. This does not automatically send the file to your instructor.</td>
