 Overall it has been very difficult to build applications that easily allow the distribution of data and messages between enterprises. The first was to recognize that the ability of servers to maintain state data (information about other computers on the network) beyond a certain size became compromised. In a network of a couple of dozen computers, most computer servers could readily keep track of the interactions between them, but in a larger network maintaining this information would very quickly swamp the memory of even the most advanced systems. This made it possible to expand networks to include millions of other computers, although it limited the number of operations that could be done between computers. This form of architecture provided connectedness by serving up pages in response to requests through URLs.</td>
