Amidst this mystery Chris, a researcher selecting material for the ships databanks, faces turmoil in his personal life. At times it's rather perceptive, like it's depiction of a army of researchers selecting and organising what cultural data the ship takes. (Since the colonists will effectively be cutoff from Earth, regardless of how much computer space is available you have select, record and organise what of their cultural background is going to be taken. ) Kube-McDowell is intelligent and brave enough to portray a society that has changed and is not self-concious about it.</td>
