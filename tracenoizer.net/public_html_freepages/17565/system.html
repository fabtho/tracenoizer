 There has been scattered work on the console and TTY layer going on for some time. This project will try to pull it all together into a coherent architecture from which we can generate clean patches for Linus and the core kernel team. The various subsystems are intertwined with the console system. Plus with the new design it is possible to use framebuffer devices without a VT. The console system input system is based solely on the input api.</td>
