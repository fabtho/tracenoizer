 , use the Java Accessibility API in all of the user-interface components of their applications. Vendors are building alternate user interfaces for the Java Foundation Classes to provide interfaces in non-traditional modalities, including the current development of low-vision and audio user interfaces for the JFC. Vendors are also building Assistive Technologies in Java, such as the IBM Special Needs Systems group, which is building a screen reader for the Java platform that will provide blind access to Java applications which support the Java Accessibility API. The many developers who are building products on top of the Java Foundation Classes are already automatically transparently using Java Accessibility to make their applications accessible. Since it is built into the Java Foundation Classes, which is core to the Java Platform and thus don't need to be ported from a different environment, developers will find that the Java Accessibility is very easy to use - virtually all of the work is done for them.</td>
