 Certainly, a competent, versatile teacher with a strong enthusiasm for the subject matter would be a good candidate regardless of his or her degree, etc. Since colleges and universities are experts in this area, SFA will support your decisions on teacher selection. If teachers are not senior fitness experts at first, they will be in short order. This is possible because SFA courses are so complete and well organized. We have done all of the advance work for your teacher.</td>

 Since it is built into the Java Foundation Classes, which is core to the Java Platform and thus don't need to be ported from a different environment, developers will find that the Java Accessibility is very easy to use - virtually all of the work is done for them. The IBM Special Needs Systems group has been a close partner in the development of the Java Accessibility API, and they have developed a set of Guidelines for Writing Accessible Applications in the Java programming language. This document describes in detail how to use the Java Accessibility API and the Java Foundation Classes in order to develop mainstream applications that are fully accessible. The Java Accessibility Bridge, which provides a mechanism for existing native Assistive Technologies to communicate with programs on the Java platform using the Java Accessibility API, requires platform-specific code and when released may function differently on different platforms. The Java Accessibility Utilities package includes a lot of accessibility support for AWT, providing mechanisms for externally monitoring all AWT events, and for externally retrieving the AWT object at any given point on the screen.</td>

 At the time of this writing, the only way to get XFree86 4 is via the Debian "testing" (or "unstable", of course) distribution. Most of the Debian packages described below are not available in the current Debian "stable" area. You will need to configure your system to be able to see the Debian "testing" or "unstable" areas in order to install them as I've described below. Other Resources Everything I learned about this process came from one or both of these two excellent resources (plus a bit of experimentation); you should keep them handy as you proceed through this setup. Obtaining TrueType Fonts The standard XFree86 base package does not provide any TrueType fonts.</td>
