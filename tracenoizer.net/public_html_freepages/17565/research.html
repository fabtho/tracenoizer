 And I hope my talk today will convince you that, in fact, maybe even if it is disappearing into the woodwork of computing, it remains a very vibrant and alive field. The goal of the Seven Issues paper - basically I took NoteCards as a foil or as a backdrop, against which to develop first an assessment of where I thought the hypermedia field was, the state of the art of building hypermedia systems was in 1986 or 1987. And then from that I tried to propose an agenda for future research and development in hypermedia systems, kind of a proposal for what we as a field should look at as the core set of problems that we should be approaching in the next few years or, as I phrased it then, "in building the third generation of hypermedia systems. I'm going to use the Seven Issues paper as a backdrop or a foil against which to again assess the current state of the art in hypermedia. ' Unlike in the '87 paper where I really tried to focus on the notion of hypermedia systems, I'd like to take a much broader perspective today and look at the larger world of hypermedia, systems included.</td>
