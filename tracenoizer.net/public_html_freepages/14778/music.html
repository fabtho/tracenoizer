 ."By Les Reynolds To say Joe McKay's debut CD is appropriately titled is an understatement. The cover on the 14-tune release (from Good Dog Music) depicts Joe with his guitar, wearing bib overalls and what looks like a railroad engineer''s cap as he sits on the front porch of what appears to be an old farmhouse. His face is wide and plain as he stares out into the distance. Joe actually grew up on a hog farm in Secaucus, New Jersey.</td>
