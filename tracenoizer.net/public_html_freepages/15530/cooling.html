 Heat Terminator is the very best hard drive cooling system we have seen. . The Heat Terminator implements a huge aluminum heat sink plus Two front panel cooling fans to provide the very best solution for hard drive heat build-up. Unlike competing products that are nothing but fans pushing air around the hard drive, the Heat Terminator combines the moving air principle with a large aluminum heat sink that simultaneously transfers heat away from the drive thereby extending hard drive life and reliability. Additionally, a removeable front panel filter is included that can easily be removed and washed for additional protection from dust and airborn particles.</td>
