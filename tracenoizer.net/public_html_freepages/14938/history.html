 It is currently a relatively small fraction of the content that we make available on our CD or in our public kiosks but we are working on a complete conversion of all our contents to the web. We hope to complete this process sometime in early 2001. We are presenting an unprecedented multidisciplinary view of San Francisco's history, but it is by no means the last word on any aspect of local history. We encourage people to amend, update, correct, and fill the holes of our shared past. Contact us with contributions, suggestions, criticisms.</td>
