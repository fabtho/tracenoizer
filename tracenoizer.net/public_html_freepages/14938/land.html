 Irrigation canals sizeable enough to be recorded by name numbered more than 100 in the documents of the eighth through tenth centuries. There were ateliers of specialists assigned to maintenance of the irrigation system. Some of the cadastral and judicial records from Dunhuang specify the amount and location of land held by families. The absolute quantities are probably less meaningful here than the fact that the land consisted of various separate parcels, scattered over the territory of a settlement. There seems to have been some system of land re-distribution to maintain some equality in the ability of the population to pay its obligations.</td>
