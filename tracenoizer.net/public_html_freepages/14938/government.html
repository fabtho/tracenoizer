 By the beginning of the 12th century they had already established the basis for the civilisation that was to develop into the two great state systems known as the Mwene Mutapa and Rozwi empires that successively dominated the area into the 19th century. Its greatest period of expansion was between 1450 and 1500 under King Mutota, and by the time of the arrival of the first Portuguese at the beginning of the 16th century its area of control included most of present-day Zimbabwe and large parts of present-day Mozambique. The central government maintained its power through a system of tribute from its vassals. By the beginning of the 17th century the Mutapa empire was in rapid decline as a result of its constant struggles with the invading Portuguese, coupled with a debilitating series of internal dynastic disputes. Beginning in the 14th century as a separate state from the Mutapa empire, the Rozwi kingdom reached its zenith in the 17th and 18th centuries.</td>
