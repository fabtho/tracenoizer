 . He's also not afraid of making strong statements and then immediately backing them up with the detail that makes sense of the outrageous. "There is no such thing as an IT strategy," he said at one point, going on to explain that technology must be seen as a business enabler. The IT strategy, therefore, must mirror business strategy -- but it must play a key role in determining what the business strategy is. This is not playing with words, but a fundamental repositioning of IT at the heart of the First Rand business.</td>

 "That is a market primarily dominated by larger banks and we believe there is an opportunity for a bank like ours to serve the small businesses there.

 This project investigates a database management system that supports a meta-query language with which users can design their own visual query languages to specify both the data to retrieve and the display format. Theoretical aspects of the research address the characterization of classes of visual queries that can be evaluated with guaranteed time-complexity by providing a careful design of the query evaluation engine. Practical goals include the implementation of a database management system supporting visual queries, the dissemination of results using the WWW, and the transfer of technology. The project has a strong educational component, seeking the involvement of graduate and undergraduate students and the inclusion of prototypes in the classroom so as to reflect the more interactive and visual aspects of today's computer science. Visual query languages will be key components of the next generation of declarative database interfaces because they take advantage of the user's visual perception to convey information efficiently.</td>
