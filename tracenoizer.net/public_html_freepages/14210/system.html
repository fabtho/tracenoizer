<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" The meeting noted that there have been notable successes as a result of the partnership between government and the business sector. Co-operation on priority crimes such as organised crime and vehicle syndicates. Improvement of service delivery trough mechanisms such as the provision of technology and management skills to the various components of the criminal justice system. Deputy President Zuma said the work of BAC was a practical example of the spirit of voluntarism and called for an extension of this spirit to other sectors and spheres of South African society. He said the partnership between BAC and government showed that something concrete was being done to fight crime in the country, and called for this pro-active initiative to be replicated.">

 Their successful implementation will provide database systems with fundamental capabilities not currently available. . This project investigates a database management system that supports a meta-query language with which users can design their own visual query languages to specify both the data to retrieve and the display format. Theoretical aspects of the research address the characterization of classes of visual queries that can be evaluated with guaranteed time-complexity by providing a careful design of the query evaluation engine. Practical goals include the implementation of a database management system supporting visual queries, the dissemination of results using the WWW, and the transfer of technology.</td>
