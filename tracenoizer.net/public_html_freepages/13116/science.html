 The SSDS customer community ranges from the NASA and international space science research communities to students, educators and the general public. . The Space Science Data System is the confederation of groups supported by NASA's Office of Space Science to provide public access to and to ensure the usability of science data from OSS missions and selected other data. Some SSDS groups develop tools and services for finding and using these data. Long-term data accessibility is ensured by SSDS archiving and preservation of the data.</td>
