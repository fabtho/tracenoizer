 But I think the story of how IBM killed the market for CUE illustrates very well what fledging software companies were up against in the early days of the software industry. . We had both previously worked for Control Data and were pioneers in developing engineering approaches to software development, which was a new concept at the time. To the best of my knowledge, though, this was the first use of the term in Silicon Valley. I had also specialized in developing software that would measure computer performance and we thought that there would be a big market for that kind of software product in the rapidly-growing IBM 360 customer base.</td>
