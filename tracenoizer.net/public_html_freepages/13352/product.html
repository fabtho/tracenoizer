 Away from the office, she can be found researching the best cycling routes in the Bay Area. . Those responsible for defining the product offering and marketing want reliable, measurable data to define success both incrementally and overall. Hard data helps us make choices about where to spend resources, but placing a product under the microscope every step of the way can also introduce as many opportunities for error as it avoids.

 We had both previously worked for Control Data and were pioneers in developing engineering approaches to software development, which was a new concept at the time.

I had also specialized in developing software that would measure computer performance and we thought that there would be a big market for that kind of software product in the rapidly-growing IBM 360 customer base. So the plan was to sell our services as software engineering consultants and get the money together to be able to develop some performance measurement products for the IBM 360 market. Software product companies were a really unknown concept so we had a hard time finding a venture capitalist who would listen to us.</td>
