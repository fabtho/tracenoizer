 The SPIRIT was launched and the twin engines driving the two paddle wheels, providing the sole power for the boat, were started up. Before the journey began, it was discovered that the paddle wheels were not quite strong enough to power the boat and the wheels collapsed. The wheels were reinforced and the sternwheeler departed from Morgan City on the Intracoastal Waterway to the Mississippi River on April 25, 1977. The SPIRIT of Dubuque entered the Mississippi River through the Port Allen Lock near Baton Route, LA. However, the batteries weren't charging properly, so the riverboat had to stay over-night in Baton Rouge.</td>

 And the formula for top honors was set a year ago, allowing students who came from public middle schools to exclude the high school courses they took there from the calculation of their grade-point averages.

" At academically competitive Spanish River, students begin plotting their trek to top honors before they enter high school, taking high school classes in middle school and college classes in high school. An A in a high-school level class equals four points; an A in a college-level class garners six. By earning As in college courses, Spanish River's top three students ended up with the highest averages in the school's history.</td>
