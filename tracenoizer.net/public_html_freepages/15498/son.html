 Chief among these characters are John's domineering mother, Queen Eleanor (formerly Eleanor of Aquitaine), and the Bastard, who supports the king and yet mocks all political and moral pretensions. Two brothers, Philip and Robert Faulconbridge, enter arguing over their inheritance. Eleanor recognizes the resemblance between Philip and her late son King Richard Coeur-de-lion. After Philip agrees to drop all claim to the Faulconbridge lands, his mother admits that he is, indeed, Richard's son. Thereafter, the Bastard, newly knighted as Sir Richard Plantagenet, becomes John's staunchest military commander in the war against France.</td>

When they didn't, he had made his point that, though the deeds of kings might appear 'great' in the minds of men, they were as nothing in the face of God's power. Canute (who is known as Knud in Denmark and Knut in Norway) was the son of Svein Forkbeard Canute's grandfather was Harald Bluetooth and his great-grandfather was King Gorm. In England, in the year 1000, the Saxon King Aethelred plundered the Isle of Man and parts of The Danelaw, to try to crush the independently-minded Scandinavians living there. Aethelred always feared a resurgence of Viking power in England.</td>
