 The Transylvanian Society of Dracula has long been aware of the frantic search of the meaning of the vampire on the part of the western researchers whose folkloric roots were cut by industrialization and post-industrialization, by Cartesian upbringing. . To that purpose they plan to dig up the remains of Prince Vlad Dracula, the Impaler (XV century) at the monastery of Snagov. This mistake alone brings doubts on the wisdom of resurrecting a man who would regard this confusion as an insult to his intelligence and punish the ignorants. The sad thing about Prince Vlad Dracula is that no one knows where he was buried.</td>

 4) When a Boyar complained of the screams and stench from the impaled Turks, Dracula had the Boyar impaled as well, though on a higher stake, above all others. Dracula built a castle at the headwaters of the Argas River. It was partly destroyed by the Turks in 1462 and the Prince had to flee for his life. He went northward and was taken prisoner by Hungarians. Dracula was released in 1474 as the Turks mounted a new offensive into Europe.</td>
