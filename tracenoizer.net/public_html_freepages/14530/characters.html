com With his pleasing, inviting voice and grassroots folk song style, Joe McKay is reminiscent of your musical Uncle Fred providing a good time at family functions with his singing and playing. McKay doesn't bowl over listeners with breathtaking metaphor or puzzling obliqueness--his songwriting style is fairly straightforward. In this release, we get to know some of the history and characters from a part of New Jersey heretofore unknown to most non-Garden Staters, the farming area around Secaucus. The title cut, "Backroad Joe," brings to mind Tennessee Ernie Ford's hit "16 Tons. " It uncannily depicts the cycle of life of a youth raised on a New Jersey pig farm.</td>
