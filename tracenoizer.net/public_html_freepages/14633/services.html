 Added to this is the great amount of innovation and entrepreneurial ability which has emerged following the deregulation of the industry in December 1998. What this means is that with private individuals and corporate bodies entering the call centre sector, the monopoly initially enjoyed by the previously state-owned telecommunications company was broken, thereby creating greater business choices for customers. Notably however, SWIFTCALL which started operation in the UK in 1993 had already hit the Irish market in 1994, offering pre-paid services years before the official deregulation. By this, the company was already equipped to confront the challenges that came with competition. SWIFTCALL's services and customer satisfaction have been eloquent testimonies of its operations which have spanned eight years.</td>
