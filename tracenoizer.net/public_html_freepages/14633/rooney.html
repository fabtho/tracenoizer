 We're tough on them, but I think it's a very positive tough. I think what we try to do is maintain a family concept, one where you're part of a big family here, and I think the kids pick up on that. Of course, incredible talent and hard work also have something to do with all the accolades and spectacular achievements, said Rooney, who recently added the 1999 Greater Madison Distinguished Service Award to a long list of honors he has collected since arriving here in 1982. From NFL halftime shows to presidential inaugurals to the performance in Monaco for the 700th anniversary of the Grimaldi family's reign, Rooney said the biggest head-turner for his Marching Royal Dukes so far may have been winning the 1994 Sudler Trophy as the country's top collegiate marching band. Geographically, a third of band members normally hail in from northern Virginia, which Rooney called one of the country's hotbeds for band talent.</td>

 . He has been a member of the board since 1990 and will continue to serve in that capacity. A 1958 graduate of The University of Findlay, Rooney served as the co-chair of the Horizons Fund capital campaign in 1986-89 and served on the Alumni Board of Governors during 1976-77. He was named a Distinguished Associate in 1987 for his leadership and consistent support (both volunteer and financial) and was selected as a Distinguished Alumnus in 1993 for his lifetime achievements and service to the institution. Moving up the ranks, he was elected vice president of the Cooper brand in 1969.</td>
