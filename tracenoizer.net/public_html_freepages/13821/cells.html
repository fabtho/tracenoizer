 The Philippine virus was therefore a rhabdovirus, but the present study did not establish its role in the epizootiology of EUS. . The virus was isolated using snakehead spleen cells (SHS) from severely lesioned epizootic ulcerative syndrome (EUS)-affected snakehead Ophicephalus striatus from Laguna de Bay, in January 1991. The virus induced cytopathic effects (CPE) in SHS cells yielding a titer of 3. Other susceptible cell lines included bluegill fry (BF-2), catfish spleen (CFS) and channel catfish ovary (CCO) cells.</td>

 By default, the help string is the value of the cell, if the cell is not blank. If blank, the cell returns a help string that can be configured on a per-cell basis. I added some help strings for some of the non-obvious cells (like Num). If you think other cells need help strings, let me know, or send me a patch. The date cell's help string is the date printed out in full, with names for the day of the week and the month, according to the current locale.</td>
