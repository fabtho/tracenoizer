 The apoptotic deletion of activated T cells has been proposed as the key mechanism to maintain T cell homeostasis, and in this respect CD95 (fas antigen) seems to play a major role in this course of events. This study reports our analysis on 140 healthy individuals arranged in different groups starting on cord blood to 91 years old. Our results show that in the course of growing, just collected lymphocytes, show a progressive increase of expression of the apoptosis molecule CD95. At 60 years of age until 91 the expression of CD95 reaches the higher level. The expression of CD95 fits well with the spontaneous apoptosis observed in the different groups.</td>

 Bored to tears, we have taken to snuffling what appears to be cornstarch up our noses, turning our brains to gravy. And everything is just about perfect except the simplistic flowers we smell give off the scent of the pungent Socks of Gymnasium. Nouveau riche camel drivers who tend the pipes from which Lio's wealth flows, concerned that soon they may have little left to sell other than sand for fifty cents a bushel and goat droppings at ten dollars a ton, will demand an increase in gold tribute for every flagon of Lio juice, increasing the value of the tribute geometrically. There will be much bitching and moaning by us about Lio juice rationing, so we will kill a number of the well keepers and feel better about having done so. Lio will have totally altered all our lives in scarcely a century and a half, and then will withdraw from us, little by little, while we fight each other for what remains of our once generous servant's gifts.</td>
