 Arthur and Remko's performance work involves using electric shocks to trigger muscle contraction. Ken is a winner of Oscar for his groundbreaking work on computer rendering and his work on films such as Tron. His keynote presentation will be on one of his current main areas of interest - creating virtual characters with realistic and believable behaviour. People who have been impressed by the virtual environments such as Desert Rain will be interested in the numerous presentations that we have on the technology and aesthetics of interactive virtual environments. We have presentations by two of the artists shortlisted for this year's Electronic Literature Association award - Mez Breeze and Paul Chan.</td>
