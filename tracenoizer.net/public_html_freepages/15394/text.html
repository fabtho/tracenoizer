 " This question is one that holds importance for many online art events and projects that need to physically supplement their electronically-tethered existence. There is much emphasis placed on the minimal in the layout of the book; a pared down black, white and gray aesthetic presented in a calmed ray-gunesque format without the frantic clutter. The images are stark overall, the text being the primary focal point. The ensemble logic book and CD ROM are essentially ancillary artifacts. Artifacts devoid of that vital spark that was crucial to the eWRe sites success in emulating the wonderfully charged network medium in which it was presented.</td>

 Refracted populations survive to modulate the first thought from the sea in fatal stardust phenomes as hubbling tellerscopes chemically benthamise the operratic signtist archipeligos of alienation and silicon singularities coaxed from the matter inhibitors of sibling nature. The convolving data patterns intrastructure soft slippages for masked crusaders whose hoaxes are to netoir what spectating elephants are to homeless circuses. An extended wager connects responsive imagery and digital spaces with exploratory human-machine systems, including collaborative telepathogenic, text generation, speech recognition and artificial vision clusters. Possesses BA, IBM Broadband Scholarship and postgrad quals in Design Computing. Engaged in design and development of experimental medical software at Sydney University since 1997.</td>

 the communication mechanism between perception, emotion and bodily change. html Run the poem and inspect the Frozen Gifs Gallery 6. Exquisite, iconic visual-design features are counterpoised with more mundane magazine text-snippets referring (pronominally) to men. Because the snippets themselves are appropriated material, the whole collage can be read as a critique of socio-journalistic constructions of male identity. But the greatest power of the piece resides in its truly striking graphic design elements (of which an image of two birds pecking at seed, as objective correlative for marriage, is one unforgettable instance).</td>
