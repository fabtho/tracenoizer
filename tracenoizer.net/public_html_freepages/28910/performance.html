<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" After this, the plot moves to a theatrical agency and the tension dissipates. Not only are the gang hypnotising sailors for information, but they're also sending messages via a radio harmonica player, and running several small businesses at the same time. Tom Walls as the head of the agency gives a fascinating performance, but there are too many minor villains cluttering up the action to give him room to really let rip. He's rarely without a smile and completely avoids that air of sour menace that was his forte. He sparks off Joyce Howard and brings out the best in her.">

 The operator, or 'pianolist', achieves dynamic shading of the music by varying the degree of pressure applied to the foot pedals. In addition, a set of hand-operated levers mounted just below the front of the keyboard provide accentuation, tempo control, activation of the sustain and soft pedals and selection of play and rewind modes. It is true to say that in the hands of an accomplished operator, a convincingly lifelike performance is achievable. The player piano enjoyed its peak of popularity between 1900 and 1930, after which time the gramophone, which was significantly cheaper, became the main source of home entertainment. As the vast majority of player pianos are now at least seventy years old and many are sadly dilapidated, enthusiasts all over the world are devoting much time and energy to the restoration of these truly remarkable instruments.</td>
