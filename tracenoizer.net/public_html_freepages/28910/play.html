Anna Neagle was the obvious choice to play this very British heroine, and Herbert Wilcox does his usual careful job behind the camera. When he discovers his companions are drug-dealing he wants out but they frame him. It's a hard film which might have been better as an American film noir.">

 The player mechanism is powered entirely by suction, generated by the operation of two foot pedals, while the music is represented by tiny perforations on interchangeable rolls of paper. The operator, or 'pianolist', achieves dynamic shading of the music by varying the degree of pressure applied to the foot pedals. In addition, a set of hand-operated levers mounted just below the front of the keyboard provide accentuation, tempo control, activation of the sustain and soft pedals and selection of play and rewind modes. It is true to say that in the hands of an accomplished operator, a convincingly lifelike performance is achievable. The player piano enjoyed its peak of popularity between 1900 and 1930, after which time the gramophone, which was significantly cheaper, became the main source of home entertainment.</td>
