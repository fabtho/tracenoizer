 On the French trip I remember a lot about Normandy. I also remember finding a bullet on a beach in Normandy. I looked for a bullet for 20 min, and then I found one. On my last day in France I bought a sword which was really cool and neat. I have taken 192 pictures of France and will soon get them developed.</td>

 It's not a classic but it is entertaining and essential viewing for any James Mason fan. Here it's the Welsh Guards, so naturally the film concentrates on an Englishman, Irishman and an American and their relationship through the war. A charitable man might think that maybe they couldn't find enough Welsh stars around to build a film on, but the 'stars' here are Edward Underdown, Ralph Clanton and Michael Brennen so they couldn't have looked very hard. Another in Gainsborough's run of loony melodramas (though in modern dress) and it's still very entertaining. It's pure soap opera but with a more grown-up attitude to life than many of the period.</td>
