 The European Union and many developing countries have said they plan to pursue ratification of the treaty even without the involvement of the United States, the largest emitter of heat-trapping gases. The leading industrial nations, at their summit meeting in Genoa, Italy, told President Bush on Saturday that that they intended to ratify the protocol by next year. The Europeans particularly have said they hope that a change in administration or rising public pressure might prompt the United States eventually to participate. Some people involved in the talks said they found it ironic that the document held many concessions that the Clinton administration had sought, but failed to get, from Europe in the Netherlands. This time, Europe appeared willing to accept the same ideas, still endorsed by former American negotiating partners, in their eagerness for closure.</td>

 Tudjman decreed that Croatia should adopt a red-and-white checkerboard coat of arms that closely resembles the symbol of the Ustashe state. Since its adoption in 1848, the flag has always contained three equal bands of red, white and blue. The only change has been to the emblem in the center of the flag. After the Communist takeover, the Communist red star was placed in the middle of the flag where it remained until 1990. The red star has been replaced not by an Ustashe symbol but by Croatia's traditional coat of arms which may have had its beginning in Croatia as far back as the 11th century.</td>

 have from time to time suffered martyrdom as being disobedient to the State. Ordinary criminals may be hanged - those guilty of Treason are hanged, drawn and quartered. Racks and thumbscrews are used to persuade the heretic to change his or her beliefs. Daniel's furnace is heated "seven times hotter" than usual. The persecution of the Jews throughout history, whether by Antiochus Epiphanes or Adolf Hitler, has been of quite exceptional cruelty.</td>
