 The team has identified the number of hours of special education assistant support needed (report as hours per week). The team has identified a preliminary plan for how the team is thinking of utilizing the assistant. Remember, the assistant is to support the whole school system. 1)____________(Remember early release) From the total hours per week, minus out hours per week the student will receive direct service from special education teachers and related service providers. Call or E-mail Special Programs when you want to use these hours, and we will write the PAR allowing the assistant to be paid for these monthly training hours.</td>

Now a functional plan is developed determining the direction of the communications system to satisfy needs today and in the future. A functional design is created and an implementation plan is established. Once approval is obtained, contracts are drafted to include an overall scope of work pertaining to the project in as much detail as possible.</td>

(The "how") We know our priorities and people seem clear about their priorities. We have a coherent management philosophy and system in place. Managers are well trained and people are supported producing. Generally we know "how" we should work together to get things done.</td>
