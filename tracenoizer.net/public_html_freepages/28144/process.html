 In the Symbolic Simulation Technique, sometimes called the Wizard of Oz Technique, a human expert acts like an expert system, intercepting help messages from the user and providing advice in the problem-solving task. In Storyboarding, the ultimate system is portrayed by a series of nonfunctional display screens that depict a typical sequence of interactions between user and system. Some critique-type KATs present, as a stimulus for criticism, parts of the conceptual structure of the decision process being modeled by the expert system. Thus, for example, the Teachback Technique has the KE telling the SME how the process works, the SME pointing out remaining flaws in the KE's conceptualization. Likert Elicitations use Likert Scale items to elicit criticism.</td>

Prodi says the European Union must start adapting its institutions and establish more coherence in its policies so that it is easier to see what it stands for and what it does. He says the White Paper reforms will open up the policy making process and get more people involved in shaping policy in Brussels. This he believes will overcome the hostility or indifference towards European institutions. The White Paper's proposals for change call for 'better involvement and more openness' .</td>

 The application must be accompanied by supporting documentation from each of these parties. Absolute levels of sales will not necessarily be the deciding factor. Elements such as quality of service, a creative thought process, understanding client objectives, honesty and professionalism will be taken into consideration by the judges. Entrants must simply write to the CRCA stating that they would like to be considered for this award. All national sales teams will be assessed by the heads of radio at some of the top buying points in London who will rank the team on key service areas.</td>
