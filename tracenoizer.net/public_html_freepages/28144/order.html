 Canoe Country Camping has even been praised by relatively veteran canoe campers because they've found within better ways of doing things, ways they might not have thought of themselves, and several area outfitters recommend it to their clients as a good read before they show up for their trip.

 Crime, ostensibly, is the State's way of punishing the moral sins set out in the Ten Commandments. There is therefore something semi-sacred in causing evil to those who have broken the Law. And Judges and Lawyers, just like Doctors, Royalty and academics, have a funny way of dressing up in robes like Priests in order to emphasize the unquestionable mystery of all that they are doing in this direction. If we think it is connected with the Ten Commandments, there's a surprise coming. A religion decreed by the State is passe - though a sop is given to churches in certain tax advantages to clergy, church properties, and charitable donors.</td>
