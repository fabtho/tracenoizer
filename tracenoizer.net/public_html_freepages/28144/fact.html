 A massive candle-light demonstration condemning this attack took place soon thereafter in Zagreb. Kinzer failed to state who was responsible for the attack. A highly-publicized trial in Belgrade, apparently taking place because of Milosevic's attempts to purge his army of men he considers to be unreliable, revealed that the bombing in Zagreb was in fact carried out by two Serbs working with the Yugoslav secret police.

Lies are a good example, the exasperating fact that violence drives truth out of the window. The cartoon on page 54 shows two identical frames of Mr Gerry Adams talking about reconciliation, democracy and his Protestant brothers.
