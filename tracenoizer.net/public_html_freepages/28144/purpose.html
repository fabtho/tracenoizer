 Our culture is well integrated, that is, we know the implicit and explicit values and we are aligned on those values. There are no "different cultures" in the company at large. We have guidelines for how we will work together for the purpose of producing cooperatively. We are able to effectively communicate regarding mission, strategy tactics and deliverables. We are willing to influence each other as well as being open to influence.</td>

 Or the task can be analyzed for the steps or subtasks in the task procedure, to design a decision aid, an expert system, or some other function support. One of the recurring problems with task descriptions is the level at which the task is defined (Rasmussen, 1986). Often the purpose of the Task Analysis, or the purpose of the decision aid for which the Task Analysis is performed, will determine the level at which the tasks should be conceptualized. Many KEs have an explicit interest in the inputs and the outputs of the human decision maker, because they want to construct a decision aid that operates on the input information and helps the human produce the output, that is, make the decision. Several KATs focus on the inputs or, as we have termed them, the information requirements of the decision-making task.</td>
