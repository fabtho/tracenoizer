 This discussion primarily concerns diesels but I'm sure someone may be able to apply these ideas to steam locomotives as well. The small size of the speakers are inadequate to duplicate the sound of full size locomotives (the roar of a sixteen cylinder prime mover cannot adequately be reproduced through a three inch speaker). When more than one train is equipped with a sound system, the conflicting sounds can quickly become overwhelming. Locomotive sounds can become annoying after a while when there are several engines on the layout so equipped (this is especially true for someone not actively involved in the running of a train. The sound can carry to other rooms in the house possibly annoying non-railroaders occupying the same building).</td>

 . If you like what you hear, head on over to the main page for that band for news, information, upcoming shows and direct links to more mp3's off-site -- or you can click on the album covers below to head directly to our pages on mp3. We hope you'll share our mp3's with the Napster community and with the whole grand world -- and please take a moment while the sounds are downloading to read a bit about our happening and hardworking indie artists. The raging dinosaur at right belongs, of course, to our newest release, Natural Selection by The Dan Emery Mystery Band. Early responses to this brash and gleeful CD are coming in with thumbs up, kind of like in Gladiator but with Dan instead of Russell Crowe .</td>
