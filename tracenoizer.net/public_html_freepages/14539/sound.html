 Please send all acrimonious, slanderous, and critical comments to me here at the Lackawanna Terminal Railway's general offices. . Sound systems in HO Hi all, In July of 1996, I sent the following letter to Mr. John Atkinson who moderates the Electronics Symposium in Model Railroader Magazine (a Kalmbach publication). The letter, which was sent to the address listed in the magazine, was returned as "Addressee unknown" (or something like that).</td>

 My phone number has changed (again) so disregard all the other numbers except for the (702) 995-3217 voicemail. All I can say is there are an awful lot of embarrassed Mike Ho's here. For best sound quality, please dial (435) 302-2088 directly. The toll free number doesn't allow me to access messages digitally. (I also don't check my 800-number voice mail as often.</td>
