 . Drowned in sound Get a profile, rate bands, send notes - try out the new user area . Those loveable welsh scamps Mo-ho-bish-o-pi are quite possibly no more. Although not official has yet been released, rumours have been strengthened due to the fact that Martin (Bimrose) will be starting his own band called Telephone. I'll never perform anything by Mo-ho-bish-o-pi again.</td>

by Cat Majors My birth was a "Dream Birth," better than I could have ever imagined. I am indeed, after two years, still reeling from the exuberant empowerment of it. I caught Max myself in a bathtub of lovely relaxing warm water - and he was born in a "laugh," as I was vocalizing a HO - HO - HO sound ( a very open sound which came instinctually). My husband was in the kitchen at the time, nervously making and re-making coffee, because he thought that we were going to have to go to the hospital soon. (Nature's way of granting a mother the highest feeling of her life.</td>

 Like Ho's own Cubist piece that adorns the album cover, 'Universal' is a real masterpiece. . Having enjoyed huge critical acclaim with 'Voices' it's hardly surprising Ho hasn't gone off on a new artistic tangent for 'Universal'. Instead, his third album sees him refine his sound, drop the tempo and take in more jazz, ethnic and groovy house elements. It's best typified on tracks like the funky and down right sexy groove of 'Palace' or the textured, tech tones of 'Running', where insistently hypnotic percussion is fused with jazzy stabs to make music that is both challenging, inventive and entertaining.</td>
