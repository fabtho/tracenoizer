 Duck Dodgers isn't perfect, but it shows a lot of effort and creativity within the context of basic Mario-inspired platform action. The personality of Daffy and the Looney Tunes world is captured flawlessly in this title. The graphics are bright and colorful, bringing the cartoon to life. Daffy's comments are as irritating as ever - I wouldn't have it any other way. The levels are very basic with little touches of Looney fun.</td>
