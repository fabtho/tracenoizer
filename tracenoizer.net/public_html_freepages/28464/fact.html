Although we can have encoding without a corresponding schema, it's not recommended. Most XML parsers will soon be schema-aware (in fact, some like Xerces already are), and we can save ourselves a lot of trouble when parsing messages if we rely on the parser and schema to validate and convert data instead of doing it manually. SOAP Encoding The SOAP Specification defines a single set of encoding rules that are referred to as SOAP encoding. SOAP encoding is based on XML Schemas and as such it closely models many of the standard types and constructs that developers would be familiar with.">

 . Department of Health and Human Services This Page Has Moved This directory was created in 1994 in anticipation of the Department's usage of the Internet. In fact, the HHS Internet presence is highly decentralized, and this directory now only adds to the length of a web page's location. Please take this opportunity to change your bookmark. We are forwarding you to our Agencies web page, so you can more easily locate the organization you wish to visit.</td>

 Installing the Real One PlayerOk, finally the Real One Player is downloaded, and it's time to install it. (blah, blah, blah) is a LEGAL AGREEMENT between you and RealNetworks. " So NOW, I have to be aware of the fact that this product ALSO contains 3rd party software, and by agreeing to THIS agreement I am also agreeing to THEIR agreements. As far as I am concerned, IBM basically screwed the world when it agreed to LICENSE Microsoft Windows from Bill Gates. .</td>

 Why go through the cost and the hassles of finding a money-making product. Are you really interested in wasting the next 3 to 5 years of your life trying to nail-down a winning product. Not to mention the fact that, after you go through all the time and expense of researching a product -- the darn thing may not even sell. We're giving you the chance right here to have total reprint and duplication rights to several, proven cash-generating products. products that have already been tried and tested -- along with ready-to-use ads, sales letters, and press releases you can use to sell these products like crazy.</td>
