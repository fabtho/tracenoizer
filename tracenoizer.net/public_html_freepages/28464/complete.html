<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" Students arrive at the room with an adult and then begin their sensory integration activities. Each piece of equipment is color-coded and the students have a well-developed routine to follow as they go from station to station. Students who could not sit straight in their chairs receive balance therapy and are able to go back to their classrooms and complete their assignments. In addition to the obvious relief this room provides, the program gives staff, parents and students an opportunity to appreciate the uniqueness of each individual and what it takes to create an optimal learning environment for all students. While this program has been created to meet the sensory needs of special education students, it has potential in the regular education setting.">
