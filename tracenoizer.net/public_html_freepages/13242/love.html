 They usually give you an unbelievable amount of joy. LIFETIME relationships teach you lifetime lessons; those things you must build upon in order to have a solid emotional foundation. It is said that love is blind but friendship is clairvoyant. ..</td>

 Despite this underachieving percussionist, the band began to develop a good following. Not wanting to settle for average they are now auditioning drummers while recording a new demo, and writting music with Josh playing drums and guitar. The goal of the band is to create and great scene where lots kids can come out and have a blast listening to music, while showing love and serving everyone they come across. Juvenile Actions sound would best be described as the child of bigwig, strung out, hatebreed, and mxpx. Percussion Plus, Tama, and Pearl drums and hardware.</td>

 they are misinformed and may not know the whole story. how things affect the readers is up to them, everything that is produced, printed, or consumed will need a disclaimer - "don't be stupid. the new wave of electronic beats, drummers, and pro tools has taken a negative effect on the bands i love. the problem with enjoying unique bands is that they drastically change with each album. egomaniacs like thom yorke (radiohead) and billy corgan (smashing pumpkins) will let thier music suffer, so long as we label them 'creative' or 'doing something new'.</td>
