 One thing we realize was that the methodology was not the most central thing in the conference. Our impression is that more work needs to be done in this area. More clear insight into the development of the methodology could be beneficial to all projects dealing with concept development or normative analysis of possibilities the future has to offer. It is obvious that there is need for tools to conceptualize, to analyse research material (in all levels) this could be an interesting and emerging point for future research projects, because it is obvious that most of the groups experienced the same kind of problems. There was a strong presence of projects with technological orientation, in most of the cases the problem lies in the fact that they had nothing really new in them, or very little to say in terms of real applications.</td>

 The results of the project can be seen in the Modern Time Forum at the Lasipalatsi within a production called The Land of The Midnight Sun or from the following web address www. . The design of The Future Learning Environment, embodies a model of progressive inquiry, which relies on recent achievements of cognitive research on educational practices and computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL). In the design of FLE, special emphasis has been given to developing metacognitive tools for structuring users' activity.

 Arpenteur has been designed under Java as an applet to be run on ordinary browsers like Netscape Navigator or Microsoft Internet Explorer. Ales Cepek from Technical University of Prague presented his GaMa application which is a public service on the Internet for adjustment of local geodetic networks. In future XML will be used for presentation of results as well in order to ease communication between subsequent applications. One remarkable benefit of this kind of open source application is that the software becomes debugged by various data. The application of Blackboard in Kingston is an example of a community wide solution, where a full commitment rate is expected within 2005, i.</td>
