 Memorandum for FIG Bulletin FIG Commission 2 Working Group 2. The 2001 meeting was organized as a two-day workshop where existing applications were exercised, and it was followed by seminar in which theoretical aspects of virtual education were discussed. During the workshop it became evident that necessary tools and technology for operating and managing distance learning programs and individual courses are available and in active use.
