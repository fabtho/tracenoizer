 fle is something i was involved with a bit about a year ago and it has come along in great 7 league strides since then, and deserves some serious attention and credit. here at intermedia it's being evaluated for an education project using agents, but i'd like to get it running and get some students in there quicksmart. this seems to combine some services for the uni (media development) with teaching and research which would make it a very interesting model. then the uni of art and design in helsinki, home of the media centre lume. in media arts this place has a department of film and tv, dept design for theatre film and tv, the media lab, and elomedia a doctorate school in audiovisual arts.</td>

 the setting and the possibility to talk and share was beneficial. .org) The i3 is formed out of different research groups with a multidisciplinary and multicultural background, working in various kinds of sub projects. The spring days are meant to offer these community a common ground to share their advances, problems encountered and to discuss interests and links across projects. Due to the multidisciplinary nature of the community, the format of the different workshops was quite open and diverse.</td>
