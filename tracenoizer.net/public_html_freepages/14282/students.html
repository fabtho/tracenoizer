 The Studio contains communication tools (news group in www and real time Java chat with whiteboard) and applications for creating mind maps (Java-applet) and WWW- based multimedia presentations (WWW-editor). The Meeting Room contains same communication tools as the Studio plus applications for cooperative work and for making new learning materials. The Gallery is a space of exhibition of presentations made by the students. The report will be published in the end of January 1998. In future the learning environment and the materials can be offered for use in other school districts in Finland and abroad.</td>

 there are a series of contexts attached to each video so that which ever one is frontmost determines the rest of the set via these contexts (themes) and where you are in the entire work. fle is something i was involved with a bit about a year ago and it has come along in great 7 league strides since then, and deserves some serious attention and credit. here at intermedia it's being evaluated for an education project using agents, but i'd like to get it running and get some students in there quicksmart. this seems to combine some services for the uni (media development) with teaching and research which would make it a very interesting model. then the uni of art and design in helsinki, home of the media centre lume.</td>
