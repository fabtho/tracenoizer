 We felt that we wanted to support EML and to raise awareness about it. FLe3 is a specialized application that has been designed to help study groups interested in collaborative learning to engage in research-type learning processes. The system makes use of the progressive enquiry process of knowledge building. The starting point is to create a context for the study project in order to anchor the chosen issues to the central principles of the knowledge domain in question. This helps to gives students an understanding of why the issues in question are worth studying.</td>
