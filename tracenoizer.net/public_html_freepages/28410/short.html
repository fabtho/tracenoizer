 This interest was likely the result of a convergence of factors, including increased attention to foreign language learning for English speakers, research on effective programs for educating language minority students, and the availability of federal and state funding for programs using this approach. A goal of the study, and of this report, is to assist current and prospective programs with their planning by giving them a picture of what other programs are doing. Following a short review of the goals and rationale for two-way programs, the results of the study will be discussed. Two-way programs share many features but vary in significant ways as well, and these areas of variability in implementation will be a focus of this report. There are also a number of unanswered questions about how to handle certain issues; concerns that were voiced by schools during the course of the study will be raised in the next section.</td>
