 We are in the process of characterizing the efficacy of various formulations of a ragweed-CpG conjugate to prevent or reverse allergic asthma in a canine model of asthma. . Barrett's research is to understand the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms which mediate the genetic and environmental factors that contribute to the development and exacerbation of asthma. Three areas of research that are directed toward these goals include the contribution of ultrafine particles (air pollutants) in the development and exacerbation of asthma, maternal influence in asthma, and development of an asthma vaccine. Effects of Inhaled Ultrafine Particles on Asthma Epidemiological studies show that hospital admissions for asthma are positively associated with the concentrations of particulate matter (PM) in the air.</td>

 The imaging scientists have been busy since then preparing for rendezvous with Saturn, and examining the results of the Jupiter encounter. At present, Cassini is roughly midway between the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn, rushing to meet its appointment with the ringed planet on July 1, 2004. We were fortunate to capture the birth and development of a dark spinning vortex in the north jovian auroral region resembling the development of stratospheric ozone holes on Earth. These disturbances appear to arise solely within the confines of the circumpolar high-altitude region of both planets. We will have this question in mind as we attempt to understand the origin of this new phenomenon observed for the first time by Cassini's Imaging Science experiment.</td>
