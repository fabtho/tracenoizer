gov is a student gateway to information and services from the United States government, bringing together a wide variety of information and services. Through this site you can find the right college, get information about and apply for federal student aid, learn about other educational benefits, and much more. The Families' Guide to the 1997 Tax Cuts for Education site helps explain these education tax benefits with some examples showing how they work under different circumstances.

IRS Publication 520 describes tax provisions related to Scholarships and Fellowships.</td>
