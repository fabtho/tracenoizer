 During that time not a single independent Irish film was made without some, if not a large part of assistance, being given by the board. Despite the fact that it was a very small organisation with a very limited budget and a very small number of staff it proved to be one of the most cost-effective Government agencies in the whole State. It seems particularly foolish, even in times of economic cutbacks, to abolish an organisation which used their resources so productively and creatively. There is no evidence that any substitute body or existing body could assume those duties. The Irish Film Board gave pre-production development money to people trying to initiate the making of films.</td>
