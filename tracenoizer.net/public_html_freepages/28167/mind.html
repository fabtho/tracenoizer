 Some physicists even believe that, but the Wu Li Masters know that they are only dancing with it.

 . But while the latter sank almost without trace Psycho went on to be a box-office smash, spawned a host of imitators, and created a new genre - the slasher movie. Don't be too concerned with the plot (undoubtedly the product of a sick mind and all the better for it) or the acting (which is average), instead concentrate on the way the story is told for it is Hitchcock's technically brilliant mastery of film-making that gives this film its classic status. The imagery is vivid and effective, from the stuffed birds with which Bates is obsessed to the crown of hayforks which frame the blonde's sister's head at one point. There is the feral screeching of Bernard Herrmann's now infamous score; there is the "metaphysical vertigo" of the overhead shot as Bates drags his mother down to the cellar; but most famous of all is the narrative twist that is the first murder.</td>

The Dancing Wu Li Masters remains an engaging, accessible way to meet the most profound and mind-altering insights of 20th-century science. com Gary Zukav's American Book Award-winning The Dancing Wu Li Masters masterfully introduces the layman to quantum and particle physics, as well as Einstein's relativity theories. With a similar dose of amiable, easy-to-understand prose, Zukav guides readers into the spiritual realm in his bestselling The Seat of the Soul.</td>
