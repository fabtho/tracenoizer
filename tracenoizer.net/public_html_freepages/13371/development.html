 As the committe concluded, Sugai was asked to offer his observations on the priority of IDEA provisions in resource-scare or under-funded school districts, and how quality teacher preparation might address some of the issues raised during the hearing regarding adequate learning or behavior supports for children. But we've also learned it is a question of enhancing a school's capacity. Because even if you give great attention to the professional development of a teacher, the minute that teacher walks into a school culture where those positive behaviors are not supported, and there is no plan in place to address problem behaviors, all that professional development doesn't make much of an impact. If there are violent or destructive behaviors, then what plan is in place to address them. If there are many disruptive behaviors schoolwide, what is the ongoing plan to address them.</td>
