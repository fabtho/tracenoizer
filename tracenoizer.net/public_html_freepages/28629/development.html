 Office of University Industry Research Relations (OUIRR) Roles University of Virginia Patent Foundation The Patent Foundation (PF) evaluates the intellectual property value and commercial research, and where warranted, seeks to patent those inventions and license them to industry. The Patent Foundation serves to promote the entry of University of Virginia-developed technologies into the commercial marketplace, and to generate royalties which are then used to support further research. The PF also supports and encourages local economic development by licensing to established and newly formed local companies, and serves as a University-wide resource for information about intellectual property and licensing.
