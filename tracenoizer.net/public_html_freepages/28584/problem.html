 Software Problems Macintosh Troubleshooting Manual Software Problems (primarily NON-Apple System Software related) Software problems are harder to troubleshoot, and potentially much more time consuming. Duplication of non-fatal software problems are crucial to their troubleshooting. Without duplication, it is essentially impossible to authoritatively state anything about the nature or cause of the problem. This is when the screen shot idea becomes essential. If the problem cannot be easily duplicated, then the user should attempt, if at all possible, to call for help the next sequential time the problem happens.</td>
