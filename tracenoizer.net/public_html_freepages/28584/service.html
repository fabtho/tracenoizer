 Place your printed maps in plastic folders for protection against the elements. Trying to read a road map while standing on a rainy street corner has its obvious disadvantages.

 Early on, they returned canceled checks with each statement; some years back they started batching the checks, returning them only twice a year, to save on postage. In my case, that means a minimum of three statements per month, at 27 cents postage each. So I called up, endured their voicemail system and a five-minute hold, and asked the customer-service person what's going on. It seems they've just "enhanced" (her term) their computer system, and one of its "features" now is that it kicks out a statement every time there's activity, whether you want one or not. They also want copies of any correspondence mentioning marijuana.</td>
