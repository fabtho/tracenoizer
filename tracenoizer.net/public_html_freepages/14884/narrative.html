 Based loosely on the story of Gary Gilmore, Cremaster 2 will add a dark very sharp edge to the series. And that edge might inspire something akin to what Beuys said about healing the knife that cuts the wound. But even if Mailer himself appears on screen and speaks dialogue based on his book, even if the story of Gilmore alone is rather renowned, and even if it all seems easier to follow because of a few words and a few names, Barney might say the narrative is just a coat-hanger for something else. Matthew Barney came to Dublin and brought his Cremaster, but like any good artist (especially one who would consider the magician Houdini a role model), he gave none of his secrets away. But I did get to chat a little with the soft-spoken, easy-smiling but intense Mr.</td>
