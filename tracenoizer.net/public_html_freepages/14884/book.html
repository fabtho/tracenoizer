 In this exhibition, the Walker Art Center presents the world premiere of Matthew Barneys latest film, Cremaster 2. n this installment of Barneys ongoing Cremaster cycle, an elliptical narrative unfolds around the films anti-hero, convicted killer Gary Gilmore, who is played by Barney himself. Loosely based on the life of Gilmore as chronicled by Norman Mailer in his book The Executioners Song, the film moves from a glacier field in the Canadian Rockies to the Bonneville Salt Flats, from Utah in 1976 to Chicago in 1893. Featured in the cast of Cremaster 2 are Norman Mailer and Dave Lombardo, former lead drummer for the band Slayer. Composer Jonathan Bepler provides the original musical score for the film, with vocals by Steve Tucker of Morbid Angel and Patty Griffin.</td>

 com MORBID ANGEL'S STEVE TUCKER LENDS VOCAL TALENTS TO UPCOMING FILM PROJECT WITH MATTHEW BARNEY AND NORMAN MAILER MORBID ANGEL vocalist and bassist Steve Tucker will make his cinematic vocal debut later this year as a contributor to the score of filmmaker Matthew Barney's newest work, CREMASTER 2. Tucker recorded his vocal parts in New York City during a break in Morbid Angel's recently concluded 'Formulas Fatal To The Flesh' 1999 World Tour. CREMASTER 2 is loosely based on the life of Gary Gilmore, who was immortalized in Norman Mailer's epic book 'The Executioner's Song. The cast includes Barney as Gilmore and Norman Mailer as Harry Houdini. CREMASTER 2's score is composed by Jonathan Bepler with contributions from Tucker, Patty Griffin, and a drum solo from legendary heavy metal performer Dave Lombardo.</td>

 And his sculptures are three-dimensional incarnations of the characters and settings. Conceived as a comprehensive overview of the entire series, the exhibition will feature the major sculptures created for the CREMASTER cycle. The book functions as a comprehensive guidebook to the entire project, revealing the artist's working methods and tracing the interconnected narrative threads of the cycle as a whole. Two major essays articulate the CREMASTER cycle's multivalent themes and explore Barney's innovative and unprecedented aesthetic vocabulary. Authors include Barney specialist Neville Wakefield and exhibition curator Nancy Spector.</td>
