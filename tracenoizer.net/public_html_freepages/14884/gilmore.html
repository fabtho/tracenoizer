The scene immediately preceding when Gilmore murders the gas station attendant and thus begins his infamous killing spree, has him parked in a shiny Mustang that is seamlessly connected to another Mustang by a tunnel linking the two cars. The tightly-corseted grandmother of Gilmore conducts a seance with her son and his fiance in which Gilmore is conceived to the buzzing of thousands of bees. That Gilmore was the first person to be executed in the United Sates after the reinstitution of the death penalty also contributes to the complex martyrdom (political and moral) with which both Barney and Mailer surround his death.</td>
