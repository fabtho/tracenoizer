 More importantly, Gilmore refused the appeals process, demanding the right to die -- "blood atonement" in Morman doctrine -- for his sins. As Barney noted on Sunday in the Q and A period following the showing of Cremaster 5, the film he released just prior to 2, only people who are interested in or curious about his movies will come to see them anyway. 612-375-7650 In fact, one could argue that suggesting the film is "based" on Mailer's book is misleading. Certainly those who seek out Barney's film because they are interested in Gilmore's life will be disappointed. In no way can Cremaster 2 be described as a portrait of Gary Gilmore.</td>

 . In this installment of the Cremaster cycle, an elliptical narrative unfolds around the film's anti-hero, convicted killer Gary Gilmore, who is played by Barney himself. Loosely based on the life of Gilmore as chronicled by Norman Mailer in his book The Executioner's Song, the film moves from a glacier field in the Canadian Rockies to the Bonneville Salt Flats, from Utah in 1976 to Chicago in 1893. Featured in the cast of Cremaster 2 are Mailer and Dave Lombardo, former lead drummer for the band Slayer. Composer Jonathan Bepler provides an original musical score for the film, with vocals by Steve Tucker of Morbid Angel and Patty Griffin.</td>
