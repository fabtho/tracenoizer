 " Barney himself will show up at the Nuart to introduce the film on February 19. . A series of five films exploring themes of confinement, transformation and freedom, the Cremaster films are baroque in appearance, primal in tone and impossibly complex. The film also features synchronized equestrian maneuvers staged at the Bonneville Salt Flats at Wendover, Utah; an 1893 performance in Chicago by Houdini; the taming of a Brahma bull; an actor portraying Johnny Cash, who supposedly telephoned Gilmore shortly before his execution; and a virtual Mormon Tabernacle Choir. The films have been shot out of sequence, and Cremaster 2 was actually the fourth completed.</td>

 This intermingling of sports and art informs his work as a sculptor and filmmaker. After graduating from Yale in 1991, Barney entered the art world to almost instant controversy and success. The title of the films refers to the muscle that raises and lowers the male reproductive system according to temperature, external stimulation, or fear. The films themselves are a grand mixture of history, autobiography, and mythology, an intensely private universe in which symbols and images are densely layered and interconnected. The resulting cosmology is both beautiful and complex.</td>
