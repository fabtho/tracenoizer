 While the importance of differential geometry in the control of PDE and inverse problems has been established, there has never been a concerted effort to bring geometers to interact with experts in these other areas. The workshop goals are to bring together geometers with researchers in inverse problems and control of PDE to facilitate exchange of ideas and encourage collaboration; to make tools of differential geometry known to those working in inverse problems and control, and to open new areas of research in geometry. The workshop will for instance explore the use of inverse problem- and control methods to rigidity problems in geometry. We are planning a 2-week workshop in which Week 1 will emphasize the Geometric and PDE methods and Week 2 will focus on applications of these techniques to inverse and control problems. Both weeks will begin with overview talks designed to set the stage for the workshop.</td>

 I also found Accelerate Your Mac's pages on IDE drives useful, especially the Drive Compatibility Database. The moral of the story is that even if you're not all that technically savvy, you can perform a number of basic repairs yourself. For instance, check out the 6400 Zone's Upgrade Experiences and Reader Reviews pages. Similar information is available for other Mac models - the hard part is finding it, since most of the search terms are generic words or numbers. They've fixed a number of problems for me over the years, though my most telling story about the quality of Westwind's service involves a problem they fixed without repairing anything.</td>
