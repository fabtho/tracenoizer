 In addition to a healthy swing, our friendly instructors make sure students understand basic rules, scoring, etiquette and even the lingo. We provide a positive learning environment where students can learn at their own pace, while enjoying the camaraderie and support or other students at their skill level. There are three programs designed to meet the skill level for each person. Tee It Up 1 is a comprehensive program that teaches students golfing fundamentals and prepares them to navigate the course. At Nike Golf Learning Centers, our unique programs feature Nike Golf teaching professionals actually playing the course with students.</td>

 The workshop will for instance explore the use of inverse problem- and control methods to rigidity problems in geometry. We are planning a 2-week workshop in which Week 1 will emphasize the Geometric and PDE methods and Week 2 will focus on applications of these techniques to inverse and control problems. Both weeks will begin with overview talks designed to set the stage for the workshop. The presence of several talks of a survey nature will make this workshop an ideal venue for young researcher wanting to get involved in these fields. The format of the workshop will consist in invited talks (both of a survey and of a more specialized nature), two sessions of contributed talks and a panel discussion.</td>

This can happen when improperly cured woods are used or if the wood has internal stress that remains in the wood like long memory; if this happens on a DM humidor, we will replace or repair it at any point, as I feel it is a manufacturing oversight. It happens rarely, but does happen, even to the most experienced humidor makers.</td>
