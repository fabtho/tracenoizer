 Instead, the issue of approximate controllability and strong stabilizability are related to unique continuation properties. These areas have recently seen the use of differential geometric methods to solve some outstanding questions in those fields. As an example, a combination of unique continuation results with the boundary control method has lead to the solution of the inverse problem of determining a metric of a Riemannian manifold (with boundary) from the dynamic Dirichlet-to-Neumann map associated with the wave equation. A natural question to ask if one can determine the metric from this data alone ; this question is at the center of the boundary rigidity problem studied in Riemannian geometry. There are also interesting inverse problems for semilinear elliptic partial differential equations where the uniqueness issue is intimately tied with the geometry of the domain.</td>
