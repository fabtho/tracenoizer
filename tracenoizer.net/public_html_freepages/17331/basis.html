Growth factor signal transduction in endothelial cells appears to be critical in these processes. We have isolated and characterized several novel growth factors and receptors of endothelial and hematopoietic cells and aim to inhibit or stimulate angiogenesis on basis of their signalling properties. We also explore related aspects of endothelial cell biology, such as the role of apoptosis in angiogenesis and vessel remodelling and endothelial cell-specific gene control elements and gene expression using some of the molecular tools we have generated. Of particular interest are mechanisms of lymphatic vascular growth or lymphanigiogenesis and its involvement in tumor metastasis.">
