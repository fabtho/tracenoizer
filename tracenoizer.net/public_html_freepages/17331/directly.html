 As a result, the study forecasts that one third of Web vendors will outsource their shipping to third-party merchandise suppliers, Internet-based fulfillment networks and drop shippers over the next year. Using third parties is expected to help e-tailers in their quest to slash labor expenditures, speed processing times and lower inventory overhead. Boosting Efficiency In order to automate the drop shipping process, e-tailers must use Internet fulfillment networks to directly connect them with manufacturing and distribution partners, Jupiter said. These private trading hubs would allow marketers to boost their supply chain efficiency and improve customer service by overseeing order routing, monitoring performance and conducting real-time inventory checks. "Merchants that deal with numerous drop-shipping suppliers are finding that fulfillment nets offer huge advantages over the traditional and widespread use of telephone and the fax," said Schatsky.</td>
