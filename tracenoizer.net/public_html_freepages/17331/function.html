 You don't need to set a version if you are using the current version of Qt. In order to accommodate new functionality, the datastream serialization format of some Qt classes has changed in some versions of Qt. If you want to read data that was created by an earlier version of Qt, or write data that can be read by a program that was compiled with an earlier version of Qt, use this function to modify the serialization format of QDataStream. The len is serialized as a Q_UINT32, followed by len bytes from s. .</td>
