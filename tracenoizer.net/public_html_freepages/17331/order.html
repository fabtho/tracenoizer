<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" "Online retailers should not be too quick to celebrate the increased rate of online gift shopping in 2000," said Mary Brett Whitfield, director of PricewaterhouseCoopers' E-Retail Intelligence System. "Getting online gift shoppers to return in the New Year is crucial to their success. " PwC's findings were supported by a separate study released Monday by Accenture (formerly Andersen Consulting), which found that despite efforts to improve e-tailer order fulfillment over the holidays, as many as 67 percent of e-tail deliveries were not received as ordered, and 12 percent were not received in time for the Christmas holiday. Can't Get No Satisfaction Among this year's holiday online purchasers, 79 percent reported being completely satisfied (down 3 percent from 1999), while 21 percent reported being somewhat satisfied. Less than 1 percent of Net shoppers reported being entirely unsatisfied with the online shopping experience.">

 As a result, the study forecasts that one third of Web vendors will outsource their shipping to third-party merchandise suppliers, Internet-based fulfillment networks and drop shippers over the next year. Using third parties is expected to help e-tailers in their quest to slash labor expenditures, speed processing times and lower inventory overhead. Boosting Efficiency In order to automate the drop shipping process, e-tailers must use Internet fulfillment networks to directly connect them with manufacturing and distribution partners, Jupiter said. These private trading hubs would allow marketers to boost their supply chain efficiency and improve customer service by overseeing order routing, monitoring performance and conducting real-time inventory checks. "Merchants that deal with numerous drop-shipping suppliers are finding that fulfillment nets offer huge advantages over the traditional and widespread use of telephone and the fax," said Schatsky.</td>

 In fact, in current data modeling languages, the distinction between data modeling layers is blurred. Many standards like UML or XML Schema attempt to capture as many features as possible, reaching from the definition of syntactic elements to aggregation, class partitions, ontology languages etc. Using a layered approach sketched above, interoperation between data models can be simplified by an order of magnitude. Indeed, if every layer has m implementation options, only O(m2) mappings within a given layer are required in worst case. For n layers, this yields O(nm2) mappings, compared to O(m2n).</td>
