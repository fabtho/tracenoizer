There may be no more important work being done to ensure a quality future for all. Where city-level data was unavailable in 1990, but was available in 1998, we only used county or state data to compute the change in health over those eight years. Although we did not include this category in the cities' final grades and ranks, it is an important indication of both positive and negative changes taking place. Consider this an "effort" grade, much like the "effort" grades given to our students in their report cards.">

 The US GenWeb Project The World GenWeb Project The Internet Genealogical Directory RootsWeb . . As my own research has continued, as new findings are published, and as more people add their data, the files have grown and grown. This web site has now become a compilation of the original data contained in my personal family tree with that of many contributors (both individual and published). If you are researching any of the surnames presented here, I hope you will find data to help you in your quest.</td>

 The len is serialized as a Q_UINT32, followed by len bytes from s. . Functions QDataStream Class Reference The QDataStream class provides serialization of binary data to a QIODevice. For example a data stream that is written by a PC under Windows can be read by a Sun SPARC running Solaris. If you want a "parsing" input stream, see QTextStream.</td>
