 The intent of OSHA is to make the work site a safer place in which to work. By making operators more aware of conditions which require their attention to detail, the cost in terms of damage to equipment, material and lost-time injuries can be reduced by placing proper attention to operator training. This program represents a win-win opportunity to all involved. Order your training kit today, using the order forms. .</td>

 Online shoppers also said they used the Internet to buy gifts because it saved them time, allowed them to research products more efficiently and featured items that were not available locally. Unfulfilled e-Shoppers However, shoppers became frustrated when they learned that desired merchandise was out of stock, when Web pages took too long to load and when desired products were not being offered online. The most persistent frustration for online holiday shoppers in 2000, according to the study, involved order fulfillment, the same issue that plagued many major e-tailers in 1999. The study reported that consumers were frustrated when they did not receive adequate e-mails about the status of their orders, as well as when they were asked to pay extra fees to ensure that orders would arrive on time. Whitfield told the E-Commerce Times that the PwC and Accenture studies differ because PwC looked at whether or not customers were satisfied while Accenture measured whether or not e-tailers met rigid criteria set by researchers.</td>

 However, VEGFR-3 is also induced in blood vessels of various types of human cancer. Ongoing experiments will address the role of the VEGFR-3 signaling pathway in embryonic and tumor angiogenesis and the mechanisms of lymphatic metastasis. The discovered molecules may allow the regulation of angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis as well as inhibition of tumor metastasis and tissue edema involved in many diseases. To define the functions of the VEGF-B, VEGF-C, VEGF-D growth factors and the VEGFR-3 receptor and their potential uses in diseases. To define the molecular mechanisms of lymphatic metastasis of cancer and possibilities of its inhibition.</td>
