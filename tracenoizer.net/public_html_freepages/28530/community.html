 Data monitoring is performed on a routine basis by the IGOSS Operations Co-ordinator and a series of Data Monitoring and Statistical Reports are available by FTP and via e-mail on the internet. IGOSS products are disseminated promptly through the GTS and by radio, radio facsimile, and various electronic and hard copy mail systems. The IGOSS Products Bulletin, established in 1991, compiles and publishes IGOSS global and regional products as a valuable service to the scientific community and international programmes. Previous and existing cooperation between the IGOSS community and several research programmes of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) such as TOGA, WOCE, and CLIVAR) has led to transitioning many of the functions of the SOOP and data monitoring to an operational mode. A low density eXpendable BathyThermograph (XBT) network, based on the scientific design of the the original TOGA-WOCE network, is becoming operational after the field acquisition phase of WOCE has concluded in 1997.</td>

 The mission must be client focused and expansive, recognizing that equal justice contemplates more than simply providing a lawyer in every family law or unlawful detainer case. The mission must contemplate lawyering in its broadest sense, acknowledging that the interests of low income clients can only be served if the delivery system is dedicated to providing full and complete access to the civil justice system in a way that empowers this segment of the population to define, promote and defend its legitimate interests. INSTITUTIONAL VALUES The mission suggests certain core institutional values that, in turn, drive operational decisions that must be made by the larger equal justice community in reconstructing the civil legal services delivery system. The civil legal services delivery system must have the capacity to regularly and effectively identify the most pressing legal needs of low income clients and identifiable client constituencies in consultation with the low income client community, and the corresponding commitment to deploy resources in a manner that maximizes the system's ability to effectively respond to those most pressing needs. The system must be designed to ensure real equality of access to justice.</td>
