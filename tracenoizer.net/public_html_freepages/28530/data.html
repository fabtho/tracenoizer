 The SECTION parameter is not used if a SCUBA section was given via the IN parameter. . Once the data specification has been decoded the application will read from parameter VALUE the value of the data that should be used. All data specified by the section (or by the inverse of this section if specified) will be set to this value. If "Quality" is specified, then the quality values are treated as numerical values (in the range 0 to 255).</td>

 Tribal Directories, maps, moreNational Income Standards Calculation Utility contents (home page) . . Progeny Canada Tribal Data Resources (TDR) has focused its efforts on providing tribes and tribal service organizations with the tools and training necessary to increase their self-sufficiency and administrative resources in these times of reduced federal funding and increased competition. As the TDR demographics and needs assessment process has proven to be a very useful and effective tool in Tribal data management, we find that all Native American organizations benefit from our unique and comprehensive reporting and mapping process which is utilized in required reporting and funding applications. This information will allow us to quickly and accurately access data regarding housing status, income, employment, and education.</td>
