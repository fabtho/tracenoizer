 Enhanced transparency in disclosures, the chamber notes, is reflective of good corporate governance and gives credibility to banks' financial statements. In any effective system of corporate governance in the financial sector, the board of directors would have to devise relevant strategies and be fully responsible for the working of the organisation ASSOCHAM said the board of directors should be subject to a considerable degree of accountability, suppression of facts or misinformation should be made a criminal offence. To ensure that unsuitable persons are not on the boards of banks, it is not necessary to take away the voting rights of shareholders. ASSOCHAM said for good corporate governance in the financial sector, the depositor, as a stakeholder, should get precedence over the shareholder who has much less at stake in a bank. Further, the chamber points out that the legislative framework should be made more flexible to give the regulatory-supervisory authority sufficient powers to adequately deal with rapid financial innovations.</td>

 1, 1991, Schoeller-Bleckmann Edelstahlrohr GmbH (SBER) has operated independently. Privatization of the company took place at the beginning of 1995. This motto was adopted by a team of experienced executives who, in order to ensure the long-term future of SBER, took over the company through a management buyout. From the beginning the new owners have been committed to a clear and successful strategy based on offering customers a high level of flexibility, first class service, the highest quality standards, and absolute responsibility. These objectives have resulted in the creation of a competitive company of optimal size.</td>

 We have seen far too many development staff members say, "It's not my job. " With everyone running around strictly adhering to their own job description, sometimes even setting artificial boundaries about where their job ends and someone else's begins, it's hardly surprising that software gets built poorly. Ensure that everyone understands the big picture, the vision and purpose of the project and of the organization. Educate staff on the interdependencies in the process - i. how some departments depend on high quality work coming from other departments.</td>
