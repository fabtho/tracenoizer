Progeny Canada Tribal Data Resources (TDR) has focused its efforts on providing tribes and tribal service organizations with the tools and training necessary to increase their self-sufficiency and administrative resources in these times of reduced federal funding and increased competition. As the TDR demographics and needs assessment process has proven to be a very useful and effective tool in Tribal data management, we find that all Native American organizations benefit from our unique and comprehensive reporting and mapping process which is utilized in required reporting and funding applications. This information will allow us to quickly and accurately access data regarding housing status, income, employment, and education. TDR has effectively developed a highly technical system that is user friendly and applicable specifically to Indian Country.">

 " With everyone running around strictly adhering to their own job description, sometimes even setting artificial boundaries about where their job ends and someone else's begins, it's hardly surprising that software gets built poorly. Ensure that everyone understands the big picture, the vision and purpose of the project and of the organization. Educate staff on the interdependencies in the process - i. how some departments depend on high quality work coming from other departments. After explaining the vision and purpose, if you still have hold-outs saying, "It's not my job," show them the door.</td>

 What and how the system will work in the future are not simple questions to answer. Ultimately the answers to the logistical and operational questions are driven by the values and philosophies of those charged with planning for the future. The purpose of this paper is to provide a framework against which this planning process might proceed. It articulates a mission that is driven by a vision of equal justice that empowers low income individuals and groups to define, promote and defend their legitimate interests through the civil justice system. The paper then identifies certain institutional values that flow naturally from the mission statement and which, in turn, lead to the identification of certain core operational capacities essential to any future organizational structures or service delivery configurations.</td>
