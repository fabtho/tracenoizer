It articulates a mission that is driven by a vision of equal justice that empowers low income individuals and groups to define, promote and defend their legitimate interests through the civil justice system.

The goal is not to define the outcome in terms of specific organizational identities, relative responsibilities, and resource allocations, but instead to define a philosophical and values driven superstructure around which the operational decisions must be made.

 Tribal Directories, maps, moreNational Income Standards Calculation Utility contents (home page) . . Progeny Canada Tribal Data Resources (TDR) has focused its efforts on providing tribes and tribal service organizations with the tools and training necessary to increase their self-sufficiency and administrative resources in these times of reduced federal funding and increased competition. As the TDR demographics and needs assessment process has proven to be a very useful and effective tool in Tribal data management, we find that all Native American organizations benefit from our unique and comprehensive reporting and mapping process which is utilized in required reporting and funding applications. This information will allow us to quickly and accurately access data regarding housing status, income, employment, and education.</td>

 Privatization of the company took place at the beginning of 1995. This motto was adopted by a team of experienced executives who, in order to ensure the long-term future of SBER, took over the company through a management buyout. From the beginning the new owners have been committed to a clear and successful strategy based on offering customers a high level of flexibility, first class service, the highest quality standards, and absolute responsibility. These objectives have resulted in the creation of a competitive company of optimal size. It is both small enough to react quickly and flexibly to the rapidly changing international market, and large enough to meet specific customer needs as effectively as possible.</td>
