 My first goal was to connect a microcontroller to one of the serial ports and connect a GPS receiver, LCD display, and IR decoder (for infrared remote control). This was actually surprsingly easy to do since all three are devices that use simple serial communications. The first design simply took any data from the host (CPU) and sent it to the LCD display, and took data from both the GPS and IR decoder and sent them to the CPU (with some simple protocol codes to distinguish data types). Although this was simple it proved to be quite powerful. All of these devices are connected to a single RS232 port and sharing the low band width (19200 baud) connection with the CPU.</td>

 . We need to know the rules for representing an integer, string, or floating point number in a SOAP message so that we can exchange messages freely between languages and platforms. The serialization of data inside a SOAP message is referred to as encoding. As this section focuses on the payload of the message, the XML in the examples represents only a SOAP message payload and not a complete message. Encoding Style The ability to decide on a set of rules for representing data in a message is very important to the open nature of SOAP.</td>
