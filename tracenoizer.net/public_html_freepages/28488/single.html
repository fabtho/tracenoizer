 STS's Advanced Silicon Etch (ASE) process is the market leader for anisotropic etching of silicon for Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) fablication. The multiplex series is a unique range of load-locked systems for precision thin film etching and deposition. The systems are available in a range of process modules in either single chamber or cluster tool format. The fully automatic wafer transfer system can handle wafers up to 200mm or batches of various shapes and sizes. The powerful industry standard PC control allows the necessary flexibility in both system configuration and operation.</td>

 But this left me with no free ports for adding sensors or other devices. 2k baud, most of the devices I want to interface only require a measly 9600 baud. I therefore decided to use microcontrollers to multiplex multiple devices on a single RS233 serial port. This has proved to be an interesting and powerful distributed approach. My first goal was to connect a microcontroller to one of the serial ports and connect a GPS receiver, LCD display, and IR decoder (for infrared remote control).</td>

 Although we can have encoding without a corresponding schema, it's not recommended. Most XML parsers will soon be schema-aware (in fact, some like Xerces already are), and we can save ourselves a lot of trouble when parsing messages if we rely on the parser and schema to validate and convert data instead of doing it manually. SOAP Encoding The SOAP Specification defines a single set of encoding rules that are referred to as SOAP encoding. SOAP encoding is based on XML Schemas and as such it closely models many of the standard types and constructs that developers would be familiar with. .</td>
