 2k baud, most of the devices I want to interface only require a measly 9600 baud. I therefore decided to use microcontrollers to multiplex multiple devices on a single RS233 serial port. This has proved to be an interesting and powerful distributed approach. My first goal was to connect a microcontroller to one of the serial ports and connect a GPS receiver, LCD display, and IR decoder (for infrared remote control). This was actually surprsingly easy to do since all three are devices that use simple serial communications.</td>
