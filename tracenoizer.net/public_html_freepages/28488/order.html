 Be sure you have entered your correct email address in the space at the top of the form. YOU SHOULD, THEREFORE, CAREFULLY CONSIDER WHETHER SUCH TRADING IS SUITABLE FOR YOU IN LIGHT OF YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES. If the market moves against your position, you may be called upon by your broker to deposit a substantial amount of additional margin funds, on short notice, in order to maintain your position. If you do not provide the required funds within the time required by your broker, your position may be liquidated at a loss, and you will be liable for any resulting deficit in your account. (2) Under certain market conditions, you may find it difficult or impossible to liquidate a position.</td>

 To use this feature, you need a command line recall buffer size greater than 0. By default the buffer size is 1024 bytes, and the maximum number of entries in the buffer is 32. Enabling Read Line Recall and Editing Just as you do for command line recall, you need a command line recall buffer size greater than 0 in order to use read line recall. You can enable read line recall using the Language panel of the System Configuration editor. Read line recall must be enabled for the device being opened or used, with the R protocol.</td>
