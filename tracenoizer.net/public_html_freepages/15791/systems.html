 Often similar methods are used without the inclusion of experience from related disciplines. . (2001) Integrative Systems Approaches to Natural and Social Dynamics. Impetus was received from the investigation of the non-linear dynamics of complex systems, which occur in physical, chemical but also ecological and social systems. Theoretical systems science investigates the endogenous structure and the exogenous influences which effect the stabilisation, self-organisation, adaptation and emergence, etc.</td>

 . Its history dates back to the 1940's and 1950's when thinkers such as Wiener, von Bertalanffy, Ashby and von Foerster founded the domain through a series of interdisciplinary meetings. Systems theory or systems science argues that however complex or diverse the world that we experience, we will always find different types of organization in it, and such organization can be described by concepts and principles which are independent from the specific domain at which we are looking. Hence, if we would uncover those general laws, we would be able to analyse and solve problems in any domain, pertaining to any type of system. The systems approach distinguishes itself from the more traditional analytic approach by emphasizing the interactions and connectedness of the different components of a system.</td>

com where you can take advantage of our new features such as KeyWord SARA and Favourites. Historically, highly analytic and numeric based methods have sufficed, frequently simplifying the problem to allow analytical tractability. Many manufactured and natural systems (biological, ecological and socio-economic) cannot be adequately represented quantitively alone; qualitations and heuristics, linguistics etc, knowledge is frequently required within a common information-processing framework. The primary aim of IJSS is to become world leader in the exciting and demanding field of intelligent systems engineering and its applications. .</td>
