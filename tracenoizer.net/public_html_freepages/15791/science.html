 This will facilitate comparative and interdisciplinary uses of the data, enable both non-specialists and China scholars to understand and utilize these data, and enhance knowledge of China. . A primary goal of the Center will be the integration of historical, social and natural science data in a geographic information system, where spatial and temporal references will be maintained through a relational database. This will facilitate comparative and interdisciplinary uses of the data, enable both non-specialists and China scholars to understand and utilize these data, and enhance knowledge of China. .</td>
