 Search current jobs in the Intel China Research Center. . The center will focus on applied research for information technology in the areas of Internet, speech and intelligent human-computer interactions. A vision of the Center is to realize "intelligent, listening and talking computers" in the future. The research team in Beijing will work closely with speech researchers worldwide to help incorporate speech technologies in future software applications.</td>

 The Center facilitates interdisciplinary and cooperative research, graduate education and public service programs in systems science, applied mathematics and computation throughout the University. The Center offices are housed in a suite in the multidisciplinary Goldwater Center adjoining the offices of faculty from various areas of engineering and mathematics. Faculty and Staff Over 100 faculty from science, engineering, and technology departments at ASU are affiliated with the SSERC. The SSERC participates in the DARPA ANIC grant to study Advanced Neural Implants and Control. Computing Facilities The SSERC Computation and Visualization Lab comprises an array of HP multiprocessor devices and visualization facilities.</td>

 About 20 of the institutions will become technological firms, with the rest expected to turn into intermediate service agencies or merge with enterprises or universities. . Tuesday's China Daily quoted sources close to the Ministry of Science and Technology as saying that the reform means some 100 research institutions, which are affiliated to four ministerial-level departments, now have to be self-supporting rather than relying on central funding. China has made it a point that large national scientific projects will be implemented via open bids rather than government designation. "The move is to further accelerate the reform of scientific systems to build a powerful and creative research team," said Zhu Chuanbo, an official with the ministry.</td>
