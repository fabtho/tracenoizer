 The reputable and time honored PIMS database at Princeton University clearly demonstrates that businesses rated high by their customers for service grow faster and are more profitable than businesses rated low. The American Customer Satisfaction Index (University of Michigan Business School) stood at 74 in 1994, dipped to 71 in 1997 and has only slowly recovered to 73 in 2000. Only one in three customers who have a problem and contact the organization for help are satisfied with the response they get. Bold promises are often made - bad results are often the reality. The real issue is that the promised and necessary great services are harder to deliver than ever.</td>
