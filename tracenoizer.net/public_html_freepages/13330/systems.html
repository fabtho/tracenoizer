 The facility should not be used for commercial gain. Specified security features must be installed (ident, keeping log files, etc. The postmaster must respond to complaints in a manner that is consistent with University policy and with that of other systems administrators on campus. Accounts must be limited to only registered Carleton students. Accounts must be deleted when students are no longer registered.</td>

WHITE PSE Milepost Run-Time Systems Performance Tests White PSE Milepost Run-Time Systems Performance Tests The Accelerated Strategic Computing Initiative (ASCI) Problem Solving Environment (PSE) consists of the tools and libraries needed for the development of ASCI simulation codes on ASCI machines. The recently completed ASCI PSE Milepost demonstrated that this software environment is available and functional at the scale used for application mileposts on ASCI White. This demonstration allows the ASCI code developers to focus on application development.</td>
