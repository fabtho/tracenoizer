 The publication in 1983 of Crispin Wright's Frege's Conception of Numbers as Objects (FCNO), marked the start of a period of active reappraisal of Frege's attempt. Wright argued that, at least as far as number-theory (the theory of the finite cardinals) is concerned, important formal and philosophical insights can be salvaged from the wreckage of Frege's account. In view of the increasing interest in the main philosophical ideas in FCNO and growing recognition of their technical potential, we now launch a five-year collaborative project to explore the prospects of extending the neo-Fregean approach to real and functional analysis and to classical set theory, and to examine its philosophical significance and problems in greater depth. The neo-Fregean thesis about arithmetic is that knowledge of the basic arithmetical laws (essentially, the Dedekind-Peano axioms)-and hence of the existence of a range of objects which satisfy them-may be based a priori on "Hume's principle", that (informally) The number of F's is the same as the number of G's just if the F's and G's can be put into one-to-one correspondence. Claims (i) and (iii) concern the epistemology of the meaning of arithmetical statements, while (ii) and (iv) concern the recognition of their truth.</td>

 I guess that was a 'plot twist,' but somehow, it made the way the movie fell together more irritating in this instance (I won't deny it's a tactic that works elsewhere. It amazing that Duvall is even in this morning - the lines he has to deliver are so far below his calibar that even he has trouble portraying anything other than a cartoon chracter in this SF 'thriller. However, he is no longer satisfied with the real world as he is compelled to answer the questions, "What is The Matrix. However, the opening scene dialogue between a cop and an 'Agent' clues you in pretty quickly that the acting is not going to be one of the stronger points of this movie. In fact, at the end of it, you realise that on a comparative scale, Keanu Reeves stands out as Oscar material in this film.</td>

 Neo is in many ways more imaginative than the other IALs cited, so there are a lot of ideas here. Neo texts are much shorter than their English equivalents. There may be some flaws in all this brevity, but some seems quite real. The novelty is sometimes dubious, but rather interesting. Now, I don't believe the Neo project would ever have succeeded, but it has many imaginative things to contribute.</td>
