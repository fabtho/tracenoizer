This creative adaptation of Roman ideas and tactics, according to Bachrach, was the key to Fulk's successful consolidation of political power. Students of medieval and military history will find here a colorful, impressively researched biography. Bachrach is Professor of History at the University of Minnesota and fellow of the Medieval Academy of America. His previous books include Early Medieval Jewish Policy in Western Europe (1977).</td>

The Luddite movement was a watershed event at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. The Industrial Revolution was a fascinating period that brought about profound changes in the human condition.</td>

Boot is so enamored of imperial history, perhaps we should take a tour through the region and see exactly what American involvement in Southwest Asia has so far wrought. America's first significant postwar maneuver in the region happened in 1953. Boot's Cold War exigencies; Mossadegh was making nice with the Reds.</td>
