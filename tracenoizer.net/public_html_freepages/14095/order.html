 Rather than claiming that his group was the descendants of the early Rosicrucian brethren, Heindel applied the term "Fellowship" to signify that they were rather inspirated by the original brotherhood. Nevertheless, he maintained a story about a personal initiation, which allegedly took place on a mountain in Germany. Heindel postulated further that the RF should prepare the coming of the true and original order. Their periodical is called "Rays from the Rosy Cross". RF has also been a publisher of several books, including the works of Heindel, and his Magnum Opus called "The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception".</td>

 An abstraction says nothing about the truth-conditions of identity statements in which only one of the related terms is of the kind it concerns. ) Does this mean that such principles fail to fix any distinction between the abstracts they introduce and things of other sorts and hence do not genuinely explain what sort of things those abstracts are. The first-order variables occurring in the second-order definition of "F is one-to-one corespondent to G" must range over numbers if Hume's principle is to provide a proof of the infinity of the number series. Some commentators have worried that this makes the principle explanatorily circular. Some abstractions-axiom V of Frege's own historic system is the classic example-are logically inconsistent.</td>
