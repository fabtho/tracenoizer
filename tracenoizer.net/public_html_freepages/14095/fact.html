 . A short play involving one of the performers standing on an American flag and saying the pledge of allegiance Description of incident Censored by the hosting theater because they were afraid that the theater would be shut down or a protest would occur. Results of incident The specific piece was pulled from performance only due to the fact that the performer was tired of doing it and not due to the theater's insistence.

 You may use the Observers Comment to report failed or successful attempts to observe these objects. It is possible that some of the objects listed here are comets, either recognised or currently unrecognised as such. If you detect cometary features in any of these objects, please report this fact. We do not flag suspected comets on this page because we do not wish to influence observers. You are reminded that a cross-reference of designations that have appeared here previously is given further down this page.</td>
