 The console is essentially a beautiful 2D gaming masterpiece. You just cannot experience a video game anything like the one's that have been produced for the Neo Geo hardware. We encourage all Neo Geo fans out there to help us with the development of this project, because without your help we cannot produce an exciting and resourceful website. Feel free to send us your favorite artwork to us and we will display it on the site. Also purchase rare Neo Geo CD games from the online shop and keep in contact with fellow Neo CD gamers in the online discussion forum.</td>

 At its worst, it can be a tool in the hands of data analysts who strive to prove their points, while disguising their attempts by appealing to the authority of factor-analysis as an objective technique. In the following section, I present a brief summary of some potential problems inherent in the factor-analytic technique. I point to several arbitrary decisions during the development of the NEO FFM which have influenced its present form. The method of factor-analysis has a number of inherent features which make it less than a purely objective method. First, loss of information may result from the fact that factor-analysis works on bivariate linear correlations, and is thus insensitive to non-linear relationships.</td>
