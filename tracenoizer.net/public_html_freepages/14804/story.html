 84ADD TO CART 2 10 to the 16 to 1 by James Patrick Kelly A small boy struggling in the thick of the Cold War is thrown into the middle of the struggle to preserve humanity. ) It's been six years since the alien dog-creatures arrived and began eating tunnels into the earth at five remote locations around the globe--and now a conservative exobiologist joins an eccentric billionaire on his project to discover the secret of the crystals mysteriously forming on top of their offensive waste piles. 20ADD TO CART 4 Breakaway, Backdown by James Patrick Kelly This story presents a gritty, realistic view of what the real consequences may be of people occupying space for long periods of time. It's written in an unusual second-person style in which you, the reader, take the role of a shoe-sales person talking with a person who has just dropped out of the orbital space culture. The main character talks directly to the reader, and the story is written such that you will automatically fill in the other side of the conversation.</td>

 I put my life in peril four times for the sake of the Empire. Lloyd George and its appreciation by you, and the condonation of the Punjab atrocities, have completely shattered my faith in the good intentions of Government and the nation which is supporting it.
