 This is a session default and as such this information will be preserved in the . . If subpixel interpolation is specified the user must specify a file of the point spread function model of the sensor. It is recommended that if you are using this command to turn off the gas gauge, to turn it back on at the end of the script so that gas gauge will be present when the user performs operations interactively.

 Correct flush handling of a pipe or FIFO with modules pushed is achieved via the pipemod module. This module should be the first module pushed onto a pipe so that it is at the midpoint of the pipe itself. I_SETSIG Informs the STREAM head that the user wishes the kernel to issue the SIGPOLL signal (see signal(3C) ) when a particular event has occurred on the STREAM associated with fildes. I_SETSIG supports an asynchronous processing capability in STREAMS. The value of arg is a bitmask that specifies the events for which the user should be signaled.</td>

 I am actually writing a book on the subject, so this page is connected with the OFM book. The importance of this type of file managers is based on a very high productivity of advanced users and the portability (the OFM is the most portable file manager known to the author; Xtree is also available on several platforms, but not that many). To the uninitiated it often looks like a magic -- the speed with which an advanced user can perform complex file operations. They are an essential (and underutilised) tool for system administrators, especially UNIX system administrators. But generally for X-windows the optimal implementation should be based on a scripting language and some OFM managers based of TCL already are available.</td>
