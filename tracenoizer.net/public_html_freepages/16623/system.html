 PROPAGATION OF COST UNCERTAINTY To mathematically describe the propagation of uncertainty in a system-of-systems, consider the relative uncertainty in the total cost CT of the entire system-of-systems ensemble. . Analyzing Costs of System-of-Systems Analyzing the Costs of System-of-Systems Year 2000 Problem Resolution John A. org ABSTRACT A major management challenge faced by every private and governmental organization is how to estimate the cost of fixing the Year 2000 date problem in interconnected systems. Up-front systems cost analyses for Year 2000 problem resolution must be sufficiently detailed for effective resource allocation and funding justification.</td>

 Enter (either manually or via Browse button) the path name to where CRT is installed into Telnet Application box. CRT allows you select your keyboard mapping separate from the emulation. This setting is either the initial value or could have been changed by the remote system sending an escape sequence to change the mode. 4, the initial "New Line Mode" setting can be set by editing the session from the connect dialog. 0, the initial "New Line Mode" setting can be set by clicking the "Advanced" button on the emulation tab of the Session Preferences dialog.</td>
