 Indeed, this is the umpteenth proposal that would break compliance with the existing defacto USENET digest format and archiver format. Lest you feel that breaking compliance is a small matter, I should remind you that these formats are far wider supported than any other more modern "gimick" - almost every news reader, for example, supports the USENET digest format. Indeed, the standard FAQL format as proposed would probably also break all of the automated FAQ archivers too. We went through something like this with Thomas Fine some time ago. We at least need a document to describe the method already in use that's reasonably common.</td>

 When a self-extracting Zip file created by WinZip Self-Extractor is run, a dialog box is displayed.

What are the advantages to Self-Extracting Zip Files.
