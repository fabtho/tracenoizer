 PROPAGATION OF COST UNCERTAINTY To mathematically describe the propagation of uncertainty in a system-of-systems, consider the relative uncertainty in the total cost CT of the entire system-of-systems ensemble. .org ABSTRACT A major management challenge faced by every private and governmental organization is how to estimate the cost of fixing the Year 2000 date problem in interconnected systems. Up-front systems cost analyses for Year 2000 problem resolution must be sufficiently detailed for effective resource allocation and funding justification. The framework includes a cost database, a cost model, and a process for collecting data.</td>

 The data required for a local housing strategy will be both quantitative and qualitative. Qualtitative data adds meaning and can aid interpretation of quantitative data. They are complementary and in combination, these two types of data can be used to uncover root causes of problems within housing systems. Good practice examples of how data might be combined to look at specific housing problems and issues are available. In some cases data will have to be collected because it does not exist in any readily accessible form.</td>

 org (external link) There is a German site similar to this one at www. FidoNet is an amateur electronic mail network with over 15,000 mail nodes world wide. Most mail nodes are publicly accessible Bulletin Board Systems (BBS), some of which have hundreds of members. Before Internet access became commonplace, FidoNet probably ranked up there alongside some of the better known commercial on-line services in terms of the number of people who used it. FidoNet nodes are often personal computers in somebody's basement; the system operator (sysop) may be a young child or a retired grandfather.</td>
