 They are complementary and in combination, these two types of data can be used to uncover root causes of problems within housing systems. Good practice examples of how data might be combined to look at specific housing problems and issues are available. In some cases data will have to be collected because it does not exist in any readily accessible form. Alternatively, it may require reviewing the way in which information internal to the authority is held. Examples of data collected for other purposes which may be relevant and will not necessarily entail major primary data collection exercises are given on the next page.</td>

 GOTS could include items already in the government inventory that are supplied as GFE or GFI , as arranged by changes to current contracts or by a memorandum of agreement (MOA) between the programs that are parties to the transfer of assets. Updates and modifications to GFE GOTS can also be arranged through additional purchases as needed. 2 ACQUISITION STRATEGY ISSUES In many cases it will be possible to use the existing maintenance organizations to fix the Year 2000 software errors. The cost of making software fixes in this case is likely to be consistent with historical software productivity rates experienced with recent maintenance releases. When Year 2000 fixes require tasks that go beyond what a maintenance contractor performs for an individual system, it becomes necessary to include additional renovation and implementation activities.</td>
