<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" " --Art critic Jerry Saltz New York-based artist Matthew Barney has become well known for the unique combination of obsessive athletic endeavors with his own highly personalized mythology. Crossing from sculpture to film to video, he seamlessly creates dramas of compelling, compulsive force that inhabit a zone between the psychological and the physical. In this exhibition, the Walker Art Center presents the world premiere of Matthew Barney's latest film, Cremaster 2. Loosely based on the life of Gilmore as chronicled by Norman Mailer in his book The Executioner's Song, the film moves from a glacier field in the Canadian Rockies to the Bonneville Salt Flats, from Utah in 1976 to Chicago in 1893. Featured in the cast of Cremaster 2 are Norman Mailer and Dave Lombardo, former lead drummer for the band Slayer.">

 The art of the Baroque is an art of excess, of encrusted, overloaded palace ceilings. Barney takes this overripe palatial aesthetic and makes it into an art for the 21st century. The cremaster is the muscle in the male genitals from which the testicles are suspended (and which retracts them in cold or fear). Barney's 'Cremaster' is a massively ambitious project centred on five films, of which four have been shown to date - Cremaster 4 in 1994, Cremaster 1 in 1995-96, Cremaster 5 in 1997 and Cremaster 2 in 1999. The entire series is to be exhibited at the Guggenheim, New York, in 2001.</td>
