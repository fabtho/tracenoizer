 Crossing from sculpture to film to video, he seamlessly creates dramas of compelling, compulsive force that inhabit a zone between the psychological and the physical. In this exhibition, the Walker Art Center presents the world premiere of Matthew Barneys latest film, Cremaster 2. n this installment of Barneys ongoing Cremaster cycle, an elliptical narrative unfolds around the films anti-hero, convicted killer Gary Gilmore, who is played by Barney himself. Loosely based on the life of Gilmore as chronicled by Norman Mailer in his book The Executioners Song, the film moves from a glacier field in the Canadian Rockies to the Bonneville Salt Flats, from Utah in 1976 to Chicago in 1893. Featured in the cast of Cremaster 2 are Norman Mailer and Dave Lombardo, former lead drummer for the band Slayer.</td>

 Barney takes this overripe palatial aesthetic and makes it into an art for the 21st century. The cremaster is the muscle in the male genitals from which the testicles are suspended (and which retracts them in cold or fear). Barney's 'Cremaster' is a massively ambitious project centred on five films, of which four have been shown to date - Cremaster 4 in 1994, Cremaster 1 in 1995-96, Cremaster 5 in 1997 and Cremaster 2 in 1999. The entire series is to be exhibited at the Guggenheim, New York, in 2001. Barney follows them up with objects, photographs and books that elaborate their imagery.</td>
