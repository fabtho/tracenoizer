 This film contains brief scenes of violent and sexual material. . In this installment of the Cremaster cycle, an elliptical narrative unfolds around the film's anti-hero, convicted killer Gary Gilmore, who is played by Barney himself. Loosely based on the life of Gilmore as chronicled by Norman Mailer in his book The Executioner's Song, the film moves from a glacier field in the Canadian Rockies to the Bonneville Salt Flats, from Utah in 1976 to Chicago in 1893. Featured in the cast of Cremaster 2 are Mailer and Dave Lombardo, former lead drummer for the band Slayer.</td>

 . This is an experimental project within the festival, dealing with film as it exists on the threshold of other disciplines. While the festival is running, from 27 January to 6 February, film installations will be on show in Boijmans Museum and Cremaster 2 by the american artist Matthew Barney will be exclusively shown on 5 and 6 February. Cremaster 2 is assuredly the most spectacular part on show in the 'Exploding Cinema' at the Boijmans Van Beuningen Museum. It forms the fourth part in a series of which already parts 4, 1 and 5 have been completed.</td>
