 They may cause you to think at great lengths about mysterious symbolic associations and meanings, but perceptually they are stillborn. . I remember thinking that this was some of the most interesting work I had seen in a while especially in the medium of video. It was hard to pin down in a art climate awash in politically charged work that seemed to shun with a vengeance poetry or ambiguity. I had not a clue as to what Barney was up to in these works, but it looked great and suggested some strange sexual tensions.</td>
