 After settling down in the East coast of Canada, Saint John New Brunswick, I received my BSc and MSc marine biology degrees from the University of New Brunswick. Mike Coates, Paul Scott, Paul Sammarco, and Terry Piva. Extracurricular activities include President of the Council of Postgraduate Students, Director of CQUSA, ballroom dancing, and scuba diving. With the opening of the Mackay CQU campus, I have been able to interview first year education students, as they will be the first to graduate here. I am enrolled full time, and have an interest in the completion and competencies of university students, including the structure of all support groups, such as student associations and mentoring.</td>
