This will meet forecast growth in labour force participation of parents with young children and substantially address current unmet demand. New service providers will benefit from the additional data that will be available from the National Childcare Information system. Under the current unrestricted growth, families may benefit in terms of competitive child care fees but competition has also had some disadvantages, including greater staff turnover, uncertainty about continuity of care and a very uneven distribution of new child care places across Australia. An ongoing supply limit would reduce competition and attract a premium to businesses which may be passed onto families through increased fees.">
