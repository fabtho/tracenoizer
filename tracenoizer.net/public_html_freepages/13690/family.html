 And yet recent stories about skyrocketing college tuitions and fees have included the fact that the more top-name universities jack up their fees, the more people clamor to get into them. To me, however, the college tuition spiral just plain stinks. Twenty years ago, no American family could have imagined spending literally the cost of a middle-class house on four years of beer-drinking, panty-raiding and occasional studying for Junior. If we save money by not hiring superfluous professors, we could double the pay of those poor, underpaid T. Besides, being based in a fun place like Key West, for example, would be a great way to attract students.</td>

 Rescuers today were expected to resume the search for a UA student who fell down an 80-foot waterfall at Reddington Pass Sunday when he jumped into the water to save his friend's dog. Searchers have spent the past two days using helicopters, mounted posses and probes to find Anton Bakker, an economics senior whose 22nd birthday is today. Bakker's friends and family were at the falls northeast of Tucson at sunrise yesterday, before rescuers arrived about 8 a. Brad Foust, a Pima County Sheriff's Department spokesman. Foust said a series of underwater shelves down river and intense currents due to recent snow and rain have made finding Bakker difficult.</td>
