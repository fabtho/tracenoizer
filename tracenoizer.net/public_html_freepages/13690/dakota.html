Taoyateduta led the Dakota bands that went to war in 1862 after years of seeing their people suffer poverty and starvation, the direct result of the government's failure to live up to its treaty obligations, and of dishonest traders who exploited the situation and cheated the Dakotas out of treaty payments. The government had a long held belief that the way to "Americanize" the Dakota people was to make them become farmers. individual property owners; the intent was to undermine the life of the tribe.</td>

 Little did they know, Gray Bird, a warrior chief had found their campground. Gray Bird and some 200 Sioux warriors plotted and planned the attack on Brown and his men. The Dakota set up around Brown's camp and waited with their guns and weapons until dawn. That morning of September 2, 1862, became well known as the day of the heaviest military casualties of the Dakota Conflict. After the Dakota opened fire the settlers were quick to their feet.</td>

 Since the Sioux had been disgusted with their situation for some time they saw fit to attack the white man when he was at his weakest fighting other whites. It is interesting and perhaps ironic that at the same time African-Americans struggled for freedom, Native Americans faced a very similar conflict. In this case the Dakota choose to battle for their land and freedom at the same time African-Americans are about to gain emancipation. After being swindled into debt by fur traders via purchasing on credit due to late rations, the Dakota Indians were practically forced into signing a treaty relinquishing all lands west of the Mississippi. Mix informed the Dakota chiefs that the government also required all lands north of the Minnesota River which included half of their reservation.</td>
