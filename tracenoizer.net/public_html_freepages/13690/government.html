 Crow The Crow Tribe The Crow Tribe live on a reservation in Montana and sent 26 delegates to the congress. The Crow are considered to be predatory in habit, although they have never been at war with the whites. In fact, they have usually been known to furnish groups of scouts for the government service in the various Indian campaigns of that region.

During this battle he was shot and hacked almost to pieces and finally left for dead, but managed to save his life by covering himself with the blanket of a dead Dakota.</td>
