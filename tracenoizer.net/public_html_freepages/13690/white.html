 Brown and his men walked over the road to Redwood Ferry and eventually to Birch Coulee, where the battle would take place. They picked up and buried the bodies of settlers they found along the way. Early the next morning, they divided to look for more bodies, eventually finding a total of forty-five white victims that day. Little did they know, Gray Bird, a warrior chief had found their campground. Gray Bird and some 200 Sioux warriors plotted and planned the attack on Brown and his men.</td>

 The reader learns of various significant Indian battles, and defeat, which took place across the land. Such as the Black Hills, Paha Sapa, an island of conifer forest amongst the vast grasslands of the high plains, and held sacred by the Sioux. How ironic it is that this desperately defended Indian ground once lost, is later to be even further "desecrated" when it among all places is chosen as the site for which the massive likeness of 4 white leaders shall be carved into the very heart of the revered mountains. This captivating and heart wrenching book concludes with a final scene taking place shortly after the massacre at Wounded Knee. Dead and injured Indians are being laid to rest along the straw covered floor of an Episcopalian church.</td>

 The Crow are considered to be predatory in habit, although they have never been at war with the whites. In fact, they have usually been known to furnish groups of scouts for the government service in the various Indian campaigns of that region. The most prominent man of the delegation was White-swan (pictured left), a former scout and the sole survivor of the Custer massacre in 1876. During this battle he was shot and hacked almost to pieces and finally left for dead, but managed to save his life by covering himself with the blanket of a dead Dakota. With his hearing destroyed by blows of the tomahawk, his hands crippled by bullets, and his whole body covered with enduring scars, he is still able to tell the story in fluent sign language.</td>
