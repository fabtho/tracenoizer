 . This time the settlers really wanted to defeat and punish the Sioux. Brown and his men walked over the road to Redwood Ferry and eventually to Birch Coulee, where the battle would take place. They picked up and buried the bodies of settlers they found along the way.

 In fact, they have usually been known to furnish groups of scouts for the government service in the various Indian campaigns of that region. The most prominent man of the delegation was White-swan (pictured left), a former scout and the sole survivor of the Custer massacre in 1876. During this battle he was shot and hacked almost to pieces and finally left for dead, but managed to save his life by covering himself with the blanket of a dead Dakota. With his hearing destroyed by blows of the tomahawk, his hands crippled by bullets, and his whole body covered with enduring scars, he is still able to tell the story in fluent sign language. They dress in prairie moccasins, breech-cloth, and buckskin dress.</td>
