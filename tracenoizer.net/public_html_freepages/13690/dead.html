 Quest (Grugan of the Regulars) Words by Martha Keller, adapted and with music by Michael Longcor. Hanging to their ponies and a-yelling as coyotes do, With rifle fire a-spitting fire behind them as they fled. Lighted from his horse to kneel beside the feathered dead to feel A body that was serpent-scaled, a body in a sheath. Saw a Sioux was wearing steel from head to foot, from head to heel, Though silver-scaled chain armor veiled the copper skin beneath. Was old Leif Ericson the first to seek the setting sun.</td>

They found thirteen bodies and over ninety dead horses laying in the ground. Forty-seven men were seriously injured and many more men were hurt. There were only two Dakota dead as a result of the Birch Coulee Battle.</td>

 . Dee Brown makes prodigious use of footnotes and bibliography, from Congressional Records to U. The author documents the scope and breadth of racism held by most whites at the time toward the brown skinned natives, by people such as President Abraham Lincoln, to General Phillip "the only good Indian is a dead Indian" Sheridan. You will learn how Congress gives the movement a politically expedient and identifiable name, calling it Manifest Destiny. For example, what percentage of American's give little or no second thought when considering the idea that the nation most certainly should extend from "sea to shining sea".</td>
