 If you are a member of the planetary science community, please take a moment to complete the PDS Survey. . Planetary Data System Home The Planetary Data System (PDS) archives and distributes scientific data from NASA planetary missions, astronomical observations, and laboratory measurements. The PDS is sponsored by NASA's Office of Space Science. Its purpose is to ensure the long-term usability of NASA data and to stimulate advanced research.</td>

 " Not only does the temperature rise, but the amount of carbon dioxide released by the equatorial Pacific Ocean decreases. At present, the equatorial Pacific is the largest oceanic source of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. NASA's Aqua spacecraft is ready to ship to Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif. Aqua's 170-mile journey will begin late Sunday night, February 24 from TRW's Space Park manufacturing facility, via a special shipping container. Aqua will arrive at Vandenberg on Monday, February 25, where it will undergo final tests and integration with a Delta II rocket for launch in April.</td>

 . Students from around the country will take control of a prototype Mars rover named FIDO as it explores a Nevada desert. May 17, 2000 --Several groups of high school students will take the controls of NASA's prototype Mars rover, the Field Integrated Design and Operations (FIDO) rover, this week as part of ongoing field tests designed to simulate robotic driving conditions on the red planet. Eric Baumgartner, systems engineer for FIDO rover development at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. The teams will only see the site through the eyes of the rover.</td>
