Its history dates back to the 1940's and 1950's when thinkers such as Wiener, von Bertalanffy, Ashby and von Foerster founded the domain through a series of interdisciplinary meetings. Systems theory or systems science argues that however complex or diverse the world that we experience, we will always find different types of organization in it, and such organization can be described by concepts and principles which are independent from the specific domain at which we are looking. Hence, if we would uncover those general laws, we would be able to analyse and solve problems in any domain, pertaining to any type of system. The systems approach distinguishes itself from the more traditional analytic approach by emphasizing the interactions and connectedness of the different components of a system.">

Solution Science Systems Solution Science Systems is a full life-cycle research entity, encompassing all aspects of SSScientific development. The purpose of this Interweb node is to feature examples of our Bioelectric Aural Research Development (BARD) findings and other new developments in Sonic Reduction. We welcome you, and invite you to examine and enjoy these specimens, the culmination of decades of SolSci research.</td>

 , neural networks in the retina) as well as the interaction of these subsystems in well-defined psychophysical tasks (e. Special emphasis is given on transferring the principles of information processing from one sense system to the other (e. ,with regard to mechanisms of object recognition) and on the interaction between sensory systems. Parts of the results will be used for clinical and technical applications such as medical imaging techniques or auditory-based speech processing for improving the man-machine-communication. Such a biology-inspired implementation of information processing in embedded systems is expected to be advantageous with respect to robustness and general applicability of the processing algorithms.</td>
