 Inland valley lowlands have an important potential for the intensification and diversification of agricultural production and are a privileged environment for biodiversity conservation. Despite this potential, the use of inland valleys is currently still limited, both in time (limited use in dry season) and in space (numerous valley bottoms are not exploited yet). The IVC favors a multi-disciplinary approach not only for inland valley characterization, but also for their sustainable development. Consortium structure The organization of the IVC is based on the principles of partnership and shared responsibilities among its members, both national and international. It takes into account each institution's comparative advantages to improve efficiency in conducting IVC activities.</td>
