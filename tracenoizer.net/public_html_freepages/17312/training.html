 Experts from the AHDS will speak on the key technical issues that are relevant to any digital project in the arts and humanities. Managing Agent and Advisory Service for Moving Images and Sound (MAAS) The PADS has recently established a Memorandum of Understanding with the Managing Agent and Advisory Service for Moving Images and Sound (MAAS). The PADS and MAAS will work together to provide the best possible moving image and sound resources for the performing arts communities in UK Higher and Further education and will work with those communities to best meet their needs in resource delivery and documentation and in user training and outreach. We're especially interested to hear about new research and projects involving digital data, datasets of value to the scholarly community in the performing arts or plans for digitisation of sound or moving image material. uk To join follow the instructions at the JISCmail website If you have any difficulties, contact the list owner, Catherine Owen.</td>
