 Overview and Updates - Trade Knowledge Network Overview and Updates TKN Home . Its aim is to increase awareness, knowledge and understanding of the issues among developing country research institutions, NGOs and governments. The first involved research and workshops in selected countries. In each country, a research partner organization surveyed the key domestic trade and sustainable development linkages, and went into greater depth with two or three case studies. These papers were then the basis for workshops in each country, with IISD and IUCN contributing a picture of what's happening at the international level.</td>

 mx THE NET STAFF TONY COLLERAINE, PRESIDENT, DIRECTOR GENERAL Born in England, Tony migrated to America and was educated at Princeton where he earned his doctorate in Physics. He then taught at several universities and research institutes, and worked in high technology private industry on the development of new energy sources for the future. When he retired, in 1985, and decided to live full time in San Felipe, he felt the need for connectivity to be able to stay in touch with the work he had been involved with and to satisfy demands upon him for consulting and collaborating services. Not only was San Felipe's telephone service primitive at that time, but Dr. Colleraine, who still speaks but limited Spanish, decided his first task was to do what he could to get more telephones in this town and to create a dedicated Internet access portal.</td>
