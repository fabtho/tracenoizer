 c) all that remained was to develop that compile it, run it and test it. But the way it converts from degrees to radians os different. A new function is invoked, called deg_to_rad and this looks after the conversion rather than doing it directly. Although each program built on the previous one I still found it difficult and without groundwork being done before the actual lab itself it would have been impossible for me to complete it in three hours. The fact that the programs were related was some help as you establish certain "buliding blocks" and use these again and again.</td>

 This is an important aspect of containing domestic violence treatment. Identification of standard resources across communities will be presented. The interaction of cultural issues and domestic violence can impede the counseling process with perpetrators and victims unless counselors address these issues directly. Development of ethnic sensitivity for counselors will be encouraged. This will be presented in the context of domestic violence law, and the history of violence against women.</td>

 Land Development and Water Management Eight projects were conducted on this theme in various key sites across the different countries. Testing and transfer of technologies, including nature conservation technologies Twelve projects were conducted on this theme. The current strategy adopted by the IVC seeks to move gradually from research activities on characterization to studies emphasizing more directly development applications; projects focusing on land development and water management or on testing or transfer of technologies will therefore be encouraged. Moreover, the IVC is developing initiatives for larger-scale projects that would be multi-year and involve several countries and international institutions. Activities at the National Level These activities are implemented by the National Coordination Units.</td>
