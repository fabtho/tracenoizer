 Our children appreciate and esteem their Okinawan heritage. Viva Okinawa, the place where people rival the terrain for beauty. I attended Zukeran and Amelia Earhart Intermediate School. I left in 1987 and last visited in January of 1991. Please E-Mail me if you remember me or if you just want to chat.</td>
