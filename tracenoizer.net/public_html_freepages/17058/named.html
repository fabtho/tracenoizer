 USA Hey anyone out there that went to CKIS during 84 or 85. During that time there was only 4 white people in the High School. Frank Allen was there also his sister who was a model at the that time named Gina Na Na ( I think). Also looking for anyone named Randy Brown or Brian Coe. How about a Japanese guy named Higa that hung out at the seawall with a great dane dog and a Woody that he drove.</td>
