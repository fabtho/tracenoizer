 Ted Lange Senior Instructor Soken Kinen Kan, Shorin-ryu Matsumura Seito Karate-do. I have visited Okinawa 3 times, and have many nice memories. Lived in an apartment at Moromi and later on Highway 1 at Oyama, next to a Hond Motorcycle shop. I liked the Club Champion and other bars in Koza (Now Okinawa City) and ate in cafes in Kadena Circle. I was a member of Co A, 1st Special Forces Group(Abn) 1st Special Forces.</td>
