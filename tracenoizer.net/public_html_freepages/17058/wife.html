 I have to say that the short year that I was there was the best time of my life. Santa Rosa, California USA I just discovered your page trying to find www. My wife is Japanese and I've just had Windows 95 in Japanese placed on a separate drive but we don't have a functioning word processer. I wonder what you use, what browser, to read Japanese. Do program do you use to write in Japanese on the internet, that is if you do.</td>
