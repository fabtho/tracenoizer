 I really had the time of my life and if I could come back I would. My son was born over there, my best friend Mary Jo, her husband was a diver and he would bring us beautiful shells. I got to go to the Philipines shopping with my friends, not mary jo tho and that was also exciting. I still keep in touch with all my friends from there, I did lose some, but I can't remember there names. I am divorced now and I didn't get to keep any of my treasures from there, the ex got everything, but I still got my memories.</td>
