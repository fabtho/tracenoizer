 it may only spoil the memories of some 40 years ago. My step-son was their in 1994 and said it had become to westernized and had taken on a hint of Japan. I remember when the tallest building was in the city of Naha (4 stories) now I am told the building reach the sky and that their remains little open space - simply buildings, roads and houses. Such a sad note that the world is becoming over populated which brings more roads, more houses and more buildings. Before closing I would simply like to send a sincere apoligize for the incident, some two years ago, when a serviceman raped a young Okinanwan girl.</td>
