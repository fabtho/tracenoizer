 Award recipients who wish to receive summer quarter funding should discuss this with Jodene Davis, Mary Gates Endowment for Students Coordinator, prior to summer quarter. Mary Gates Scholars If you are awarded a research training grant, you will be named a Mary Gates Scholar. As a lifetime member of this University honor society, you will have several opportunities each year to come together with other Mary Gates Scholars to meet with and learn from each other and from campus and community leaders. One of these opportunities is the Undergraduate Research Symposium held in May each year. .</td>

 It is based on the Corvey library's collection (in Germany) of Romantic literature, which holds one of the largest collections of English popular literature for the period. Very little work has been carried out on many of the authors. Part of the library has been published on microfiche; the belle-lettres microfiche edition was purchased by Sheffield Hallam University Library, and provides the core material for the Corvey Project. One major product of the Corvey Project is its online database of women writers and their works based on this microfiche. Another is Corinne, an online journal with contributions from students and staff within the university and beyond.</td>

 A well-known theory among psychologists is that people are most motivated when they feel competent, in-control and have a sense of belonging. Those feelings are harder to sustain in children from the inner city, where nearly every family is touched by violence, addiction and transiency, says Dr. William McMiller, who directs a community mental health clinic at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Children already engulfed in these problems tend to withdraw more quickly when they feel unsuccessful in school, he says. Faced with a resistant or even hostile student, frustrated teachers likewise may withdraw some of their own effort.</td>
