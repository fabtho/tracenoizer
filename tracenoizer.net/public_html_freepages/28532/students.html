 A follow-on visit was made half way through the second term, when further interviews were held with the principal course tutor and a group of students (some of whom had been interviewed at the start of the course). . Students can consult the online resources developed for the Corvey Project while preparing their assessed work, and can also contribute articles for publication on the Corvey Web site. An additional module for second year students was also created, though discontinued after one year. The Corvey Project will be used on other modules in the School.</td>

 Undergraduate Research Program - Homepage Search for Welcome The Undergraduate Research Program (URP) facilitates research experiences for undergraduates with UW faculty members across the disciplines. URP maintains a listing of current UW research opportunities and related national programs. The Annual UW Undergraduate Research Symposium provides a forum for students to present their work to the university community and the public. We invite faculty members to post their student research opportunites on this web site, and to use our Faculty Resources section for information on incorporating undergraduates into research and scholarship, and for local and national funding sources. URP staff are available for consultation with students and faculty during drop-in hours or by appointment.</td>

 Last year, 27 percent of freshmen failed English, according to the Consortium on Chicago School Research. That percentage is down six points since 1994, a period during which the percentage of freshmen scoring at or above national norms in reading rose 15 points. In the academic quarter ending in January, 44 percent of all Chicago high school students failed one or more courses, School Board data show. The problem, teachers say, is that the kids lack motivation. Researchers and social welfare professionals who deal with city kids agree.</td>
