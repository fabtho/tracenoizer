 Although most tracks on this CD incorporate manipulated voices, there is no discernible text. The intention of this project was to use environ- mental sounds, voices, and atmospheres to create the feeling of a memory or a dream not wholly remembered. They are highly claustrophobic and obsessive shorter pieces, some of which again feature the voice of Alva Svoboda, sampled and manipulated. This CD was also released in special oversized packaging. This is an attempt to abstract the events of Verdi's life in terms of music.</td>
