The late Koo also emphasized the importance of exploring new business opportunity toward growth while ensuring that his company and its ownership were family-oriented. Following his father's death at the end of 1969, Koo Cha-kyung, as the eldest son, took over chairmanship of the company and basically sustained his father's corporate and management principles. From the early 1980s, Koo felt the need to recognize the changes of the times and modified LG's core management principles while generally preserving the founding ethos.
