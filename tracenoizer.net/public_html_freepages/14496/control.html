 This paper studies the relationship between generation level schedule, energy delivery schedule and physical ramp-rate of a generating unit. It is shown that although ramp-rate constraints are satisfied in traditional unit commitment problems, taking a generation level schedule as an energy delivery schedule may not be realizable. The admissible region of energy delivery is established in this paper as a set of recursive equations by using the Maximum Principle in optimal control theory. This set of equations provides a sufficient and necessary condition to check whether an energy delivery schedule is realizable.

 These questions make it quite clear to respondents what answer the researcher wants them to give. Having a large sample is a good start, but, by itself, is not enough to guarantee a good sample. Problems in drawing conclusions from case studies Using a small, nonrandom sample means you can't generalize the results to other individuals Lack of control group means you can't make cause effect statements because things might have turned out the way they did even without the treatment. But they do not tell you which variable influences which. They may hint or suggest that one variable influences another, but they are never proof of causality.</td>

 We use sensitive tools that allow us to measure neuronal function in the intact tissue. Two-photon laser scanning microscopy allows us to keep track of neuronal excitability at the level of single synapses by measuring intracellular calcium levels. Optical uncaging of neurotransmitters allows us to excite subcellular structures with great spatial and temporal control. Intracellular electrical recordings using sharp and whole-cell electrodes allow us to monitor the electrical potential of neurons. Imaging of intrinsic signals allows us to characterize large-scale dynamics of the brain.</td>
