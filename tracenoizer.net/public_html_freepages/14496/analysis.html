 Return to top of page Quantitative Research - Primers HyperStat Online, David Lane, The Rice Virtual Lab in Statistics. Univariate statistical methods are expanded gradually, first thoroughly exploring bivariate statistical methods (linear transformations with two variables, multiple regression with two independent variables) and culminating with multiple regression models. Analysis of Variance is approached as a special case of multiple regression. The goal is to provide a path from the simple case leading to the complex.
