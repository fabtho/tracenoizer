 He had to swear an oath never to attack the Turks He was also put in jail for 12 years by the King of Wallachia and after he died the new king let Dracula out provided he swore an oath to abandon Greek Orthodoxy and become Roman Catholic Then there is a story that when Vlad was a boy he mutilated and impaled small birds (viz Renfield in Dracula) Impalement victim had legs pulled by horses onto a stake . which was rounded at the end and oiled so as NOT to cause immediate death Dracula may or may not have been a cannibal (ie werewolf) but he most certainly forced others into it . often forcing mothers to eat their babies Dracule always left cadavers to rot The (in)famous Vlad banquet amidst impaled people in concentric circles with those of highest rank at the centre was April 6, 1459 in the city of Brasov Impalement could be top down, bottom up or through the navel Most impalings done only between 1459 and 1461 In a battle in 1456 he impaled 20,000 Turks at once witnessed by Mohammed II outside Targoviste (Vlad's capital). Impalements were spread out over 2 square miles Dracule was a (sort of) hero in Romania because he made the streets so "safe" that you could leave a purse in the middle of the road and no one would pick it up. she may have jumped prematurely being afraid Vlad would lose the battle Vlad's tomb discovered accidentally in 1922 by a young Romanian student named Constantin C.</td>

 His real education began in 1436 after his father succeeded in claiming the Wallachian throne and killing his Danesti rival. His training was typical of that common to the sons of the nobility throughout Europe. His first tutor in his apprenticeship to knighthood was an elderly boyar who had fought under the banner of Enguerrand de Courcy at the Battle of Nicolopolis against the Turks. Dracula learned all the skills of war and peace that were deemed necessary for a Christian knight. The political situation in Wallachia remained unstable after Vlad Dracul seized the throne in 1436.</td>

 Dracula had intentionally put this fountain in a deserted place to test dishonest wayfarers. So great was the fear of impalement, however, that so long as he lived no one dared to steal the cup, and it was left at its place. 1453 saw the fall of the Roman fortress at Constantinople, though that was not a battle without consequence. Nevertheless, it was a battle Vlad and his army played a pivotal role in. A series of overwhelmingly victorious attacks made through both Wallachia and Transylvania in 1456 made Prince Dracula a feared and hated name to many.</td>
