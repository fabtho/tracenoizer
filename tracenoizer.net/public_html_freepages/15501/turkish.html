 Well, despite some of the obvious fiction associated with Dracula, Dracula really and truly existed. He was a historical figure that actualized the same insatiable lust for blood and power that the fictionalized stories depict. Dracula was a 15th century Wallachian (Rumanian) prince who was often described in German, Slavonic, Byzantine, and Turkish literature as a diabolically cruel and demented ruler. He had the blood of Hungarians, Germans, and other Christians, and especially the Turks (Muslims) on his hands. He had such an ingenious mind for various kinds of torture--physical and mental--that he was labeled the impaler.</td>
