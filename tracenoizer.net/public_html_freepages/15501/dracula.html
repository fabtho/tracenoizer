 In addition, similar narratives have been documented independently by a wide variety of respected, unbiased historians throughout Europe, leading to the inevitable conclusion that these exploits of Vlad "the Impaler" are indeed factual and unexaggerated. Even the Rumanian people, who to this day view the Draculas as a great and noble race, do not deny these acts of unparalleled violence. To Dracula's question about this impropriety, the emissaries replied that such was their custom. The witty governor had their fezzes nailed to their heads in order to "fix them in this observance.

 Walachia was founded in 1290 by a Transylvanian named Radu Negru, or Rudolph the Black. It was dominated by Hungary until 1330, when it became independent. The first ruler of the new country was Prince Basarab the Great (1310-1352), an ancestor of Dracula. Dracula's grandfather, Prince Mircea the Old, reigned from 1386 to 1418. He participated in one too many losing battles against the Turks and was forced to pay tribute to them.</td>

 .asp'); endSubMenu(); VLAD TEPES by Ray Porter (1992) I. Historical Background Most of the members of this list are probably aware of the fact that when Bram Stoker penned his immortal classic, Dracula, he based his vampire villain on an actual historical figure. Stoker's model was Vlad III Dracula (call Tepes, pronounced tse-pesh); a fifteenth century voivode or prince of Wallachia of the princely House of Basarab. Wallachia is a province of Romania bordered to the north by Transylvania and Moldavia, to the east by the Black Sea and to the south by Bulgaria.</td>
