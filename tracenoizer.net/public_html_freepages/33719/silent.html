 The station lay on the other side of the tracks; it was not much more than a siding and a shed. There was no means of conveyance to be seen, but the station chief supposed that the traveler might secure a vehicle from a general store and inn to be found some ten or twelve blocks away. The sun had already disappeared from view, but a final splendor, exalted the vivid and silent plain, before the night erased its color. Less to avoid fatigue than to draw out his enjoyment of these sights, Dahmann walked slowly, breathing in the odor of clover with sumptuous joy. The general store at one time had been painted a deep scarlet, but the years had tempered this violent color for its own good.</td>

 But in Berlin I see you dragging your stuff to the neighborhood laundromat in plastic bags. I don't feel like I need to make any effort when I am here. I take the overnight train from Paris, and I arrive really early in the morning, when the city is only slightly awake and silent. The train going from west to east creates a sort of urban intimacy. So my rapport with the city is quite easy and immediate, without any particular expectations.</td>
