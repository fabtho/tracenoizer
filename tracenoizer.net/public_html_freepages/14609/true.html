 Love is an intense feeling of caring for another person. It can take many different forms (romantic, friendly, familial) but it is always about caring. Although it is true that a big part of love is putting another person's happiness ahead of your own this never includes compromising your values or being untrue to yourself. If somebody asks you to do something that you don't want to do in order to "prove" your love they do not love you the way you might think they do. When you love another person you don't ask them to sacrifice a part of themselves in the name of that love.</td>

 . We are born in a body with animal instincts, we carry the baggage of past lives (it seems) and to add to this we develop survival solutions upon the lines of our racial culture, and according to our particular upbringing and experiences. This is a complex and tangled mixture but it is possible to separate out these strands and to find our true identity. In so doing we also discover the reasons why friendships break down, marriages go sour and misunderstandings occur, why life may contain more stress than pleasure and why our purposes in life become obscured. With this knowledge we can transform our minds - and that is the prerequisite to fundamental change for the better.</td>
