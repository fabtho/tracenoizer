 Nephrology Clinical Research Programs The Nephrology Clinical Research Programs continue to advance the science of renal care. Jamerson continue to be investigators for the national African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension study, which has made significant observations on the optimal management of hypertension and renal disease in African Americans. Figure 2 shows data from a recent New England Journal of Medicine paper by Dr. Port and colleagues who have demonstrated that the mortality rate of Americans with end-stage renal disease is declining, especially in those patients with diabetes. Similar improvements are observed for patients after the second year of dialysis.</td>

 First, it provides an inhanced seed population in the hundred keV energy range due to substorm injections. Second, the ULF wave activity in the 10 minute period range is enhanced. Further investigation of what we have interpreted as torroidal oscillations, based on analysis of the MHD simulation data, will be pursued elsewhere. In summary, we have simulated an impulsive rise in relativistic electron flux on January 10, 1997, correlated with an observed increase in ULF wave activity on the nightside in a frequency range comensurate with electron drift periods. Solar wind parameters from the WIND spacecraft were used to drive the longest 3D global MHD simulation to date, and the output fields were used to push guiding center relativistic electron trajectories in the equatorial plane.</td>
