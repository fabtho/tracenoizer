 Other offerings from CBT Systems currently in planning and development will address Internet design, internetwork troubleshooting, switch configuration, and dial-up services. These new curricula will be of interest to students preparing for other Cisco Career Certification program exams. This initiative is a series of education, branding, and marketing programs aimed at helping developers learn more about Java and how their companies can successfully leverage this technology. The curriculum is aimed at programmers and application developers, and is streamed for both students who requiring an introduction to the fundamentals of object-oriented programming and experienced OOP developers who require a "fast-track" approach to Java. Students can then progress to the specifics of Java classes and user-interface programming with Java.</td>
