The foreign staff has mastered this a little bit better. Adee completes the sports department's new management troika, created after sports editor John Cherwa was reassigned in January to Orlando, where he oversees company-wide sports coverage and edits special projects for the (Trib-owned) Orlando Sentinel. Cherwa's deputy, Dan McGrath, was promoted to the top spot, and now he'll have two deputies to rely on. Adee will be responsible for the daily and Sunday report, particularly goosing the staff to turn out aggressive and imaginative beat reporting.">
