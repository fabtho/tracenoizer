 .edu When materials and devices are shrunk to a sufficiently small size, their electrical, optical, and thermal characteristics become distinctly different from those on a larger scale. Professor Chen's research addresses thermal problems in micron and nanoscale materials and devices using analytical, experimental and numerical methods. The goals of this research are (1) to understand fundamental heat transfer processes in small scales and (2) to solve important heat transfer problems in electrical and optical engineering and materials science. A list of research topics is available I have moved.</td>
