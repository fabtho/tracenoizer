 Various clubs and associations, reflecting the different disciplines, were formed around his teachings each of which developed independently until 1987 when Brian returned to Britain from China. Whilst in China he was granted authorization from the Chinese Wushu Research Institute ( Beijing ) to create the Chinese Wushu Research Institute (GB). The diversity of activities available encouraged many students to study other disciplines within the Institute which further contributed to generating a better understanding of all aspects of Wushu. As the years passed, experienced students were invited to attend coaches courses which then allowed the club to expand even further as classes were formed in a variety of disciplines. The aims of CWRI(GB) are to enable everyone who attends the classes to enjoy good quality martial arts - whatever the discipline.</td>
