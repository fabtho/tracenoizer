 The sources section is a guide to English and Chinese materials relating to historical research on modern China. The archives section provides information on Chinese local archives and also serves as a site for researchers to exchange information. The bibliography section contains a list of English-language works on Qing, Republican, and PRC history. The links section contains a list of China-related web sites and provides quick access to the on-line catalogues of East Asian libraries throughout the world. The current research section will, when complete, provide registered users with up-to-date information on who is doing what research.</td>

 If a book (or journal) you need is not available in the law library or on main campus, Circulation may be able to borrow it through interlibrary loan. Information on these options is available at the MARIAN homepage below. Cards are arranged in alphabetical order by romanized author, title, series, or by English language subject headings. You may also restrict your search to books published in a specified year or range of years, in a given language, or by a particular publisher. For help in searching, use the online help screens or ask a librarian.</td>

 Over the millenia, there have been many languages and dialects spoken in the various regions of the country, although most of them are closely related. Thus, a Cantonese speaker in Hong Kong cannot understand a Mandarin speaker from Beijing when they speak; and neither can understand a Wu speaker from Shanghai; but the problem is quickly resolved by simply writing down what they wish to say. All three have the identical written language, and thus immediate communication is established. The downside to this is that the poor Chinese student must learn literally thousands of characters, just to read a newspaper. ) And to read the literary classics of China, one must learn as many as 40,000 characters.</td>
