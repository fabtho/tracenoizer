 Each table contains a citation of the data source(s). . We attempt to present data in the most meaningful format. Your suggestions, based on actual use of the Digest, are always welcome, as are suggestions to include frequently needed information. However, some information is obtained from other University offices, and we are grateful for the cooperation and assistance of those offices in annually providing data.</td>
