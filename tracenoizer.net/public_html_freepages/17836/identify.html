 Understanding Hardware Resources - IRQ In this first one of three excellent articles, ChrisP discusses IRQs with the intent of clarifying device configuration and resource conflict resolution. Identifying A Motherboard Don't know what type of motherboard your system is built around. We share a number of tricks that will help you identify even the most obscure motherboard. Adding More Memory Adding RAM is a great way to improve system performance. We'll show you what you need to know before you go shopping to make sure you get the right memory for your PC.</td>

 lpdoc generates a reference manual automatically from one or more source files for a logic program (including ISO-Prolog, Ciao, many CLP systems, . It is particularly useful for documenting library modules, for which it automatically generates a description of the module interface. A fundamental advantage of using lpdoc to document programs is that it is much easier to maintain a true correspondence between the program and its documentation, and to identify precisely to what version of the program a given printed manual corresponds. The assertions and comments included in the source file need to be written using the Ciao system assertion language. A simple compatibility library is available to make traditional (constraint) logic programming systems ignore these assertions and comments allowing normal treatment of programs documented in this way.</td>
