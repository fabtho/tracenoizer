Pryor's Development System - Mind and Memory - Fabulous Visual Images Beyond the Doors The mind processes visual imagery on both conscious and subconscious levels. The eyes take in so much detail that the subconscious mind must filter it before encoding for memory. In the process of forming a memory, each mind spontaneously draws upon the subconscious or fabulous mental legacy of its cultural past to interact with new detail and produce unique resonances of meaning.">

 High - frequency pulsed energy delivered to the battery plates removes sulfates and returns them to the electrolyte. This cleans the plates and also revives the electrolyte, providing more power, greater resistance to freezing, and longer battery life. When sulfation is controlled, a battery AND ITS CHARGING SYSTEM can work better and last longer. A battery MAINTAINED in good condition with pulse technology charges more efficiently and performs better at ALL temperatures. This reduces charging system load for better, more economical electrical system operation.</td>
