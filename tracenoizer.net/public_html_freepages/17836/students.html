In addition to the senior research project, our undergraduates can get involved in research in several other ways. These projects are supported with funding through external grants to the individual faculty involved with the work.</td>

 This example presents a series of explorations based on two linked representations of linear functions. . Creating, Describing, and Analyzing Patterns to Recognize Relationships and Make Predictions This three-part example highlights different aspects of students' understanding and use of patterns as they analyze relationships and make predictions, as discussed in the Algebra Standard. The interactive figure illustrates how students can create pattern units of squares then predict how patterns with different numbers of squares, will appear when repeated in a grid, and check their predictions. In the second part, Describing Patterns, examples of various ways students might interpret the same sequence of cubes are given.</td>
