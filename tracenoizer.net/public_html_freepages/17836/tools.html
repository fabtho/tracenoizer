The Chiron system provides tools for assisting in the development of graphical user interfaces and provides a run-time system for managing and supporting their dynamic behavior. The objective of the Chiron system is to reduce long-term costs associated with developing and maintaining graphical user interface (GUI) software. It achieves this objective by providing key interface layers which are resilient to change.">

 . The executables are free to use, either for personal hobby use, or full blown commercial productions -- I know of at least a dozen commercial games you can purchase that are written with RGBDS -- and the source code is free to modify. The only thing I ask is that you do not charge for either distributing the executables or source code, and any derivative works you give credit to the original authors of the tools. That means you have to say "Thanks" to SurfSmurf and Otaku. The assembler is constantly being updated and improved.</td>

 This trend has been enabled by advances in IT and has increased dependence on IT, which has exacerbated potential vulnerabilities. Thus, computer security has taken on increasing importance, with the profusion of both malicious and unintended compromises to computing and communications infrastructures. These seemingly divergent considerations must be resolved into a harmonious relationship if information technology tools are to be reliable and effective. This conference program draws on experiences and viewpoints of the university, industry, government and research laboratory sectors. It will provide a forum for collaboration tool providers, notable collaboration partners, computer security practitioners, and officials responsible for enforcing security provisions.</td>

 Most importantly, these restrictions and extensions can be activated separately on each program module so that several extensions can coexist in the same application for different modules. Ciao also offers support for programming in the small producing small executables (including only those builtins used by the program) and support for writing scripts in Prolog. The Ciao programming environment includes a classical top-level and a rich emacs interface with an embeddable source-level debugger and a number of execution visualization tools. Library modules can be compiled into compact bytecode or C source files, and linked statically, dynamically, or autoloaded. The novel modular design of Ciao enables, in addition to modular program development, effective global program analysis and static debugging and optimization via source to source program transformation.</td>
