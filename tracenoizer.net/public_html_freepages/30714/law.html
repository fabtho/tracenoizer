 Executive Committee of the CLTA in 2000 Clause 4(b) of the CLTA Constitution provides that the members of the Executive Committee shall be a President, Secretary, Treasurer, the immediately preceding past President and four other members. The 2000 conference was the third occasion on which the Institute of Chartered Secretaries awarded a prize for the best paper presented at the annual conference. At the 2000 conference, Emeritus Professor Harold Ford was made the first life member of the CLTA, as an acknowledgment of his outstanding contribution to corporate law scholarship and teaching over 35 years. The conference proved to be a particularly successful initiative for the CLTA in a number of ways. A fourth way in which the conference was successful was in terms of the quality of the speakers who made themselves available to speak at the conference.</td>

 . It was not until late in the nineteenth century that companies began to be seen as something wholly different from partnerships. It was little more than a hundred years ago that the separate legal personality of a company fully emerged and company law doctrines, separate and distinct from partnership doctrines, finally developed. At the same time, shareholders now had rights and responsibilities that were different from those enjoyed by partners. In more recent years, especially as public companies have become larger and more powerful, the role of shareholders and the analysis of the corporate form itself have been further modified.</td>
