 Dialog position should also be set to "Let window manager decide" and Dialog hints should be "Dialogs are treated specially by window manager. " This assumes you are using a modern window manager which mostly conforms to the window manager specifications. This should fix the problems some people were seeing, such as dialogs appearing partially offscreen. GNOME should not be trying to place your dialogs for you. So disable "Place dialogs over application window when possible.</td>
