 Together, these pilots flew 4,052 combat missions during the most successful air campaign in military history - Operation Desert Storm. Nearly ten years have passed since the end of the Gulf War, and the pilots who valiantly represented the 388th TFW have moved in various directions. Some are still flying the F-16, while others have left the Air Force to pursue new careers and fulfill other ambitions. I*ve kept in touch with a number of pilots since the end of the war, and I*ve asked them to share some of their experiences with you, the viewer. When did you join the Air Force, and what was your first flying assignment after completing Undergraduate Pilot Training. What aircraft have you flown, and what are the different bases you have been assigned to during your Air Force career. Which models of the F-16 have you flown, and how many hours do you have in the Viper. How many combat missions did you fly, and is there one particular mission that stands out more than any other. What do you remember most about your time spent in the United Arab Emirates at Al Minhad AB. What have you been doing since the war, and where are you now.
