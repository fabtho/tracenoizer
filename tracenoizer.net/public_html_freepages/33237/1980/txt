 The community was composed predominantly of Synechococcus spp. , and large, heterocystous, nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria (Aphanizomenon spp. ), that usually formed buoyant macroscopic aggregates. Nitrogenase activity was not limited by molybdate availability, but, instead, by high concentrations of sulfate. This may explain inhibition of nitrogenase activity at high salinities. Inhibition of nitrogenase activity at high salinity did not occur when sulfate concentration was kept low. Nitrogen fixation and growth of the diazotrophic cyanobacteria were limited by iron. was primarily nitrogen limited but iron appeared to be the secondary limiting substrate, particularly when these organisms depended on nitrate as the source of nitrogen. Nutrient limitation of the picoplanktonic community was particularly apparent when a wind-induced mixing event occurred. These organisms responded by a subsequent doubling of their biomass within 24 h. Mixing of the water column apparently transported nutrients from greater depth into the euphotic zone, causing a temporary relieve of nitrogen limitation.
