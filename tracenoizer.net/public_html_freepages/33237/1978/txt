 My father and brother both flew for the Air Force and both flew in combat. 2) When did you join the Air Force, and what was your first flying assignment after completing Undergraduate Pilot Training. 3) What aircraft have you flown, and what are the different bases you have been assigned to during your Air Force career. 4) Which models of the F-16 have you flown, and how many hours do you have in the Viper. Looking back, what was the experience of combat like for you. Combat was very frightening before and after the missions. 7) How many combat missions did you fly, and is there one particular mission that stands out more than any other. The first and last 2 missions I flew (last night of the war) stand out the most. 8) What do you remember most about your time spent in the United Arab Emirates at Al Minhad AB. Although we only spent about 2 weeks in Al Minhad before going north to King Fahd AB, my most vivid memory is the first night of the war. to hear jets taking off, and I knew it was the beginning of the war. 9) What have you been doing since the war, and where are you now. Since the end of the Gulf War, I made it back with 4 days to spare before my daughter Rachael was born.
