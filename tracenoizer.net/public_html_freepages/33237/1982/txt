 These waterblooms show a patchy distribution and their development is not precisely understood. Most notable are the large accumulations of the filamentous organisms of the genera Nodularia and Aphanizomenon. These organisms form colonies and their cells possess gas vesicles which provide them with buoyancy. Both Nodularia and Aphanizomenon are diazotrophic organisms. Diel variations of nitrogen fixation clearly showed highest activities during the day, although considerable activity was maintained during the night. Depth distributions of nitrogenase activity revealed highest specific activities at the surface. Both in natural samples and in cultures of strains isolated from the Baltic Sea nitrogenase activity was saturated at low light irradiances, which indicated that nitrogen was not limiting growth. Additions of nitrate or ammonium did not impair nitrogen fixation in these organisms. Photosynthesis versus light measurements showed saturation at high intensities. The small-sized picoplanktonic cyanobacteria of the genus Synechococcus are quantitatively most important. The two strains appear to belong to different species as judged from preliminary analyses of 16S rRNA sequences. The green species is more abundant at the surface while the red species is typical for deeper water. Photosynthesis versus light irradiance curves showed that the green species has a low photosynthetic affinity while in contrast the red species had an high affinity. These results are in agreement with their position in the watercolumn. Maximum rates of photosynthesis are comparable for both species and much lower than in the diazotrophs.
