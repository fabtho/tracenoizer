 The ATHAS group was founded by Professor Bernhard Wunderlich, who has worked since 1955 in the field of thermal analysis. The first eight years were spent at Northwestern and Cornell Universities. This was followed by 25 years at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and since 1988 ATHAS is located at The University of Tennessee at Knoxville and Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Since 1980 biannual "ATHAS Reports" have been issued (the last and some earlier ones are still available, for copies contact us). Besides the biannual research reports and lists of publications short articles were written for the ATHAS Reports.</td>
