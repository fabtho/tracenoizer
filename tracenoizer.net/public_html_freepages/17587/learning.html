This includes receiving and processing applications, enrolments and changes to enrolments; accessing timetable information; paying fees and charges; and the administration of educational processes such as accessing timetable and other class information, submitting and returning assignments, accessing assignment and examination results and so on. This includes access to learning resources by electronic means, and using electronic instructional and assessment media.
