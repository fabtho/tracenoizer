 In general, the course will emphasize the applied implications of the various perspectives on decision making. Introduces the theory and application of psychological tests as measures of personality, intellectual functioning, and pathology. The testing situation as a structured interview and as a source of data. The empirical foundations of cognitive-behavioral approaches to psychological problems are based on the two principles of animal learning theory - classical conditioning and operant conditioning with the addition of social learning theory. Also the student will be provided with the practical applications of these theories to a wide spectrum of specific psychological problems and psychiatric disorders.</td>
