The function should take a single argument, which is a value that the user has interactively entered into a cell of the grid-column that is using this function to convert user input. A data-write-converter is typically used when the user can type a string into a grid cell, and the string needs to be converted to some other type of value for internal use. data-write-converter is a property of the grid-column and row-header-column classes.">

 This paper demonstrates techniques that automatically extract such checking information from the source code itself, rather than the programmer, thereby avoiding the need for a priori knowledge of system rules. Static source code checking is different from testing in that it analyzes the source code instead of running it. Today, these systems are used to detect anomalies in the behavior of a single node across time. In Proceedings of Eighteenth ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles, October 2001. .</td>
