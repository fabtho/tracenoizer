 Which may be why I'm so attracted to online bartering. Bartering, as opposed to bidding, is a great alternative for wimps like me. As with auctions, I can post things I want to get rid of. But instead of exchanging money with strangers, I just trade my junk for someone else's. Worst-case scenario, I lose nothing but that CD I never listen to, that book I already read or those earrings I never wear.</td>
