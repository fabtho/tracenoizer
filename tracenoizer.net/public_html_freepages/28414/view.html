 System Quality Resources System Quality Measures of the Information Processing System Itself Measures of System Quality typically focus on performance characteristics of the system under study. Multiple Perspectives of Information System Quality A research project designed to investigate the use quality of computer systems, leading to the development of an Information System (IS) quality framework and a methodology for defining and agreeing IS quality requirements. A soft systemic approach is being combined with multiple perspectives (Technical, Organisation, Personal) to provide a view of IS quality that is broader than traditional approaches to software quality. The research method involves the use of case studies and action research. (an empirical study of IS Success Measures), Peter Seddon, ACIS '96 .</td>
