Sifting through the seventy-some submissions for the juried show she assembled here for MOCA-DC's Felicity Hogan, the tech-minded New Yorker was surprised to find few state-of-the-art pieces in the running.

 com We've been without a Supercan for four years and gave up trying to get a replacement a long time ago. I also successfully scheduled a bulk collection last week. All this makes me feel a bit better about that big DC tax check I mailed a few days ago. net The recent Post paragraph report about 50 phones simply not being hooked up during the recent relocation of DCRA to the 900 block of N. Capitol Street was hardly a work of a master reporter.</td>
