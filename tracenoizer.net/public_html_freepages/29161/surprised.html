 Represented here by exactly two artists, the new-media contingent proves the most intriguing of the bunch. . Sifting through the seventy-some submissions for the juried show she assembled here for MOCA-DC's Felicity Hogan, the tech-minded New Yorker was surprised to find few state-of-the-art pieces in the running. Instead her Washington trove was mostly non-virtual, including lots of abstract painting and graffiti- and animation-inspired work. The show she came up with -- 21 pieces by 12 artists -- reflects the local art scene's reluctance to jump on the new-media bandwagon.</td>
