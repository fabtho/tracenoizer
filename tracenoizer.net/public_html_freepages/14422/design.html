My specific interests at the moment are reinforcement learning; sequential decision making; robot learning; behaviour based systems; and the space between these.

 Pages in webWright had the advantage of being dynamically published from separate content and style-template databases. I have a new partnership, Karma Divers, we train people in the UK and run trips all over the world. We organised conferences, workshops, exhibitions and design experiments all over the world. I am not so active now, but I still host their website. I had large and small clients in the UK and Europe.</td>

 His research in Mainz focused on the development of magic angle spinning NMR experiments for the study of solid polymers. In 1994 he was appointed to a Lectureship in Physical Chemistry at the University of Nottingham. Research Interests Design of new solid-state NMR experiments involving fast magic angle spinning, multiple-quantum coherence and multi-dimensional data acquisition Applications of solid-state NMR to studies of polymer blends, proton conducting materials and biomolecules. For more information about my research interests please see the Web pages of the Solid-state NMR Group Recent Publications 1. 'Isotropic mixing in solid-state heteronuclear correlation experiments.</td>

 You can make rounded rectangles and slice them up so you can have a rounded border line around your tables, or you can round the edges of a page. Experiment, and look at the structure of other pages to see how rounded table corners can make a stunning presentation. ms Tool bars 2 41 hotnuts21 Web Design 0 12 Logi can anyone recommend a good WAP emulator. ..</td>
