 Yes, I went bust like everybody else in the recession. . We also run an MA in HyperMedia Studies with 25 students. I work in collaboration with the Apache Cocoon project, Cocoon is an Open Source project to develop a dynamic XML XSL publishing engine, written in Java. My primary interest is to help develop a remote content management infrastructure for it.</td>
