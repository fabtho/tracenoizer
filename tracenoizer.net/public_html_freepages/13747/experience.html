For real world applications, one must cross what I think of as a "complexity threshold" in order to have a significant impact within the application domain. Recently, challenged by other researchers facing real-world problems (neurosurgeons requiring assistance with surgical planning, for example), I have had the experience of crossing that threshold for real world applications.

 A whole of class group, notionally extended to whole of Faculty introducse seraching and other navigation and information retrieval notions. Yes, at the constructive level it's not really university level stuff - but there are always still a large number of people in our introductory classes who have never gone web surfing, or if they have, have not observed what they've seen in terms of the information structures. And it always works better to relate the descriptive theory to an element of shared introductory experience. ..</td>

 Chris Johnson's Home Page and Petting Zoo Always under construction. This isn't a zoo in the strictest sense, but I sometimes feel like I live in one, and there are some real animals here. This site originated as a learning experience in 1995, but got no attention at all for a few years. The title originated from the photo gallery showing off our collection of domestic animals. This may interest novice webmasters and Photoshop users.</td>

 I am currently Director of Engineering for an artificial limb component manufacturer, College Park Industries, Inc. We specialize in some of the finest artificial feet on earth. I have 31 years of experience as a hobby motorcyclist and off-road competitor, first in Motocross, then Enduro, followed by Cross Country. I love working on motorcycles and figuring out how to make them always a little bit better. .</td>
