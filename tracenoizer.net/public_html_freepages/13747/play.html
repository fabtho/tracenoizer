 . Michael's Country Day School in Newport Rhode Island going into 7th grade. When I went on my windsurfing trip in Hawaii I just couldn't get up and going until I tried that great Starboard Play prototype board. I just hated how the other boards would just sink all the time. This summer I hope to go out and windsurf Second Beach on the Atlantic Ocean with my family.</td>

 I want to know when you feel like you can burn someone deep, do you and Chris have an automatic signal to go to it. That's our first game next year and that's what we're focusing on. I just want to find out your feelings on Chris Simms' play this spring and if he has taken what happened last year as motivation to prove himself this year. He's getting better every day and what happened last year is in the past. They've both worked very hard this spring and I think they'll fill the big shoes of Matt and Big Mike.</td>
