 . The Pattern Book was recently launched by the Premier, Bob Carr. A collaboration between the Department of Urban Affairs and Planning and the Government Architect, the Pattern Book provides a resource for raising the standard of residential flat design in New South Wales. The Government Architect's component consists of three apartment designs for different typical localities, that through the use of principles, components and options, demonstrate how to achieve better residential flat development.
