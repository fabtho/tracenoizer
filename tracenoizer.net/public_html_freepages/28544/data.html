 The Serial Monitor allows users to change the default behavior of the serial ports in Win32-based operating systems, where only one application is allowed to use the port at the present moment. The Serial Monitor achieves it by providing the monitoring device driver, which lies upon the serial device driver of the Windows NT and Windows 2000 operating systems. This driver collects all information including data read and written, control codes received and sent to the underlying hardware by the user mode client, etc. The filter device driver used by the Serial Monitor is the newest generation of the driver, which sources and logic are described and presented in our article in Windows Developers Journal. It can be used to develop online documentation for any software product created with Microsoft Visual Studio 6.</td>
