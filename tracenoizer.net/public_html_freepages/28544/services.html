 HrOpen is a self financed, non profit association organized similarly to other EurOpen national associations. It has been a member of EurOpen since 1993 and it participates in all of the group's activities. The association is open to everyone who wishes to contribute to the development of HrOpen services, its advertising or any other activity in the open computing field. Since its inception, HrOpen's policy has stated that every member should have a login account with a certain minimum disk space, an email address and access to the world wide network information services. Some of the equipment was purchased by HrOpen, and the rest of it donated, thanks to invaluable help from the Croatian Ministry of Science and Technology and the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing (University of Zagreb).</td>
