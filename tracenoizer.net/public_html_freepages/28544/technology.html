 It helps users protect themselves from pressures exerted upon their budget by different vendors and looks to influence the strategic development of future standards in the field of information technologies. HrOpen was established during a particularly difficult time for the country, when such activities didn't seem to have the highest priority. However, there was a strong feeling among the computing (and wider) community that the future of Croatia and its citizens lies in the openness of both its technology and its people as well as in the struggle towards an open world.

It has been a member of EurOpen since 1993 and it participates in all of the group's activities.</td>
