 This has long been a great game and is now pretty much a classic. Its only when I checked later that I found it was stable. I realise you use CVS for development but would you consider numbering stable releases with even minor version numbers (1. to avoid people like me not getting the latest stable version through a bad assumption. I can't see this hurting version numbering but I can see it gaining more users of the latest version.</td>

 Other analytical groups, based on geographic regions and levels of external debt, are also used. Low-income and middle-income economies are sometimes referred to as developing economies. The use of the term is convenient; it is not intended to imply that all economies in the group are experiencing similar development or that other economies have reached a preferred or final stage of development. Classification by income does not necessarily reflect development status. These operational guidelines were established three decades ago, based on the view that since poorer countries deserve better conditions from the Bank, comparative estimates of economic capacity needed to be established.</td>
