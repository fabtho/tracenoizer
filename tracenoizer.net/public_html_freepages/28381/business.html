 1Jump is a cutting-edge desktop software application. It's not a plug-in, and it's not a browser in the conventional sense. It's a standalone software program designed specifically to help business professionals conduct research on companies. Don't settle for static web-based company directories when you can get interactive, current business information that you can actually use. Locate, compare and contrast companies; instantly copy your findings to your spreadsheet or word processor; create instant customized graphs -- these are just some of the reasons why 1Jump is used by intelligent companies around the globe.</td>
