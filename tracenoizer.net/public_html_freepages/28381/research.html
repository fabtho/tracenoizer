 The Integrated Global Ocean Services System (IGOSS) is the international SYSTEM for the collection and exchange of ocean data (such as temperature and salinity) and the preparation and dissemination of oceanic products and services. IGOSS is coordinated jointly by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), and consists of national facilities and services provided by participating member countries who share data for mutual benefit. In the IOS, naval ships, research vessels, and merchant ships in the Ships-of-Opportunity Programme (SOOP) along with fixed and floating buoys transmit oceanographic data such as subsurface temperature and salinity in near-real time. The IDPSS consists of several types of national, specialized and world data centres for processing and dissemination data and data products. The backbone of the ITA is the Global Telecommunication System (GTS) of the WMO.</td>

 1Jump is a cutting-edge desktop software application. It's not a plug-in, and it's not a browser in the conventional sense. It's a standalone software program designed specifically to help business professionals conduct research on companies. Don't settle for static web-based company directories when you can get interactive, current business information that you can actually use. Locate, compare and contrast companies; instantly copy your findings to your spreadsheet or word processor; create instant customized graphs -- these are just some of the reasons why 1Jump is used by intelligent companies around the globe.</td>
