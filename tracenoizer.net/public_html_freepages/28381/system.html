 , Challenging Institutional Relevancy -- Part I, MIE Journal, Vol. . What and how the system will work in the future are not simple questions to answer. Ultimately the answers to the logistical and operational questions are driven by the values and philosophies of those charged with planning for the future. The purpose of this paper is to provide a framework against which this planning process might proceed.</td>

 A low density eXpendable BathyThermograph (XBT) network, based on the scientific design of the the original TOGA-WOCE network, is becoming operational after the field acquisition phase of WOCE has concluded in 1997. . The Integrated Global Ocean Services System (IGOSS) is the international SYSTEM for the collection and exchange of ocean data (such as temperature and salinity) and the preparation and dissemination of oceanic products and services. IGOSS is coordinated jointly by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), and consists of national facilities and services provided by participating member countries who share data for mutual benefit. In the IOS, naval ships, research vessels, and merchant ships in the Ships-of-Opportunity Programme (SOOP) along with fixed and floating buoys transmit oceanographic data such as subsurface temperature and salinity in near-real time.</td>
