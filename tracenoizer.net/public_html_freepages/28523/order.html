 No matter what anyone tells you, the fundamental tradeoffs engendered by this basic behavior of electrical filters cannot be entirely eliminated in any design. Such tradeoffs can be rendered benign, however, and that's where unconventional filter topologies must be sought. The filter topology that we utilize in all of our speaker systems is know as the Kaminsky fourth order series network. Named after the mathematician who described it, this filter type, provides for both an unusual and highly advantageous set of trade-offs, as well as an unprecedented degree of practicality. We are the only speaker manufacturer in the world to do so.</td>
