 Why the business community is often reluctant to address stress in the workplace. Responsibilities employees must assume in reducing exposure to workplace stress. This was then replaced by a more comprehensive system where teams were given autonomy for continuously monitoring their own systems, with only broad guidelines for minimizing employee stress. Pressure Pointers by David Pearson, CIO, August 1, 1999. A profile of the pressures experienced by IT (information technology) executives and recommendations for handling those pressures.</td>

 If the course is taught in Salt Lake City, various field seminar modules (see below) may be added to the course. The course consists of lectures, exercises, and core description designed to provide the knowledge and skills necessary for the petroleum geologist to work effectively with siliciclastic deposits. The 2-day version of the course covers fundamentals of interpreting siliciclastic depositional systems from well logs and cores, identification of sedimentary structures and depositional facies in cores, and recognition of siliciclastic parasequence and sequence boundaries in well logs and cores. Additional topics may be added as modules and be used to create a customized, but longer, course. .</td>
