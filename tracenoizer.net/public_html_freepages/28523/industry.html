 "In just four years, the Internet has changed the world," said Patrick Duparcq, an assistant professor of management and e-business expert who was a member of the committee that created Krannert's across-the-board approach to e-business. In addition to his Purdue teaching and research, Duparcq teaches e-business marketing at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University and at the Tias Business School at Tilburg University in The Netherlands. He also does e-business consulting with industry and serves on a number of Internet companies' boards of directors. "There is now a significant enough body of research and e-business experience to address the essential strategic questions in a comprehensive fashion," Duparcq said. The new e-business "option," which is essentially an academic minor, is not the Krannert School's first foray into the burgeoning e-business arena.</td>
