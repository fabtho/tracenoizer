 . Failing to fulfill energy delivery obligation may result in penalty to energy suppliers. This paper studies the relationship between generation level schedule, energy delivery schedule and physical ramp-rate of a generating unit. It is shown that although ramp-rate constraints are satisfied in traditional unit commitment problems, taking a generation level schedule as an energy delivery schedule may not be realizable. The admissible region of energy delivery is established in this paper as a set of recursive equations by using the Maximum Principle in optimal control theory.</td>
