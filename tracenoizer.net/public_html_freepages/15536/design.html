 In this fast-paced economy, developing the best solution for storing, protecting and accessing vital corporate information can mean the difference between being a market leader or disastrous loss of business. 6 billion global supplier of integrated circuits for the personal and networked computer and communications markets, is the world's second largest supplier of Microsoft Windows-compatible PC processors. AMD's Microprocessor Design Division (MPD) designs its AMD Athlon processors in Austin, Texas, and Sunnyvale, Calif. The design and simulation of integrated circuits is both compute and storage intensive. The MPD Systems Engineering group has chosen to implement an appliance approach for its IT infrastructure, using dedicated computer systems designed specifically for the task at hand.</td>

 Teachers College, Columbia University has been collaborating with the Dalton School (a K-12 independent school in New York City) on the Dalton Technology Plan. The general aim of this plan is to develop a digital knowledge-base and information infrastructure for all aspects of the K-12 educational experience, and to implement educational strategies designed to make use of this infrastructure, enhancing significantly an already excellent educational experience. In this paper, we describe a framework for SSE design and describe its application to three specific SSEs created as part of the Dalton Technology Plan. After describing the SSEs we report evaluations that demonstrate their effectiveness. The Observation principle is a combination of recommendations by Brown, Collins and Duiguid (1989) and the Cognition and Technology Group at Vanderbilt (1990), but our focus on authentic artifacts is unique.</td>
