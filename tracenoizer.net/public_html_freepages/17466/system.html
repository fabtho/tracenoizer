 As an integral part of this process, the Committee will also work on the development of assessment prototypes for evaluating the achievement of these standards. The intent of this document, and those which will follow, is to stimulate dialogue among the stakeholders of the teaching profession about the best thinking of their colleagues regarding what constitutes competent beginning teaching. Our work is offered to state education agencies and institutions concerned with the professional development of teachers as a resource to revisit state standards for training and licensing new teachers, and to consider ways these models might enhance their system. We invite and encourage your comments on this draft. The draft is being widely circulated to members of the public and the profession as well as the policy making community.</td>

 .About the Curriculum The Information Technology Core Concepts Curriculum The technology that drives corporate information systems continues to change rapidly, particularly as Internet technologies impact on every aspect of business applications. The audience for the Managing Information Systems curriculum is MIS and business managers, as well as new application developers and system administrators who require foundation training on how the corporate IS function is structured, developed, and managed.
