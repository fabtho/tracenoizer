 Evaluating how the standards might be assessed is also part of the task force's future work. We invite your comments now and as the work progresses. This shift toward performance-based standard-setting is in line with the National Board's approach to developing standards and with the changes already occurring in a number of states. This approach should clarify what the criteria are for assessment and licensing, placing more emphasis on the abilities teachers develop than the hours they spend taking classes. Ultimately, performance-based licensing standards should enable states to permit greater innovation and diversity in how teacher education programs operate by assessing their outcomes rather than their inputs or procedures.</td>
