 com IPLITE Many embedded devices have limited resources in terms of memory and CPU power. Available networking solutions are simply too large and slow for such devices. We have used the experience from IPNET - our full featured IPv6 stack for embedded systems - to write a small, robust stack which is yet surprisingly powerful. With a footprint of only some 40 kBytes for a small IPv6 version, it can be used in just about every embedded device. The IPNET stack contains a comprehensive suite of protocols that enables an embedded system to take full advantage of being connected to the Internet.</td>
