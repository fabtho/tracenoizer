 Field events may suffer, too, especially without a high jumper. He hopes his team is improved from last season, and vows they will be competitive. That will be hard without middle distance runners, a triple jumper and depth. The team's strengths are the middle distance races, while the hurdles and long distances are weaknesses. The sprints should be improved this season, and the field events definitely will be better, where the Mustangs barely scored any points last season.</td>

 It's a window onto homelessness that allows you to make your own decisions. So I had to adapt my views to fit the reality of what I was encountering. Many of their problems are individual issues, but it's hard to separate the two. If you're the one with the problem maybe a mental disability as subtle as a bad attitude - you're the one who sits out. There's less housing, less welfare, so the losers nowadays lose big.</td>
