 As a result, an act of the 1946 Louisiana Legislature provided funds to purchase and build facilities for the Red River Valley Agricultural Experiment Station on 573 acres south of Bossier City, LA. The Caddo and Bossier Parish police juries provided supplemental funds for the station, and in 1947 the station became a reality. In 1983, the station was renamed the Red River Research Station. It is one of 17 branch locations of the Louisiana Agricultural Experiment Station, which is the research arm of the LSU Agricultural Center. .</td>
