 Designing and manufacturing our own sailcloth has become a key part of North's sails and is a significant advantage that we offer to our customers. . Sailcloth as Part of the North System Home News Articles Gallery Contacts Links Sailcloth as Part of the North System By Peter Mahr Good sailcloth is essential to a successful sail and North has recognised this since its very beginnings. Lowell North, founder and University of California trained engineer, was a pioneer in understanding sailcloth from a technical standpoint. His interest and technical direction lead to the creation of North Cloth, the group that researches designs and produces sailcloth exclusively for the North companies world-wide.</td>

 edu Last Modified on 25 April, 2002 by Nancy Rehak . . THOR North System Information THOR-North System Information The RAP portion of the THOR-North project is a fairly large deployment of both the NCWF (National Convective Weather Forecast) and Auto-Nowcaster systems on areas in the NorthEast corridor of the US. The NCWF portion of the system is being called RCWF (Regional Convective Weather Forecast) because it is being run on lower resolution data from just this corridor. The Auto-Nowaster portion of the system (which I usually just call the Nowcaster) will be run on 2 of the radars in the corridor.</td>
