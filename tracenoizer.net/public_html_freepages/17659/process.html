<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" Consumers in the Hihn Road and Zayante areas, from time to time, may experience periods of discolored water caused by iron and manganese. As water comes in contact with chlorine at the well head and with oxygen during the trip through the mainline distribution piping, the iron and manganese precipitate deposits in the water mains. The District adds a polyphosphate chemical to slow down this process. However, this is not totally effective and some deposition still occurs. Occasionally, during higher flows, the deposits become dislodged resulting in discolored water.">

 The clarifiers have a "stacked" settling surface at mid-depth to double the settling capacity of the tanks that are squeezed into the tight space confines of Deer Island. SECONDARY TREATMENT Secondary treatment mixers, reactors and clarifiers remove non-settleable solids through biological and gravity treatment. The biological process is a pure oxygen-activated sludge system, using microorganisms to consume organic matter that remains in the wastewater flow. The first and second of three "batteries" of secondary treatment were completed in 1997 and 1998. The third battery of secondary treatment will be operational by Fall 2000.</td>

 National Archives - Rocky Mountain Region The Rocky Mountain region of the National Archives has submitted over 4,000 documents to be digitized to the National Archives in Washington, D. The National Cable Television Center and Museum, The Barco Library The collections include a large archive of historic information relating to the beginnings and huge growth of the industry. A major component of this process includes the creation of finding aids and digitization of key parts of the collections. Pikes Peak Hill Climb Museum Digitized images from the museum's collections have been scanned and mounted on the website. Images include photographs from the "Race to the Clouds" and the "Pikes Peak International Hill Climb.</td>
