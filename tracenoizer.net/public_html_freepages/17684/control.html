 Gibb apparently came up with the name "ping pong," representing the sounds of the ball hitting the paddle and then the table. Goode, in 1902 covered his wooden ping pong paddle with pebbled rubber, which allowed him to put spin on the ball. A Ping Pong Association was founded in England that year, but it lasted less than three years, mainly because Parker Brothers' control of the name made equipment rather expensive. Nevertheless, the sport spread rather quietly in England and Europe, primarily with equipment marketed by other manufacturers using the generic name of table tennis. A new Table Tennis Association was established in England in 1921.</td>

 It appears that under adverse environmental conditions mite populations are slow to build through the later part of summer. We plan to continue this study to hopefully observe mite buildup under more favorable conditions. Determine wheat curl mite survival and wheat streak risk from chemical and mechanical volunteer control. A study was conducted in 1994 to determine the impact of herbicides (Roundup and Cyclone) and tillage (disc and blade plow) on mite populations and subsequent ability to transmit virus to adjacent wheat planting. Plots were established in areas of moderate mite populations, and on the date that the volunteer was controlled wheat was planted adjacent to the plots.</td>

 Corals grow, adding structure to a reef over millions of years. Then conditions change, and eroding organisms and forces get the upper hand. The Greenpeace report on the future of the Great Barrier Reef plugs into some of humanity's deepest fears loss of control, the extinction of human and other species. The human species may be contributing to changing the planet so we will no longer be pre- dominant. We are in the process of creating our own more capable successors and whether these will be the super-rat, the cyborg, or forms of coral life without zooxanthellae only time will tell.</td>
