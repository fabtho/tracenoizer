 Although color appearance is still an active research topic, the most common forms of adaptation are understood reasonably well, so that the required corrections in the colorimetry for different viewing conditions can be modeled with sufficient accuracy. There are other reasons why the colorimetry may be altered for specific media. For instance, hard-copy media--even those intended for the same viewing conditions--differ considerably in their dynamic range and color gamut. A well-crafted rendering of an image on a specific medium will take advantage of the capabilities of that medium without creating objectionable artifacts imposed by its limitations. For instance, the tone reproduction of the image should provide sufficient contrast in the midtones without producing blocked-up shadows or washed-out highlights.</td>
