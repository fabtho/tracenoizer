 The author(s) of this document and the organizers of the conference have granted their consent to include this abstract in Atlas Conferences Inc. . Conference Homepage Ladder Systems on Trees presented by Zoran Spasojevic Massachusetts Institute of Technology We formulate the notion of uniformization of colorings of ladder systems on subsets of trees. We prove that Suslin trees have this property and also Aronszajn trees in the presence of Martin's Axiom. As an application we show that if a tree has this property then every countable discrete family of subsets of the tree can be separated by a family of pairwise disjoint open sets.</td>
