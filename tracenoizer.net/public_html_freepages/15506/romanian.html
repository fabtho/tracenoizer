 There are hundreds of places in Romania which are worth seeing. We cannot list all of them, but we offer you a selection in the To See In Draculand page. We have included an Other Links page; here you can start to explore the Romanian web (you will find some Romanian directories and also a collection of websites about travelling in Romania, including Dracula tours). You can take a look on the FAQ page and if the answer you are looking for is not there please Contact us by e-mail. Here you will find a lot of explanations about the history of the Castle, its floorplans, and many photos.</td>
