 . Effective Flow Analysis for Avoiding Run-Time Checks - Jagannathan, Wright (ResearchIndex) A. This paper describes a general purpose program analysis that computes global control-flow and data-flow information for higher-order, call-by-value programs. This information can be used to drive global program optimizations such as inlining and run-time check elimination, as well as optimizations like constant folding and loop invariant code motion that are typically based on special-purpose local analyses. The analysis employs a novel approximation technique called polymorphic splitting that uses let-expressions as syntactic clues to gain precision.</td>

 " Full Story Galileo Millennium Mission Status NASA has repeatedly extended Galileo's original two-year mission in orbit. The spacecraft is now nearly out of the hydrazine propellant needed to keep its antenna pointed toward Earth. Knowing they would eventually lose contact and control of the spacecraft, the Galileo team chose the planned impact with Jupiter to ensure there was no chance the spacecraft might hit Europa. One of Galileo's important discoveries has been the likelihood of a melted saltwater ocean under Europa's icy crust, making that moon of great interest for future study of the possibility of extraterrestrial life. Full Story Galileo Millennium Mission Status While approaching Jupiter's moon Io on Thursday, during the seventh year of its mission around Jupiter, NASA's Galileo spacecraft placed itself into standby mode, awaiting further commands from Earth.</td>
