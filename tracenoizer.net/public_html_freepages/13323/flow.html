 html Any questions or comments contact- Gerry Wieczorek . .gov DISCLAIMER Volumetric calculations indicate that the Kinsey Run debris flow deposited or redistributed approximately 5. 7 x 104 m3 of very poorly sorted debris to a maxium depth of 1. Wet antecedent conditions also contributed to the triggering of the Kinsey Run debris flow which failed as a landslide 2.</td>
