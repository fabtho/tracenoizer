 Examples of the benefits is using TOP are given in tobacco product retailing, fabric printing manufacturing and food packaging. He describes ways to overcome these problems using technology and, in particular, he stresses the importance of the web. A Mitsubishi manager gives a guide to developing closer links between business systems, including the web, and shop floor control and scheduling systems thus improving the ability to deliver the right things to the right people at the right time. This article reports on a forum on collaboration organised by the magazine 'Manufacturing Computer Solutions' in 2001. The goal was to examine the kind of investment and internal effort required, the vendor acronyms and the extent to which manufacturing users are willing to collaborate.</td>

 This information can be used to drive global program optimizations such as inlining and run-time check elimination, as well as optimizations like constant folding and loop invariant code motion that are typically based on special-purpose local analyses. The analysis employs a novel approximation technique called polymorphic splitting that uses let-expressions as syntactic clues to gain precision. Polymorphic splitting borrows ideas from Hindley-Milner polymorphic type inference systems to create an analog to polymorphism for flow. Surprisingly, even analyses used in compilers for typed languages ignore type. Effective flow analysis for avoiding run-time checks.</td>
