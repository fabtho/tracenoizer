Since an icebreaker keeps normal strength increases until the end of the encounter with the ice, you should only have to do this once per piece of ice regardless of the number of subroutines it has. If any subroutine ends the run, the run is ended before later subroutines take effect. If ending the run is part of a subroutine, that whole subroutine will affect the Runner before it ends the run. Choose the order in which you want to access the cards there, including face-down cards.">
