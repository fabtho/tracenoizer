 Our laboratory has the capability to run many advanced flow cytometry applications. Also, any particle in suspension that is greater than . The facility has acquired a magnetic cell separation system (autoMACS). By using this system, large numbers of cells can be sorted for a single cell surface marker with high purity in a short period of time. The Flow Cytometry lab is open to all MIT and Whitehead researchers.</td>
