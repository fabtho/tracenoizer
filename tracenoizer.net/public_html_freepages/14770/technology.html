 The companies are joining their respective technologies to provide marketing campaigns on the Web based on the use of database intelligence. Teradata also is exploring a possible alliance with Visible World, a marketing company that specializes in cable television, to offer a similar service in that medium, Teradata director of e-marketing Dave Schrader told CRMDaily. Marrying Technology The integration will allow the front-end customer-touching systems of Broadvision -- such as its one-to-one enterprise and content management applications -- to work in tandem with Teradata's back-end marketing intelligence system, including its data warehouse, e-business analytics and CRM applications. "The front-end uploads the information into the data warehouse, which is the brains behind the scenes, coordinating the data from all the channels so whatever happens on the Web is immediately known to the other channels and vice versa," Schrader said. For example, a customer who speaks to a service rep about an account can then log on and view his account information.</td>

 Software that protects children from inappropriate Internet content is an early example of this shift. Technological protections for personal and business communications privacy are not far behind. Other problems technology will be called upon to solve include managing unsolicited e-mail, assuring the cyberspace equivalent of political free speech, and assuring the integrity of public information and historical records. Changes for the Better The long-term effects of the changes we are witnessing, on balance, will be for the better, although such a view comes more from personal optimism than experience. Social forms and conventions that in these early days may be enabled or bolstered by technology may in time be finely woven into the fabric of society.</td>
