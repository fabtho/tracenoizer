 In order to improve the dynamic behaviour of the resulting nonlinear control system, we not only apply conventional 2D-cameras but also a laser-based 3D-camera (see Figure 2). In addition to a 2D grey-scale image, this camera provides a measurement of the distance between camera and objects at each image dot. The conversion of such an instruction into a real trip can be difficult (one may think of the problem of parking a car) and is therefore controlled by a specific underlying system. The nonlinear and non-holonomic characteristics of the wheelchari are fully taken into account. The algorithms were successfully implemented at the wheelchair system and were also taken into operation at a mobile assembly platform at DaimlerChrysler Aerospace,Bremen, Germany.</td>
