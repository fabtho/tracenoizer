 . THE INTERNATIONAL NEWSLETTER FOR THOSE FIGHTING OVARIAN CANCER. EASY SYSTEM FOR HANDLING HEALTH CARE CLAIM PAPERWORK Here is a simple, yet effective system for handling and tracking a multitude of health care claims. While it sounds quite complicated, it is really easy to set up and maintain. The advantage of this system is that it makes it easy to track what is happening and when, keeps all the paper work together, and helps tremendously when income tax time comes.</td>

 From this, the control input signals to the motors of the wheelchair are generated (Fig. Different to classical approaches, neither absolute measurement nor a comparison to maps is carried out. In order to improve the dynamic behaviour of the resulting nonlinear control system, we not only apply conventional 2D-cameras but also a laser-based 3D-camera (see Figure 2). In addition to a 2D grey-scale image, this camera provides a measurement of the distance between camera and objects at each image dot. The conversion of such an instruction into a real trip can be difficult (one may think of the problem of parking a car) and is therefore controlled by a specific underlying system.</td>
