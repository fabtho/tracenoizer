1 POLICY The University recognizes that employees may make contributions to the University outside of their primary assignment roles. However, University employees must be cognizant of their primary responsibilities within their administrative departments. Extra-service opportunities outside of primary assignment roles are a rare privilege granted at the University's discretion to benefit the University and for the professional development of the individual. Employees may provide services to the University, either with or without compensation beyond their primary roles, if such services do not interfere or conflict with their primary role assignments. There are two categories of extra-service which employees may perform with appropriate supervisory approval.</td>

It allows you to build your complete shop before you buy. No need to trust our claims - click here to put them to the test.</td>
