 A hundred-word item buried in The New York Times of June 14, 1976, cites an official U. or the Laotian Government could supply photographic evidence, but this would not satisfy the needs of current propaganda. The response to the three books under review nicely illustrates this selection process. Hildebrand and Porter present a carefully documented study of the destructive American impact on Cambodia and the success of the Cambodian revolutionaries in overcoming it, giving a very favorable picture of their programs and policies, based on a wide range of sources. They also claim to have analysed radio and refugee reports.</td>

 I like that spinning Icon thing that's on the main page. I was in the Reserves for 25 years and was looking for some information for my daughter when I ran across your page. I am in the process of putting together a web page and was wondering how to do it. After looking at many pages I thought I would give asking you. You can also follow the link here and view picture's from renaissance faires all over the country.</td>

 . The wood preserving operation used creosote as a preservative up until 1966, then changed to pentachlorophenol (PCP). From 1966 to 1973, the site used a process that allowed approximately 72,000 gallons of PCP to drip from treated wood directly onto the ground. In addition, approximately 3,200 gallons of PCP-contaminated sludge were applied directly to the ground. The site is partially fenced and located in a rural area.</td>
