 In order to explain this, we can use another concept, introduced by Cecelia Tichi (1991) and Lynn Spigel (1992), two scholars of television. It is a metaphor illustrating American television in the 1940's and 1950's. It refers to a theme or style to present the television set as the key element in keeping the nuclear family together. The tv set had an effect similar to the fireplace in the age of the American frontier. A similar idea of the electronic hearth can be traced to later technical innovations connected to tv, such as television arcade games, home computers or Internet televisions.</td>
