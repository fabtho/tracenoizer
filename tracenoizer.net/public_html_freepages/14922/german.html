 suggest an article topic The Handbook of Texas Online is a joint project of The General Libraries at the University of Texas at Austin and the Texas State Historical Association. . The earliest reference to music among Texas German immigrants dates from 1834, when the elder Robert Justus Klebergqv imported a piano and music books to Harrisburg. In 1837 Mary Austin Holleyqv enjoyed the informal singing of some Germans on a boat trip between Galveston and Houston. With colonization by the Adelsvereinqv after 1844, German music began to flourish, and German musicians became more influential, even in the centers whose population was not primarily German.</td>

 General Sutter, as he was generally known, was forced to flee his creditors in Switzerland at the age of 30. After the discovery of gold on ihs land he lost everything. More has been written about Sutter than about any other German-American (Sutter himself usually claimed to be German-Swiss). After decades of obscurity, several books about his life were published. The first of these, Blaise Cendrars "L'or; la merveilleuse histoire du general Johann August Sutter," appeared in 1925 and was a distorted biography that became the source for numerous subsequent literary treatments in German of Sutter's life.</td>
