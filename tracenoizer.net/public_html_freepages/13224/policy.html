 EDT (2207 GMT) WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The White House may be backing away from its previous support for using the long arm of the federal government to restrict access to indecent material on the Internet, according to a report in Monday's New York Times. Senior administration officials now believe that the Communications Decency Act of 1996, which provides criminal penalties for distributing such material electronically, will not survive a current challenge before the U. So some in the administration have been fashioning a new policy that would leave the online world substantially self-regulated -- discarding the use of government sanctions at the heart of the decency act, the Times said. The most recent draft of the new policy states that "unnecessary regulation or censorship could cripple the growth and diversity of the Internet. " Clinton has not signed off on new policy President Bill Clinton has not signed off on the self-regulation concept, which is not likely to be announced prior to the Supreme Court's final ruling.</td>
