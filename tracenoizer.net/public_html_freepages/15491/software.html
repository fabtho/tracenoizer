 Initial testing has shown this method to work adequately for most databases. This service is only available to Carnegie Mellon University affiliates, and therefore you must authenticate (reliably identify) yourself to the web server. The method in place for doing this is the KWeb software. Your web browser must have Java, JavaScript and Cookies enabled for authentication to function, allowing you to access the proxy server using KWeb. Java, JavaScript and Cookies must be enabled for the applet to run and authentication to function.</td>

 In particular, the treatment of different image data sets in multiple combinations with optimum degree of geometric accuracy is required for the exact geographic location of individual ground features, especially in mountainous regions. Moreover, multisensor remote sensing data have to be made available to be used in geographic information systems or environmental monitoring systems. Hence, based on many years of research in the field of remote sensing, the Institute for Digital Image Processing of JOANNEUM RESEARCH has developed RSG - the Remote Sensing software package Graz. The RSG software package is designed as comprehensive and versatile as possible for geometric processing and quality assessment of digital multisensor remote sensing data. RSG may be considered as a geometric processing tool box for remote sensing image data (see picture).</td>

 He is also Chair of the WebDAV Working Group of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), which is developing interoperability standards for remote collaborative authoring of content on the Web. . Henry's research interests are in software architecture and architectural testing; specifically, in testing of software subsystems integration against a software architecture specification. Alex Metherell is a Research Specialist working on his primary research interest of muscle biophysics. He is specifically interested in the mechanism by which muscle generates force and contracts.</td>
