Assess the adequacy and accuracy of the Marini and Murray model for SLR at the 1 mm level, for all elevations above 15 degrees and all wavelengths from 355 nm to 1570 nm and perhaps beyond. Prepare a formal recommendation to the ILRS, including a standard algorithm and set of recommended practices, for adoption by the stations and analysis centres. If this report indicates that revision is necessary, present a formal recommendation to ILRS at the ILRS Governing Board meeting subsequent to the Matera meeting. It might be desirable to extend the region of applicability to elevations lower than 15 degrees.">
