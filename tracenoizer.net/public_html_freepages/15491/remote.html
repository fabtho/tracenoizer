In particular, the treatment of different image data sets in multiple combinations with optimum degree of geometric accuracy is required for the exact geographic location of individual ground features, especially in mountainous regions. Moreover, multisensor remote sensing data have to be made available to be used in geographic information systems or environmental monitoring systems. Hence, based on many years of research in the field of remote sensing, the Institute for Digital Image Processing of JOANNEUM RESEARCH has developed RSG - the Remote Sensing software package Graz. The RSG software package is designed as comprehensive and versatile as possible for geometric processing and quality assessment of digital multisensor remote sensing data.">

 To get one, come to any UCSD Library with your valid UCSD photo ID and fill out a registration form. . All remote, off-campus users must be authenticated so that only currently affiliated people are given access to licensed resources. (With very few exceptions, anyone can search these same resources at computers in the campus libraries. ) UCSD Internet accounts are authenticated for remote access by automatic detection of the Internet (IP) address of the connecting computer.</td>
