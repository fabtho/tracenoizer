 . If your hardware is determined to be malfunctioning, you will be directed to an In-Lab service offering. The only service of its kind in the world Remote Data Recovery technology lets us perform lab-quality data recovery right on your server, desktop, or laptop through a modem or Internet connection. There is no need to remove the drive or dismantle your system. Faster, easier and less expensive A typical in-lab recovery takes about 2-5 days - RDR can be completed in a matter of hours.</td>

 The group also designs proprietary, Windows-based software to enable end-users to access and manipulate ISI publication and citation data with maximum power and flexibility. . The data provided by the Research Services Group is based on the bibliographic and citation information that ISI collects from its multidisciplinary database of thousands of influential, peer-reviewed journals. The Research Services Group maintains a file of publication and citation data spanning 1981 to 2001 that is specially structured in a relational database format for bibliometric analysis. It is multidisciplinary in scope and exhaustive in coverage of bibliographic information and citation counts (essential measures of research influence and impact).</td>

 RSG may be considered as a geometric processing tool box for remote sensing image data (see picture). . In particular, the treatment of different image data sets in multiple combinations with optimum degree of geometric accuracy is required for the exact geographic location of individual ground features, especially in mountainous regions. Moreover, multisensor remote sensing data have to be made available to be used in geographic information systems or environmental monitoring systems. Hence, based on many years of research in the field of remote sensing, the Institute for Digital Image Processing of JOANNEUM RESEARCH has developed RSG - the Remote Sensing software package Graz.</td>
