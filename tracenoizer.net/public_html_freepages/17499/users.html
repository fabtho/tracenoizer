 To use anonymous CVS to access the DHCP distribution, you must first "log in". You should only need to do this once, but it is a necessary step, even though access is anonymous. Anonymous users log in as user "nobody", password "nobody". If you get some kind of error indicating that CVS doesn't know how to log you in, you are probably running an old version of CVS, and should upgrade. Once you have logged in, you can check out a version of the DHCP distribution, so the next question is, which version.</td>

 This book was used when installing my home version of Linux and is excellent for this purpose. It also contains a very significant chapter on Samba - a networking application which allows Linux to act as a fileserver for Windows9x PCs. org) especially the Linux Users Guide, the System Administrators Guide and the Network Administrators Guide. The importance of further reading I cannot stress enough the importance of the research to the outcome of the overall project. There are many phrases and anecdotes which accurately summarise this, including "forewarned is forearmed" and the five P's (proper preparation prevents poor performance).</td>
