 X Success Success specifies that the DSN is reporting a positive delivery action. Detail sub-codes may provide notification of transformations required for delivery. X Persistent Transient Failure A persistent transient failure is one in which the message as sent is valid, but some temporary event prevents the successful sending of the message. X Permanent Failure A permanent failure is one which is not likely to be resolved by resending the message in the current form. Some change to the message or the destination must be made for successful delivery.</td>

 Many viewers won't know Hubbard's biography, so Powers' resemblance and the details Alexander offers about impotence, devil worship and other lurid topics -- whether they're true or imagined -- feel like cheap shots at a dead man. Interesting from an exploitation-movie point of view, but not appropriate for the informative warning Alexander purports his movie to be. Yet, so much publicized material about Hubbard and Scientology creeps into the picture -- IRS hassles, FBI infiltration, military uniforms and sci-fi theology -- that whatever fictional leaps Alexander makes undermine the film's message. The movie keeps us interested, making the connections between headlines and celluloid, but sometimes feels far-fetched. The Profit would make a stronger statement if Alexander used his Scientology experience to produce a documentary or a no-holds-barred version of Hubbard's life that calls him Hubbard.</td>
