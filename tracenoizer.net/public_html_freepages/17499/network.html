 Last month I described the inner workings of aglets, this month I'll discuss the ways in which mobile agent technologies, such as aglets, might fit into the Java developer's toolbox. (For more information, see Bret Sommers's explanation of agents. ) As used here, a software agent is a program that can halt itself, ship itself to another computer on the network, and continue execution at the new computer. The key feature of this kind of software agent is that both its code and state are mobile. Aglets are autonomous because once you start them, they decide where they will go and what they will do.</td>

 The Linux Option Linux is a Unix clone and as such the incorporates the excellent netwroking abilities of the latter. It is this trait (among others) which has lead to its' increasing deployment in the Internet server market. It could provide a low cost replacement strategy for the problem at hand and yet allow for the expected network growth at little or no extra cost. That Linux was an effective and cost-effective server solution was not in question but we need to know whether it could provide a specific solution in this case. Could Linux fulfill all the roles provided by the current serverPC, including file-serving, internal mail, network faxing and Internet mail redistribution.</td>
