Whereas mobile code usually travels just from point A to point B, mobile agents have an itinerary and can travel sequentially to many sites. One natural application of mobile agents, therefore, is collecting information spread across many computers hooked to a network. An example of this kind of application is a network backup tool that periodically must look at every disk attached to every computer hooked to a network. Here, a mobile agent could roam the network, collecting information about the backup status of each disk.">
