 Building RTAI into your kernel is then a matter of clicking the appropriate selection in the Target Wizard and rebuilding the system. Of course, users should be aware that upgrading to a new kernel version would require first applying the RTAI kernel patch. Lineo has also provided a good manual for RTAI (the longest manual of the set) that makes a valiant effort to impose order on the disparate components of the subsystem. One cannot help but admire the tech writer who put the best face on a manual that required everything from a short introduction to pthreads to the description of Perl bindings for a hard real-time system. In the end, however, there is no shortcut to using RTAI -- you have to invest some time into its use, and you should not look for an overarching philosophy behind it.</td>
