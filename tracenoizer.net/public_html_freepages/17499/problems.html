Such arrangements will form and reform as problems arise so providing a flexibility of response to changing circumstances and organisational needs.

 Right now it doesn't even have an engine, but someday it will be my car. This is a place I feel at home, more than in my own bed. After 15 minutes, I began to realize I don't have real problems. My problem was I had too much stuff to fit into a fairly large room, and so I wanted to move my brother out. There are people who have no space they can call their own.</td>

 The system ran fine for about three weeks, at which point I received a phone call from the customer. They had lost the system disk and had called our hardware support person, who replaced the disk in accordance with the support contract. In trying to rebuild the machine, the customer was having problems remembering what went where and how to get all the data back on the other drives. This is not an unusual situation but the customer had been trying to do this for four days before calling us. Within two hours of my getting there, the customer saw the light as to why I had used the much maligned NTBACKUP.</td>
