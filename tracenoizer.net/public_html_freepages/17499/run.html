 In all of the following command examples, we assume that you have cd'd to the top of the source tree. Building the Tree So, you now have a copy of the code. The run make, make necesary changes, and make install. All the modified versions of file are directly copied to run-time locations, and not left to source directories. Code Updates From time to time, the coders will make changes to the CVS repository.</td>

 If you used a version tag, it won't do anything (see above). After updating the local source directory, it is usually enough to issue make to rebuild everything. It is safe to manually run aclocal, automake and autoconf if you think something should be rebuilt, but this sould be run automatically on make. Starting a Project Discuss your ideas on the workers list before you start. Someone may be working on the same thing you have in mind.</td>

 Download source code The latest released source code sets are listed below, and are guaranteed to compile and work. However, they do not contain the latest code and will always lag the leading edge development to some degree. Please download source code only if you are prepared to work out how to compile and run the code. Instructions on how to compile the code are on this site 3. Get source code from the OpenH323 CVS archive This option is for the truly brave, or foolhardy.</td>
