<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" Prequalification of consumers for home-purchase loans is becoming more commonplace. Lenders have moved to risk-based pricing, and thus fair-lending analysis has shifted from a primary focus on loan denials to scrutiny of loan pricing, particularly of higher-priced loans. The amendments published last month are intended to improve the consistency and the quality of data collected on home mortgage loans. In a changing market, such consistency and quality will help ensure the continued utility of the data. These changes are intended to obtain more complete and consistent data about a financial institution's home mortgage lending.">

 The system ran fine for about three weeks, at which point I received a phone call from the customer. They had lost the system disk and had called our hardware support person, who replaced the disk in accordance with the support contract. In trying to rebuild the machine, the customer was having problems remembering what went where and how to get all the data back on the other drives. This is not an unusual situation but the customer had been trying to do this for four days before calling us. Within two hours of my getting there, the customer saw the light as to why I had used the much maligned NTBACKUP.</td>

 In addition, the exemplary practices offer a standard and a challenge for ombudsman programs in terms of higher levels of effectiveness and service. The committee recommends that the Administration on Aging build upon the committee's proposed set of exemplary, essential, and unacceptable practices to develop and implement an objective method to assess compliance of state long-term care ombudsman programs. Data and Information Systems As noted above, because the ombudsman program is still developing and evolving, and because data on program performance are not available, evaluating the program's effectiveness in any comprehensive way is not possible. Agreement has been lacking about the definition of goals. Implementation has been extremely varied, in part because of broad and uneven interpretations of the OAA mandate.</td>
