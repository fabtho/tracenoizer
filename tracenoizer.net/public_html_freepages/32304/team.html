 I also agree with Duck, everyone should make an effort to use it as our most reliable form of communication. . I found out about it just because the other team started showing up and I was there with a few other Clan members. The only problem was we were lacking Clan members because it was sort of an impromptu invitation. Needless to say it was difficult to put on a good showing with a handful of our group and a bunch of players we'd never played with and who had poor to medium skill levels.</td>
