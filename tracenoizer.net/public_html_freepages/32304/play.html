 Also my mummy is having a baby, so I am going to have a brother. They have got a little player called raspberry ripple from Spain and a really good player from New Zealund called Bruce Waverama. New Zealund rugby players do this scary dance called a hakakakakaka before they play where they stick their tongues out and say hatch-at-tat-tat-tah. Anyway Bruce is dead good at the hakakakakaka acuzz he was on the telly doing it at the commun welf games. Uncle Keef and Smudger has promise us at least one more big player.</td>
