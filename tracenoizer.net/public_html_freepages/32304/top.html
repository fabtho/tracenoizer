 During the league we never lost a match all season right up until the end and this also included our clanbase results and many of our friendlies. Throughout this success we still held our good nature and friendliness in high esteem and continued to be a very nice clan, something to be proud of. The league was a really good challenge as we finished top of our group, culminating in a fine win over Rasta, probably our best performance upto that point. One of the most exciting times in NKN was that final group match and then the play-offs. I was watching the matchbot in IRC along with some 50 others and I have never been so nervous in my life about a game, the feeling was amazing.</td>

 Well, inevitably college costs enter the discussion. (Believe me, Connor is just 5 months old and it's a hot topic. Four top NY agents visit Kathy Wickline Casting to meet the actors (that are pre-qualified) and ready to expand to the NY market. The open call will remain the first Wednesday of each month from 2-4 PM. But, you must first call in to reserve an audition spot.</td>
