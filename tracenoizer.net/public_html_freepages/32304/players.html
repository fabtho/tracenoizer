 I found out about it just because the other team started showing up and I was there with a few other Clan members. The only problem was we were lacking Clan members because it was sort of an impromptu invitation. Needless to say it was difficult to put on a good showing with a handful of our group and a bunch of players we'd never played with and who had poor to medium skill levels. I check this board before I log onto either server just so I don't miss anything. Maybe we could keep each other better informed if everyone did this.</td>

 Instead of this you can also use Roger Wilko (a voice chat program), but that's on the one hand a way of cheating since you can tell your friend where the enemy is when you are dead and on the other hand it doesn't always work in TO. Now you've configured your TO nicely let's head on to the actual game. Find a server with a nice ping and a good amount of players. If there's one player dominating the rest it's very likely to be a newbie server and you don't want that. Try looking for a server with players you know or a server with a somehow balanced score.</td>
