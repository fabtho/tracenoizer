 cdc68 mutations also allow expression of core promoters lacking UASs. At a genetic level, therefore, Cdc68 activates and represses gene expression. Altered histone gene expression, and resultant changes in histone stoichiometry, can also derepress core promoters and exert an spt- phenotype through effects on chromatin structure. A cdc68 mutation affects expression from the HTA1-HTB1 locus that encodes histones H2A and H2B, raising the possibility that repression of core promoters is a reflection of Cdc68 effects on histone expression. To test this we measured mRNA abundance in cdc68 mutant cells under conditions that preclude histone gene expression.</td>
