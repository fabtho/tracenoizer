 The high ceiling is barely visible in the gloom, and you can hear the sound of your bare feet slapping cold marble. I can barely see the high ceiling through the gloom, and I can hear the sound of my bare feet slapping cold marble. You'd thus be commanding this sort of roving presence in the game, who reports back what he or she sees. The character could be completely obedient or maybe partly autonomous. I think it's interesting and certainly makes a change from the traditional text IF style, although I don't know if it would really fit the game I'm working on.</td>

 CBS "eye device" is a registered trademark of CBS Inc. .com wire reports CINCINNATI -- A California kid who had never played in snow and a rookie kicker who had never made a game-winner decided one of the coldest games in Cincinnati Bengals history. Danny Farmer caught three long passes in a tying touchdown drive and Neil Rackers made a 27-yard field goal as time ran out, rallying the Bengals to a 17-14 a victory over the Jaguars on Sunday on a field as nasty as the weather. "It was cold and miserable, and we all had to deal with it," said Bengals running back Corey Dillon, who lost two fumbles.</td>
