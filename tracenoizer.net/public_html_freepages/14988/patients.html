<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" People with a certain genetic variant are only half as likely to suffer them after taking diuretic drugs, suggests their research. Raised blood pressure, or hypertension, over a long period of time increases the chance of hardened arteries, which in turn can contribute to heart attacks or strokes. Patients with the problem are often given various drugs to reduce the problem, including diuretics. These drugs work by forcing the kidney to get rid of excess salt, which is a well-known contributor to high blood pressure. Despite these treatments, some people still go on to have serious health problems.">

 USING YOUR OWN BLOOD -- AUTOLOGOUS DONATION Using your own blood can minimize the need for transfusion with donor blood. Using your own blood will reduce, but not eliminate, the risk of transfusion-related infections and allergic reactions. Autologous blood donations are not an option for all patients. You may want to ask your doctor if it is safe for you to donate. Autologous blood collections may not be available at the hospital in which your surgery will be performed.</td>
