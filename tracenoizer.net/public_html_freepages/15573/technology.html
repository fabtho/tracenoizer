To remain competitive in today's challenging business environment, many high tech companies acquire other companies with high intrinsic value and low asset cost bases. A significant part of their intangible assets may also include technology products under development or in process. This helps establish the criteria for reaching technological feasibility, the relationship of technologies to products, and whether any acquired technologies has alternative use or value beyond the current project. Technology is grounded in a knowledge of what works and what doesn't, applied to meeting specific requirements in the development of products.</td>

 During fiscal year 2001, substantially all of the goodwill and acquired intangibles related to the purchase of Stratus were written off as part of our restructuring program, which resulted in the exit of all but two of the remaining projects within the original portfolio. . As part of the process of analyzing each of these acquisitions, we made a decision to buy technology that had not yet been commercialized rather than develop the technology internally. We based this decision on a number of factors including the amount of time it would take to bring the technology to market. We also considered Bell Labs' resource allocation and its progress on comparable technology, if any.</td>

 The mandate of this company is to continue the research and development work carried on by this division of ORTECH Corporation for the past 70 years, and to explore innovative solutions in this area to better serve the needs of Canadian industries as well as international companies. Process Research ORTECH (PRO) is now a privately owned organization serving mining, metallurgical, recycling and chemical industries for more than seventy years. In addition to developing its own technology, PRO remains connected to the cutting edge of new and innovative technologies which have promise for its potential clients. This includes the TorbedTM technology for carrying fast reactions at medium to high temperatures and the Tetra technology for production of high density solids. The testing equipment for these technologies exists directly at its facility.</td>
