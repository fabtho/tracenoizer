 The SSDA includes also public domain data of some non-Russian planetary missions of interest for Russian users. . Solar System Data Archive Home Page Solar System Data Archive Solar System Data Archive (SSDA) archives the data collected by various Russian missions devoted to study of planets and small bodies in Solar system. The data from the solar-terrestrial missions are contained in the separate Solar-Terrestrial Data Archive. Telemetry data are grouped according to project name.</td>

 If you are a member of the planetary science community, please take a moment to complete the PDS Survey. . Planetary Data System Home The Planetary Data System (PDS) archives and distributes scientific data from NASA planetary missions, astronomical observations, and laboratory measurements. The PDS is sponsored by NASA's Office of Space Science. Its purpose is to ensure the long-term usability of NASA data and to stimulate advanced research.</td>

 The injury rate per 100 million vehicle miles of travel decreased by 0. . FARS Web-Based Encyclopedia Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) Web-Based Encyclopedia NHTSA decided in 1996 to make FARS data easier to obtain by using Internet technology. This FARS Web-Based Encyclopedia offers a more intuitive and powerful approach for retrieving fatal crash information. The injury rate per 100 million vehicle miles of travel decreased by 0.</td>
