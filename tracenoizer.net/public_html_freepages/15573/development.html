 and 4 years of industrial experience in the fields of antimicrobial discovery or oncology. . Candidates must have demonstrated their expertise for assay development (in vitro biochemical and cell based) and protein purification. The successful candidate will join a multidisciplinary department responsible for the development and prosecution of primary and secondary screening assays for the identification of novel antimicrobial drugs. Familiarity with automated workstations, FPLC, integrated robotics, relational databases and data analysis software is essential.</td>
