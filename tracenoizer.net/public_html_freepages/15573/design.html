 Future work on LevDesigner is expected to produce a behavioral synthesis tool operating over specification models common to LevChecker and LevBencher. . LEVETATE's mission is to raise hardware design focus to higher levels of abstraction through the research, development, and marketing of specification-based design tools. As depicted in the following figure, this activity progresses through three distinct phases that increase the level of design automation and rigor over today's labor-intensive simulation methods. The first step employs formal specifications written in the LEVETATE-developed Versatile Interface Language (VIL).</td>

 Future process programs are planned to support the entire software lifecycle, including configuration management, managerial support, and improved measurement capabilities. . Using JIL we are writing processes for collaborative design and software testing and analysis. This work also provides a platform for research on how to perform rigorous evaluation, comparison, analysis, evolution and improvement of software development processes themselves. The early focus of this work is on comparison and analysis of software design methodologies.</td>
