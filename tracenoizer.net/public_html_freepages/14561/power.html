<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" Several test runs later I started pushing the revs to check vibration levels, etc. I stripped the motor and had it welded and strengthened at a local ally welding company. After seeing the power of the motor, I also redesigned the mounting hardware to include 12 x 6mm bolts. Running the motor in the fuselage was much better with little vibration, except at very low rpm. I had cut the header off the kart muffler and bent up a aluminum tube exhaust (see pic) which I had welded once I had achieved the correct shape.">

 Custom machining of stock Keihin CV carburetor optimizes fill-times and improves mixture velocity. We bore the throat of the CV to achieve the highest C. We modify the idle, midrange, and full power circuits to maximize the performance at all throttle settings. Finally, we use top-of-the-line Creative Cycle Products adjustable idle mixture screws and brass fuel inlets. The greatest improvement per dollar can be found within the carburetor and air cleaner assembly.</td>
