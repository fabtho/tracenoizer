 I did this by cutting off the top of the old fuselage and fitting a ply deck. I shaped new, removable foam turtle-decks to fit flush onto the ply deck. I had seen a similar design to this on the Fibre classics mustangs and it looked a lot easier than trying to do everything through the wing saddle area. I replaced some internal bulkheads to accommodate the compressed air cans for the retracts and beefed up the firewall as well. After speaking to Robert Ercevic in Holland who has a similar setup and gave me some sound advice, I glassed the whole fuselage and wing in light cloth and epoxy resin for added strength.</td>
