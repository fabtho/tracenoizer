 I shaped new, removable foam turtle-decks to fit flush onto the ply deck. I had seen a similar design to this on the Fibre classics mustangs and it looked a lot easier than trying to do everything through the wing saddle area. I replaced some internal bulkheads to accommodate the compressed air cans for the retracts and beefed up the firewall as well. After speaking to Robert Ercevic in Holland who has a similar setup and gave me some sound advice, I glassed the whole fuselage and wing in light cloth and epoxy resin for added strength. The finished fuselage was sprayed with Pajero silver base coat and then 2 layers of clear coat.</td>

 G How many sheets of ice are in the Ralph Engelstad Arena. That is the same as stacking 6 elephants and pushing them onto the field. C There are air blowers in the floor that turn on when the turf is being pulled out. The air actually makes the turf float, so it can easily be moved. D Unlike most football fields, the Alerus has its numbers and lines sewn into the field, not painted.</td>
