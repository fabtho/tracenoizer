<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" Experimental and theoretical research and computer simulation are pursued in IREAP by 57 research scientists. Faculty members affiliated with IREAP are drawn from a variety of disciplines including electrical engineering, materials and nuclear engineering, mathematics, meteorology and physics. ) Approximately 55 graduate students are working on their research dissertation projects with members of the IREAP faculty. The research activity is reinforced and broadened by the presence of some 20 visiting scientists and by collaboration with other teaching faculty who are affiliate members of IREAP. Research programs conducted by the Institute are focused on basic and applied research involving electrically-charged gases (plasmas) and charged particle beams (electron and ion beams), ion beam microfabrication, materials processing, nonlinear dynamics (chaos) and laser-matter interaction.">

 You learned about programming algorithms using recursively defined procedures---first you curse, and then you recurse. You learned how to do mathematical proofs, and how to multiply matrices and compute cross products. Well, you students didn't venture out into this risky unknown, fraught with the danger of showing how ignorant you were precisely when everybody was watching, just out of youth and curiosity. You have to---we make you---otherwise you can't graduate. This brings me to the first serious thing I want to say today.</td>
