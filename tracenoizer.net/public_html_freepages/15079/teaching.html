It contains an outstanding open-access library, runs courses and major conferences, offers research fellowships and other awards and produces many significant research aids and tools. The IHR web site provides information about all of these activities, and offers access to a wide range of electronic resources, from electronic journals to directories of historical research in UK universities, from catalogues of web sites for history to high quality learning and teaching material. It also acts as a bulletin board for the history profession in the UK, with information about conferences and events held throughout the country.

 Faculty members affiliated with IREAP are drawn from a variety of disciplines including electrical engineering, materials and nuclear engineering, mathematics, meteorology and physics. ) Approximately 55 graduate students are working on their research dissertation projects with members of the IREAP faculty. The research activity is reinforced and broadened by the presence of some 20 visiting scientists and by collaboration with other teaching faculty who are affiliate members of IREAP. Research programs conducted by the Institute are focused on basic and applied research involving electrically-charged gases (plasmas) and charged particle beams (electron and ion beams), ion beam microfabrication, materials processing, nonlinear dynamics (chaos) and laser-matter interaction. .</td>
