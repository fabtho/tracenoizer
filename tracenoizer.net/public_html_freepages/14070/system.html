 The Slovenian Group as a member of the International Complex Societal Problem Solving Society (I. ) suggests to intensify the co-operation in the form of the electronic conferences, workshops, projects, conferences and publishing materials under title Climate change implications on our common future. The paper uses the system dynamics approach for study of the atmospheric CO2-dynamics as an example for disturbed flow equilibrium. Exchange of CO2 between living and dead biomass and the atmosphere by photosynthesis, respiration, and decomposition is described. The intention of the EU and its Member States to develop further the methodologies to assess in a quantitative manner the progress in implementation of domestic policies and measures, under the Monitoring Mechanism related to work on indicators, is demonstrated.</td>
