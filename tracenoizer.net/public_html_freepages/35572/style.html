 In the end, acta will have either nullified or encouraged all your frustrations, depending on what kind of person you are. Reminiscent of the rangiest early 90s material from dark canines and their ilk, "Connect" blends the background industrial clank to the lushest of strings and percussive clicks to make, honestly, one of the dreamiest tracks we've put out in ages. And if Aereal isn't significantly more well-known, significantly quickly, we'll eat our post-ironic DJ Touche-style cloth cap. The EP leads off with "Bacurex", a tour de force of understated, melodically dense electronics in the tradition of the best B12 or Black Dog releases. Monotonik is proud to have been associated, if only peripherally, with the rebirth of the early 90s 'Artificial Intelligence' vibe through labels like DeFocus and Neo-Ouija, and here's another prime example.</td>
