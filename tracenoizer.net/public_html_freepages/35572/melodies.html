 For additional infos on the tracks visit 2063music website. This track was done with a cacophony of cantankerous old analogue synths and drum machines and is distinctly influenced by a number of Warp and Rephlex artists. But we like to think the beguiling melodies and intriguing percussion bring a markedly different approach to the whole idm conundrum - if, indeed, it should be called idm. Listen to the fluttering synths and the layers upon layers and the little flourishes and enjoy. The band was recently featured in a Billboard Magazine cover story and won the 2003 Artist of the Year Award given by Vanderbilt University's The Mixdown broadcast.</td>
