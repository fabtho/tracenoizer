zip SUPER GREAT CASIO MUSIC by the CANCER KID, mostly recorded with a single keyboard. definitely one of the best musics ever witnessed, with wonderful catchy melodies. zip WALL OF HYPERTIME, a full length release from THE ABORTIONIST made entirely on a korg es-1 with samples from the movie "day of the beast" NAHC026. super good forward thinking indy rock from MPLS band MORE MATERIAL. savor the changeups, and this new and interesting sound.</td>

 However, his return to the Monotonik fold is much welcomed, and this particular piece of casually expansive retro-activeness is strangely early-90s, in the best 'Artifical Intelligence'-influenced ways. With soaring chords and layer upon layer of melodic electronics, you're guaranteed a good flight in an almost B12-ish way - or your money back. 5 - Catalogue 2004July 26, 2004 LP release proposal (slsk records . It's a very curious release, because the japanese artist gives a portuguese title to his work. Act and Acta (and multiple times as part of xE Phalanx), he's by far the most present artist on our label, and with good reason.</td>
