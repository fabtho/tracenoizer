 As a fellow Jerseyite, I wanted to let you know (I use a T1 line) how great I have found your station to me---it is fabulous. . I grew up in the 70's and listening to your music made me feel like a kid again. You're playing songs that I remember well but haven't heard on the radio since they fell off the charts. Thanks for bringing back some great memories and keep up the great job.</td>
