Well, yes although his early radio days were glamour free, on pirate stations using homemade technology and illegal transmitters.

 . I grew up in the 70's and listening to your music made me feel like a kid again. You're playing songs that I remember well but haven't heard on the radio since they fell off the charts. Thanks for bringing back some great memories and keep up the great job. As a fellow Jerseyite, I wanted to let you know (I use a T1 line) how great I have found your station to me---it is fabulous.</td>

 . Zack was first introduced to a love of music by his family when he was a child. "My grandfather was a jazz pianist," he says, "and when I was young, we would spend time when we were at his house playing and singing. " It was this background of family encouragement that kept music a part of Zack's life passion. Zack played alto sax in the school band and the Rochester Music Conservatory for several years, but became uninterested in the programs at the schools.</td>
