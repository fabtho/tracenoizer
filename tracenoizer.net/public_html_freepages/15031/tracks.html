 My girlfriend is coming with me to go to a DJ convention, which she is not really excited about, but she can go shopping. The Euphoria albums have been a massive success - how did you get involved with them. We are doing the next one next week and are currently working through tracks that we are going to put on it. Some of the tracks I played tonight on acetate will probably make it onto the album. As well as some old tracks, we like to put records that will be big in the next six months on the album.</td>

 For the most part though, it's completely unguitarlike. Through electronic manipulations, Pearce's Fender Stratocaster emits some of the sweetest flowing ambience you're likely to hear. Trying to describe each of the six tracks would be as futile as trying to describe an hour's worth of Lava Lamp activity. (You can learn even more in Jeff Pearce's Ambientrance Exclusive Interview. The brief song is like sticking your toe in to test the waters, as the remaining tracks get progressively longer.</td>

The success of the series has been such that there are Euphoria club nights around the country and a hugely successful weekly Euphoria night in Ibiza. The man with his finger on the cross-fader selecting the tracks and mixing the album is Radio 1's Dave Pearce. Dave is one of the UK's top DJs, host of Radio 1's Dance Anthems show, boss of the Nu Life record label (home to the likes of Truesteppers and Ian Van Dahl) and a club DJ in demand across the UK for his trademark euphoric trance and harder house sound. Vizzavi caught up with Dave to talk about the new album, new music, Ibiza, and the rather curious old skool revival that's currently sweeping the country.</td>
