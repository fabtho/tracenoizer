 Ma Ja Le's Gathering performance will be their first ever on the east coast of the USA and will reflect their interest in soundscapes, texture and rhythm. Anyone interested in hearing how contemporary music can challange and reflect the shape of things to come will find the music at The Gathering Concert Series an ideal resource. Opening for Ma Ja Le will be sonic innovator Jeff Pearce. Based in the Indianapolis area, Pearce is well known to the Spacemusic community for his unique approach to playing guitar. The tones Pearce produces do not betray their origin as they are processed, delayed, distorted and looped to create complex harmonies and timbres not usually associated with an ordinary electric guitar.</td>

 The music of Jeff Pearce shimmers like sunshine through rain. . Pearce produces tones that rarely betray their origin on the electric guitar as they are processed, delayed, distorted and looped to create complex harmonies and timbres. His music is compelling and moody, traversing the Space, Ambient, Experimental and New Age genres. With five full length CDs and tracks on several prestigious anthologies, Pearce "mines the terrain where Ambient, Space and Minimalism converge.</td>
