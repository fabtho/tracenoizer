 I love living in the area of the country that I do- my family and I live on five very secluded acres of forest in Indiana. I can't imagine a more boring place for me than a location where it's always hot or always cold. I was in high school, and it was like discovering another world- the music just moved around so much. I still think those early pieces of music still stand as some of the greatest recordings in this genre- or any other genre, in my opinion. And I was introduced to the wonderful music of Erik Satie by my good friend Tim Story.</td>
