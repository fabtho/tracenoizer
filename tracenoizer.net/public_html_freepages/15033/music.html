 We did a huge amount of hands-on research in Paris. Armed with that research, we went back to Sydney and wrote the first draft. We knew we wanted it to be a musical with modern music in period settings, but how we would tell the story through music was something we had to discover. The way we discovered it was thorough looking at our Orphean character, Christian, played by Ewan McGregor. In the myth, Orpheus is allowed into Underworld due to power and beauty of his musical gift.</td>

 In previous years Pearce had also won the Frank Albert Memorial Prize and the Ignaz Friedman Memorial Prize. A Rotary Scholarship to Sussex University, awarded in 1980, enabled him to continue his studies in composition under Jonathan Harvey at Sussex University. In 1981 Pearce took up a position as a lecturer at the NSW Conservatorium of Music. He received a National Composer Fellowship from the Music Board of the Australia Council in 1985, which allowed him to spend a period of time working and doing research in Italy. He has written music to commission for such ensembles as Synergy and the Seymour Group, as well as solo artists and orchestras.</td>

 Dave Pearce biography BIOGRAPHY - PICS - TRACKS - LINKS Dave Pearce has a long record as a DJ on pirate, commercial and BBC radio, and in the clubs. His first taste of radio came in 1981 as a DJ on the popular pirate station Radio Jackie in South London, while he was still at school. Dave's passion for dance and black music saw him grab an opportunity to work behind the scenes at BBC Radio London where he persuaded bosses to give him a late night show playing all the top club tunes. He then helped create the BBC's first hip hop show, which became a cult late night show and helped launch the careers of previously unknown rap acts. After Dave persuaded the BBC station to hook up with top New York station WBLS for live satellite shows, he was approached by BBC television to help create their first dance show 'Behind The Beat'.</td>
