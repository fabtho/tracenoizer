 University Corporation for Atmospheric Research Massive Weather Study Heads to Oklahoma, KS and TX Led by NCAR, one of the largest weather-related studies in U. history will track the nearly invisible swaths of moisture that fuel heavy rain across the southern Great Plains. Under the primary sponsorship from the National Science Foundation, NCAR and UOP complement and extend the universities' capabilities with collaborative research and community services and tools. ..</td>

Jeremy Roschelle has an extensive background in educational software design, math and science education, collaborative learning, and video analysis methodology. At MIT, he designed and implemented the graphics subsystem for Boxer, a successor to the Logo programing language. D, he analyzed cognitive learning processes by which students develop mental models of velocity and acceleration vectors, and authored a simulation called "The Envisioning Machine" that utilized dynamic graphics and multiple representation.</td>
