 . CEDRO Centrum voor Drugsonderzoek Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences, SCO-Kohnstamm Instituut Wibautstraat 4, 1091 GM Amsterdam P. This book gives an overview of the EU's anti-drugs measures and focuses on its decision-making process. It looks at why drugs have acquired a prominent position on the European political agenda and identifies the political function they serve there. This study shows that instead of solving the drugs problem, the EU's bureaucracy actually helps to keep it alive and well.</td>

 I'd probably count Diablo 2 and EverQuest as the other two. Learn how to tell a story, grab the player's attention from the beginning and don't let go until the credits roll. Figure out what a good pace is for your game and make your game as immersive as the best book or movie you've been caught up with in the past year. If your Siegelet has me saying, "Just one more town, then I'll quit" at 2 am, you've won me as a consumer. Personally, I think DS does a phenomenal job of that immersion, which makes me incredibly proud to have contributed to it.</td>
