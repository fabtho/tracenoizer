 An astronaut is sent to find out what happened to the first team sent to the planet, and he must deal not only with the simian inhabitants, but also with a race of mutants that worship the atomic bomb that made them what they are.

 . A cheat ending spoils this otherwise original and well developed idea. Satanic hippies give a man LSD as part of their sacrificial ritual so his vengeful son injects the blood of a rabid dog into meat pies which he serves to the hippie community. Instead of killing them as planned the infected pies turns them into rampaging maniacs. Due to the controversy the film caused it has been re-edited into what is now an incoherent muddle.</td>
