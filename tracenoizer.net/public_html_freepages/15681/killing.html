 A cheat ending spoils this otherwise original and well developed idea. Satanic hippies give a man LSD as part of their sacrificial ritual so his vengeful son injects the blood of a rabid dog into meat pies which he serves to the hippie community. Instead of killing them as planned the infected pies turns them into rampaging maniacs. Due to the controversy the film caused it has been re-edited into what is now an incoherent muddle. A writer discovers that a scientist working on a cure for cancer has inadvertantly created a race of zombies, by injecting the people of a Caribbean island with snake venom.</td>
