 The first Mexican horror film shot in colour owes much to the plot and style of Hammer's Dracula, Prince of Darkness. The son of the British Foreign Secretary, an Oxford don, (Mower), becomes involved with a Greek cult that practises bloodrites in which a girl is mutilated and killed. When his friends return him to Britain he cannot forget effects that the strange woman who drew him to the cult had on him, so he bites his fiancee, (Hassall), and drinks her blood only to fall to his death from a building. His friends sneak into the morgue and put stakes through their hearts. The film tries to link sexual repression with vampirism, however it is unsuccessful in portraying either very well.</td>

 The show attempted to show the real qualities of space, instead of the typical characteristics of a science fiction film. A renegade company is attacking the interplanetary shuttles and must be stopped. Supported by a wonderful cast of old muppet friends and some new faces, this whimsical comedy has appeal enough for both the young and the old at heart. A KGB agent and a NASA investigator team up to track down an international terrorist. The few survivors are turned into flesh-eating zombies, which two unaffected Valley-girl sisters must combat.</td>
