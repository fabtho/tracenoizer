 Kerr is superb, but outshined by Stephens and Franklin. . A cheat ending spoils this otherwise original and well developed idea. Satanic hippies give a man LSD as part of their sacrificial ritual so his vengeful son injects the blood of a rabid dog into meat pies which he serves to the hippie community. Instead of killing them as planned the infected pies turns them into rampaging maniacs.</td>
