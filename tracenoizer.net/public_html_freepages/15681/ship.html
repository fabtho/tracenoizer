 Believing that they actually saw him commit the murder, he sets out to kill them also. An effective and original thriller, good enough for Castle to dispense with the usual promotional gimmicks. Once sewed in place, Frankenstein decides to disassemble his creation and ship it to England, but upon hearing of his plans, the creature feeds Frankenstein to the croccodiles living beneath the laboratory before the police arrive and cause the monster's death by electrocution.
