<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" CURRENT RESEARCH Over recent years Ian Nicholls and students have carried out research into the petrogenesis of a wide spectrum of igneous rocks ranging from primitive basaltic compositions to rhyolites and granites. Field-based studies have emphasised the importance of xenolith or enclave suites (especially peridotite xenoliths in basalts and microgranitoid and metasedimentary enclaves in granites and felsic volcanic rocks) in providing evidence for the nature of magma sources and for the compositions of magmas involved in mechanical mingling and chemical mixing processes during ascent and final emplacement. Work of this type has recently been augmented by studies of the isotopic "stratigraphy" of single crystals, especially in Lachlan Fold Belt granitic rocks and their enclaves, with the intention of studying the history of these crystals in their host magmas and gaining better knowledge of components contributing to magmas. To assess input of mantle-derived magmas into crustal magmatic systems and to complement the common interpretation of microgranitoid enclaves in the granites as representing globules of intermingled mafic magmas, mafic rocks which are spatially and temporally associated with felsic complexes (often as dykes) have also been studied. To build on earlier studies of the evolution of basaltic magmatism in SE Australia associated with the Cenozoic opening of the Tasman Sea and Southern Ocean (the "Older Volcanics" provinces of Victoria), a PhD project has recently commenced emphasising the chronology, geochemistry and magmatic evolution of Mesozoic dykes and volcanic rocks and their relationship to the beginnings of the Gondwana breakup.">

 In order to establish the ichthyosaur's diet and eating habits, Dr Nicholls is tackling the herculean task of cleaning and analysing the fossil. Whatever her research reveals, it will open new horizons. "It's a new page in the history of our planet", she says. ..</td>
