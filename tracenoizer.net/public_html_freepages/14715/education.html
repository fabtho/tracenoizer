 The society has annual meetings devoted to biophysical topics, usually held in association with the Canadian Federation of Biological Societies (CFBS), the next such event being scheduled for June 18-21, 1997 in Quebec City. I am also immediate Past President of Science for Peace, the Canadian organization concerned with the responsibilities of science and scientists to ensure that scientific ideas and technology are used in humane and life-enhancing ways. Science for Peace engages in research, education and action for peace in a scientific context. The organization was founded by concerned Canadian academics in 1981 at the height of the Cold War. Despite the end or transformation of that War the development, the testing, and in some cases the actual use of a wide range of weapons whose existence is a result of science and technology has continued.</td>
