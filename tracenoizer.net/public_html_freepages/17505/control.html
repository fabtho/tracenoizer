 To be perfectly candid, I did not check each and every TVA response. " In addition, the NRC has introduced new regulations, upgraded many other regulations, and specified numerous requirements for its licensees. As you recall, TVA told the NRC that it shut down Browns Ferry Unit 1 in March 1985 due to design basis control problems. I trust that you'll believe me when I say that it is highly unlikely that the design basis control problems which were serious enough to shut down the plant, have been magically healed during thirteen years of "administrative hold. " In other words, TVA will perform the extensive reviews, inspections, and tests needed to restart Units 2 and 3 at some future date.</td>
