 . The old order's dissolution will have begun--and it is not reversible. While we have seen some deregulation of the telecommunications industry, the biggest steps lie ahead. In the United States, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 still awaits, in 2000, the full impact of competition among local carriers that lawmakers envisioned.
