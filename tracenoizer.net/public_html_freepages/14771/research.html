 Also included is the Mozart sonata used in research to demonstrate the existence of the Mozart effect, and a demonstration version of our STAR software. . Institute Music - Intelligence - Neural - Development Research into the Mozart effect, music and math education. Here you will find abstracts and research pertaining to the Mozart effect, the benefits of music education and information about our quest to use this knowledge for the benefit of students through our MST Math program and Spatial-Temporal Animation Reasoning (STAR) software. Our Latest Research Our latest paper, available in our Research section, shows that math integration in conjunction with our music training and spatial-temporal reasoning software has a profound benefit to students' scores on both an Advanced Math Concepts Test and the national Stanford 9 math test.</td>
