 Although the lawsuit was settled for less, the Lovett case and another in New Brunswick, N. , yielded testimony suggesting that AHP received numerous reports of heart-valve and other problems without alerting the FDA. Frederick Wilson, one of AHP's medical monitors for Pondimin, testified that by 1994 the company had received reports of 41 Pondimin users with potentially fatal primary pulmonary hypertension - and that AHP did not update the drug's package insert with a warning about that problem for two years. AHP officials countered that the company was awaiting data from a large study on the lung disorder. In 1995, Wilson testified, the company received reports of heart-valve problems from Belgium.</td>
