 I am currently a student at UEA in England, studying Film and English. Directing and making amateur films is a great passion of mine and I want to be able to make a living at it. This web site is designed to offer a form of online portfolio to show off my work. It is also intended to act as a resource for other film makers. For special effects, production and shooting tips look no further.</td>
