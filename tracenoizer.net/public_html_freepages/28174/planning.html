 For special effects, production and shooting tips look no further. I consider the films to be experiments in film making, editing and special fx. I am currently planning the next project; simply put, a good film. ..</td>

 You will issue and require personnel to wear and use protective clothing and equipment as prescribed in 241 FW 3, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), and 241 FW 7, Firefighting. Visibility is a major consideration in smoke management. Your planning for prescribed fire must include the potential for hazardous situations, including impaired visibility created by smoke both on and off our lands. You must meet the provisions of the Clean Air Act and the State Implementation Plan (SIP). All planning for prescribed fire must include consultation with appropriate State and local agencies.</td>

 Kirtland, USAF OFTEN THE lessons we learn best from combat come not from our victories but from our failures. Such a case is the Rail Interdiction Program, better known as Operation Strangle, conducted in Korea from the summer of 1951 to early 1952. Enthusiasm for air power and the desire to show that air power was enough to win a war were not enough to make up for deficiencies in planning, command structure, or resources that plagued this operation. The lessons those airmen learned so painfully, and at such a cost, forty years ago are still relevant today. Effective air operations come from understanding one's doctrine, knowing one's limitations, and most of all, from thoroughly planning the campaign from beginning to end.</td>
