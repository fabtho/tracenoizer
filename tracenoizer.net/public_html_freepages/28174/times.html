 Examination of seedbed receptivity and careful ageing of white spruce in stands of varying ages indicated that the window of opportunity for recruitment following fire is about 3 years. In the years thereafter, white spruce occurrence is negatively impacted by falling logs, accumulation of litter, and development of grass cover. Occurrence of a mast seed year within two years of a burn had a dramatic effect on density of white spruce (2 to 4 times higher than sites with low seed production after fire). This mast seed year effect on density of white spruce could still be detected in stands 40 years post-fire. We hypothesise that conditions immediately following fire determine the occurrence, and density, of white spruce establishment on mixedwood sites and set stands on one of a few successional pathways, only one of which is likely to succeed to spruce-dominated.</td>

 Goshen and I agreed that you were the guy for the job. Plus you have to split with La Tech each season to stay in the good graces of the TxTop Church. If that involves a trip to Vegas and Hawaii a couple of times a year so be it. Just get it done and when you're put on the stand refer to yourself as Ollie North. We don't need a stinking study on it - just get it done, get it done quickly and under budget.</td>
