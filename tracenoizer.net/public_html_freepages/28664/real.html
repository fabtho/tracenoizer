 Chest radiographs remain widely used, but the applications of computer technology in Radiology over the last two decades have led to new imaging techniques capable of demonstrating both fine detail of normal structures and subtle disease processes previously undetectable without invasive procedures such as surgery. The use of imaging techniques for the diagnosis of disease continues to increase rapidly, and familiarization with these investigations is valuable in virtually all areas of medical practice. Thoracic Radiology introduces first and second year medical students to various imaging modalities which may be used to identify and assess the anatomical structures within the thorax and to introduce the concept of living Anatomy by the use of real-time dynamic images. The purpose of this program is to demonstrate the various imaging modalities which may be used to identify and assess the anatomical structures within the thorax and to introduce the concept of living anatomy by the use of real-time dynamic images. Comparative digitized radiographic images and techniques, computer graphics, anatomical drawings, and textual information.</td>

 . Then the gardener wonders about the soil and if it "needs something. " Don't guess, soil test Soil testing is the only real way to know the fertility level of the soil; you can't determine nutrient levels or the pH by simply looking at it. If a new lawn is being established, start with a soil test. It's easiest to add and incorporate corrective levels of fertilizer and pH adjusters (lime or sulfur) before the seed is sown or sod is laid.</td>

 What they were trying to do was get all those end-users and distributors doing the same sorts of things. Jim was involved in all that and said that we really had to have two codes. And of course that wasn't flying real well with some of us. This code says that if the customer doesn't follow it we'll stop selling (. I'm going to that board meeting in a few weeks and I'm going to tell them the way the world is.</td>
