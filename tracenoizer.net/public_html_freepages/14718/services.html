 Robin Bitman -USA (visited June '98) As we have arrived home safely and successfully we want to thank you for the special service you provide. Surely we will contact you when we or our friends will come to Italy. Rome has many attractions made more attractive by your kind services. We greatly enjoyed our stay in the apartment and look forward to a return to Rome and Roman Homes. I will certainly recommend your company to any friends who may be interested.</td>
