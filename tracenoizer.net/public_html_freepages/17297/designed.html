<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" . Spoil Ground Studies ETS have carried out a number of spoil ground studies, including one for the Port of Felixstowe to characterise the Rough Tower Dump Site. This study was designed in order to quantify the loss of dredged material from the site, determine the rate, direction and extent of dispersal from the dump ground and estimate the possible lifespan of the site. In addition, the study was aimed at determining any sites where increased siltation may cause a concern to fisheries. The rate and volume of sediment return to the main navigational channel and the Port of Felixstowe were also determined.">

 . PREVIOUS ENTRY Sweet Success SCIENCE ACTIVITY BOOKS NEXT ENTRY Thrill Ride. Targeting Students' Science Misconceptions, a teacher's guide containing directions for approximately 100 activities, is designed to help students identify and change their common, naive preconceptions and misconceptions about science topics. In doing these activities, students first state their ideas about a wide range of physical science concepts, and then they rethink or reconsider them after experimentation in the classroom. They try out the various options and come up with an answer based on their observations.</td>

 . Young Engineers and Scientists Program 1997 Version Web Page Welcome to the YES program Web page. The YES program was designed to open students' minds to the world of engineering and science in order to delineate and clarify different career fields and to offer them the opportunity to explore their interests. This is an enriching summer program for high school juniors and seniors held at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas. Participating students are interested in taking ISM (Independent Study Mentorship).</td>
