<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" George Ryan announced a death-penalty moratorium this week, Gov. Bush's home team is publishing nearly every grisly detail of its execution records online. Like a macabre, taxpayer-funded "FBI's Most Wanted" for the Internet crowd, the site catalogs the last meals and final statements of 206 men and women executed in Texas since 1982, 119 since Bush took office in 1995. Larry Todd, spokesman of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, says the department's site helps quench the public's insatiable interest in prisoners on death row. Texas leads the nation in executions -- and has given lethal injections to six men already in 2000.">
