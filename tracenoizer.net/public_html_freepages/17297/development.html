 . Semiconductor Technology - Texas Instruments DMOS 5 Semiconductor Wafer Fabrication Plant, Dallas, Texas. DMOS 5 SEMICONDUCTOR WAFER FABRICATION PLANT , USA Texas Instruments has sponsored the development of a new semiconductor wafer production facility in Dallas, USA. The company is a well-known producer of microprocessor products for the consumer market, and its incentive for investment in the new plant is based on the company's view that there is a growing worldwide demand for TI semiconductor products. The semiconductor industry in general saw a huge rise in demand during 1993.</td>

 These are the fields in which women and minorities are most underrepresented (Banditt, 1992; Pool, 1990). To address the problem of retention, YES emphasizes networking among peer students and mentorship between students and professionals already established in the field. Mentorship is recognized as a necessary component in professional development (Gibbons, 1992; White, 1970) and acknowledged as a critical component of development progr;ams for gifted and talented students (Beck, 1989). The importance of a peer support group is also widely noted (Council of Ontario Universities, 1988; American Association of University Women, 1992). The YES program and 20 participants during its first year (1993-1994) and presently 22 students are enrolled for the current academic year (1994-1995).</td>
