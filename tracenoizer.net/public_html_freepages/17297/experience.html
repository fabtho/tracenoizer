Aureal has provided us with an engineer to implement the new A3D 3. Expect the sound in Experience to be truly state-of-the art, and compatible with all audio cards including both A3D and EAX users. As for the future, I can't go in to a lot of detail right now. We are entering a phase of the project where game play issues are starting to get locked down, but there are still a few things which have not been set in stone.">

 Alireza will receive the award on November 6 at the AVS 49th International Symposium in Denver. Alireza is a graduate research assistant in the MEMS Sensors and Actuators Lab. Our design for the SHOP2 planning algorithm was based on the theories of planning that we developed as a result of our experience with application domains such as automated process planning, the game of bridge, and noncombatant evacuation planning. Nau; Tsz-Chiu Au (PhD student in CS); Okhtay Ilghami (PhD student in CS); Ugur Kuter (PhD student in CS); Bill Murdock (postdoctoral researcher at the Naval Research Laboratory); Dan Wu (PhD student in CS); and Fusun Yaman (PhD student in CS). The fellowship is sponsored by the National Consortium for Graduate Degrees for Minorities in Engineering and Science, Inc.</td>
