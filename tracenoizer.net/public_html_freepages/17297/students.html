 . Young Engineers and Scientists Program 1997 Version Web Page Welcome to the YES program Web page. The YES program was designed to open students' minds to the world of engineering and science in order to delineate and clarify different career fields and to offer them the opportunity to explore their interests. This is an enriching summer program for high school juniors and seniors held at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas. Participating students are interested in taking ISM (Independent Study Mentorship).</td>

 . PREVIOUS ENTRY Sweet Success SCIENCE ACTIVITY BOOKS NEXT ENTRY Thrill Ride. Targeting Students' Science Misconceptions, a teacher's guide containing directions for approximately 100 activities, is designed to help students identify and change their common, naive preconceptions and misconceptions about science topics. In doing these activities, students first state their ideas about a wide range of physical science concepts, and then they rethink or reconsider them after experimentation in the classroom. They try out the various options and come up with an answer based on their observations.</td>
