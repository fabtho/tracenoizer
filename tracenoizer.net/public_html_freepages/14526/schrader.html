 A popular response in the literature is for nonprofit organizations to manage themselves better and more efficiently in the new competitive and performance-driven world they now face. Improving management is seen both as a way of raising operational effectiveness and as a method of reducing costs. Dozens of books aim to help nonprofit practitioners improve their organizations and manage more effectively and efficiently (Antos and Brimson 1994; Dropkin and LaTouche 1998; Drucker 1992; Eadie and Schrader 1997; Firstenberg 1996; Pynes and Schrader 1997; Wolf 1990). Many of these titles attempt to bring business concepts such as reengineering, quality management, and benchmarking to bear on the nonprofit sector, usually with the intent of raising the level of organizational and program performance. A common theme that emerges from these texts is that the absence of a traditional bottom line in the nonprofit sector-far from freeing nonprofits to blindly pursue their missions-means that these organizations must manage themselves especially well and develop a special kind of operational discipline.</td>
