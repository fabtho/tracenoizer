 The personal-computer segment of IBM's business continued to be weak, a press release said. Industrywide PC demand has been slow for several quarters. With IBM, investors are paying for smart management and stability, not fast-paced growth, said Morningstar stock analyst Joseph Beaulieu in a recent analysis. That figure includes a charge covering the cost of excess inventory, layoff expenses, and the write-down of certain investments. Unfortunately, the problems at EMC don't look like a temporary blip.</td>

 Second place California produces about 22 billion pounds, and New York is a distant third with 10 billion pounds of milk. The root of the problem lies in volatile milk prices and low dairy price supports, according to Robert Cropp, dairy marketing and policy specialist at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. In addition, many small farmers have not kept up with technology and updated herd management techniques, Cropp says. But the declining number of cows is nothing compared to the decline in the number of dairy farmers. About 1,000 dairy farms disappear each year, and Cropp predicts that up to a third of Wisconsin's dairy farmers will be out of business by the end of the decade.</td>
