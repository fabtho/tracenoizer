 These coolers have proven to be the most suitable for Telehouse projects. .5MW Adiabatic Dry Coolershave recently been installed in Hemel Hempstead and Bristol for telecommunications company 186K Limited. They provide cooling water to the absorption chillers serving the Combined Cooling and Power system designed and installed by Brotherhood Aircogen in partnership with Lattice Energy Services.
