 Sexual references are mild, without the prostitution and homosexuality seen in small parts of "FF7". Language and profanity is also down too, compared to "FF7". The game's occult references are typical for a FF game, involving the average combat magic and new "guardian forces"; something like angels that grant temporal powers. During a swordfight, small wounds are exchanged; at one point Squall is tortured on an electrical rack; the villainess impales Squall with an icicle early in the game (this is not fully shown); and a girl suffocates in space (during a dream sequence). Rather than embrace New Age spirituality (as "FF7" did), "FF8" focuses on service, selflessness, and love (all distinctly godly themes).</td>

 His Enc-None and Enc-Half saved me a lot of time from fighting those damn annoying little enemies on the World Map. And his 'Darkside' ability kicked in the final battles. Diablos' Abilities Junction Abilities Name AP Needed HP-J Junctions magic to Vitality. 120 Abilityx3 Allows character to junction 3 abilities. Completed Draw Allows character to draw magic from an enemy.</td>

 Polish him off with a few well-timed guardian force summons. Darkside lets you sacrifice a tenth of a character's max hit points to deal a triply powerful blow; a worthy sacrifice to finish off a weakened opponent. Mug is vital for finding rare items necessary for weapons upgrades and Quistis' blue magic. Enc-half and enc-none eliminate the headaches of random encounters. .</td>
