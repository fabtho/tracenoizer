 This is also great on your Adel, Griever and Ultimecia battles. . Once you get into the battle with him, use Shiva as often as possible. Have one member attack with Quezacolt but concentrate more on healing Squall or Quistis. Ifrit is a rather easy catch, do not be afraid to take some time to draw magic from him.</td>

 The recommends you should save before you use the lamp. He did a lot of damage to the relatively large and powerful enemies towards the end of the game (Sadly, Ruby Dragon wasn't one of them). He also helped when I had to battle 20 Tonberries at the Centra Ruins. But sadly, sometimes his attack will miss and it was such a waste of time summoning him. If you don't know why 'Mug' is important then you have problems.</td>

 He is weak against fire and holy, Cure spells and potions do damage too. If you think he is a waste of time to fight, end him with a Phoenix Down. After the terrible and gruesome battle, yawn, form a new party and talk to Watts to leave the train. Timber Station Head north from the depot to reach the Pet Shop. Head south past the hotel to the guards and defeat them.</td>
