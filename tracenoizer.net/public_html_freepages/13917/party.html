 . Talk to him again to receive the magical lamp - using this item will bring you into battle with the Diablos guardian force. Go to the library with Zell in your party and talk to the pony-tailed girl in front of the bookcase - she has a crush on Zell. Head to the train depot in Balamb town, purchase a ticket, and board. Once the train starts moving, enter the cabin and talk to Zell.</td>

 . Talk to Cid again to receive the Magical Lamp, no theres no genie, using this item will give a ring to Diablos in the 3rd dimension and wake him up. If you want, go to the library with Zell in your party and talk to the pony-tailed girl in front on the bookcase, she has a crush on Zell, hehehe. Anyways, head to the train depot in Balamb town, you can find an issue of Timber Maniacs near the train signal and another in the Hotel in the guest room. Once the train starts moving, enter the cabin and talk to Zell.</td>

 Have one member attack with Quezacolt but concentrate more on healing Squall or Quistis. Ifrit is a rather easy catch, do not be afraid to take some time to draw magic from him. After Ifrit joins your party, run around to get into random battles to boost his level and yours. You will meet a stone minotaur, walk up and talk to it. Careful, because he casts Regen on himself often and can pound you with his mallet to lower your HP dramatically.</td>
