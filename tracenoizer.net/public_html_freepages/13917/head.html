 Talk to Cid again to receive the Magical Lamp, no theres no genie, using this item will give a ring to Diablos in the 3rd dimension and wake him up. If you want, go to the library with Zell in your party and talk to the pony-tailed girl in front on the bookcase, she has a crush on Zell, hehehe. Anyways, head to the train depot in Balamb town, you can find an issue of Timber Maniacs near the train signal and another in the Hotel in the guest room. Once the train starts moving, enter the cabin and talk to Zell. Laguna is Squall, Ward as Zell, and Selphie as Kiros.</td>
