 If the pile should become too wet, turn it to dry it out, or add dry carbon materials to the pile. . Worm Composting Learning More AR Natural Home Air and Moisture are Important The composting process is an aerobic process; decomposition needs air or oxygen to occur. When the compost pile is lacking in oxygen, decomposition slows and odors occur. Add air to the pile by mixing, turning, stirring, fluffing or using air stacks (pipes with holes) in the pile.</td>
