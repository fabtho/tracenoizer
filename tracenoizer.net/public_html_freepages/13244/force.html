 The Flight has a Primary Reserve establishment of three full-time and eight part-time personnel. The AR Flt is comprised of aircrew, support, and clerical staff who augment most sections and all squadrons at 8 Wing. Since the majority of 8 AR Flt personnel have Regular Force experience, they are able to merge into their units' operations with no additional training. Units can generally expect the part-time Reservist to work an average of eight days per month. The purpose of this work is to train the Reservist for potential national emergencies.</td>

The field does not force you to enter both CITY and STATE (or country), but you should make it as clear as possible. The other three agencies will send tickets b y express mail at no additional cost. An edit check will prevent the use of invalid numbers.</td>
