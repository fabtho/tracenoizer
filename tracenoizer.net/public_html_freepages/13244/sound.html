 Supported modes are RTTY (Baudot code), ASCII (7 or 8 bits), PSK31 (BPSK and QPSK) and AMTOR-FEC (SITOR-B, NAVTEX). SELFEC SITOR,HF- and UHF-PACKET (AX25) decoding is possible also. No additional hardware is required - your need only transceiver and computer with sound card. Optionally you can use simple circuit for PTT-control.

 From our first transmission in February 1998, r a d i o q u a l i a has been an active participant in the international net. radio community, as represented by forums such as Xchange. Informed by the discrete discourses surrounding science, art and philosophy, r a d i o q u a l i a is attempting to simulate the introspectible and seemingly monadic properties of sense-datum, through sound. We work, with, rather than against the limitations of the media. To this end r a d i o q u a l i a regularly feature performances and netcasts which bring different collaborators together in online performative spaces.</td>

 What we wanted to do was to get the production equipment used and visible in their exhibition spaces, and create a programme was cheap and practical, that opened up a hands-on, DIY approach to networks and media but which never quite forgot the politics of the technologies that we were using and abusing. Media streaming was a big part of our programme, and at each different venue we experimented in different ways. Hull Time Based Arts is an artist-run organisation which for 15 years has been supporting sound, performance, film and video work, that usually takes a socially aware and mould-breaking attitude to contexts and content. Down At PVA we couldn't help noticing that the the lab's next-door neighbours were taking the oldest and maybe best approach to distribution. .</td>
