 The administrator console consists of remote software for discovering available PCs and for viewing their system status, hardware and software inventories, log files and other items. . By utilizing standards and industry initiatives such as DMI, SNMP and Intel's Wired for Management (WfM) initiative, it inventories critical hardware and software components and monitors PC health, providing local and remote alert notification. It relieves many of the problems of systems management by making it easy for system administrators to access the information they need to keep networked PCs running efficiently. Intel LANDesk Client Manager 6 also provides troubleshooting and problem resolution tools, and an event log to track system activity.</td>
