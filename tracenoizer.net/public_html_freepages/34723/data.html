 ) Unfortunately I think this would only be modest win. About 1 in 3 results has one, and I only expect that to go up. Interesting data by looking at references of TableLine in JProbe. For questions about specific projects, see that project's pages for more information. .</td>

 . Basically like Fourier, but the basis functions are squarewaves with different sequencies. I did this for a transform data compression study a while back. Here's some code to do a walsh hadamard transform on long ints in-place (you need to divide by n to get transform) the order is bit-reversed at output, IIRC. The inverse transform is the same as the forward transform (expects bit-reversed input).</td>
