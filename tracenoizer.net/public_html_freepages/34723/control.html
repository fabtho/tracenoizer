 It is also possible to wipe a form from bottom to top, and from both sides to the middle, using similar routines Create a form bigger than the screen. The AddressOf operator requires you to place the callback routine in a module. This module is shared between all instances of your control and the variables and subroutines that the module provide are not unique to each instance. The easiest way to visualize the problem is to imagine a shared phoneline (or a partyline as we hicks call it) where multiple parties are trying to dial a number, talk, and hangup, all at the same time. What's needed is an operator, a routine that controls the dialing (hooking), the talking (the callback routine), and who routes information to the instance of the control that requested it.</td>
