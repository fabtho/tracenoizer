<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" Prior to its launch, online searches delivered too much information (a search for Pablo Picasso could list 20,000 results), not enough context and no way to determine relevancy. This comprehensive site for the visual and performing arts, design, literature, music and film interconnects all art-related subjects by using key words to make connections between artists and movements. In addition, it expands access to online arts and culture resources by using clearly-designed pages, clever navigation devices, publishing technology and a patent-pending user-interface. It uses a computational platform to put forward a perpetual curation in which all of the arts touch at surprising angles to each other, revealing varied contexts at different junctures. While navigating the site, a certain type of fluidity emerges; it is an open work of infinite and extensible variation, a machine that writes and reads, precisely and poetically.">
