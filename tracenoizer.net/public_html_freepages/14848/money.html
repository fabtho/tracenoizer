 In his other life, Steve works on the floor of the NYSE where he is managing director of floor operations for LL Partners. Annually he takes 15 or so of his clients (hedge fund managers mostly) to the Final Four (via charted jet), where he puts together a basketball tourney in which he and clients play and dine with lots of ex-pro's and current coaches. Hey if your a BB junkie and manage money (we wish we did), now would be the time to connect with Steve at LL Partners (212-514-5295). ..</td>
