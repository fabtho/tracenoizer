There are over a dozen additional projects outside these programs. TOGA efforts focus on development of improved tropical SST fields based on satellite infrared observations. The JGOFS project is to provide near-real time cruise support of the Arabian Sea process study and post experiment analysis of upper mixed layer heat content and biological response.

 Its main objective is to secure easy access for the Norwegian research community to data and to provide various services. The Norwegian web pages RESEARCH GRANTS - CALL FOR PROPOSALS NSDaccess Norwegian Social Science Data Services (NSD) has been selected for funding as a Large Scale Facility (LSF) under the Training and Mobility of Researchers (TMR) Programme of the European Union. Information on Research and Higher Education NSD is responsible for the documentation of research projects and related publications in the social sciences, the humanities, medicine, environment and development research. Furthermore the idea is to contribute to the development of analytical and methodological skills among users. .</td>

 . The Academy provides a professional home and technical assistance resource for researchers and policy professionals. Committed to the vision of improving health and health care by generating new knowledge and moving knowledge into action, the Academy seeks to stimulate the development, understanding, and use of the best available health services research and health policy information by public and private decision makers. An integral part of that endeavor, this new Academy Web site is a work in progress. .</td>
