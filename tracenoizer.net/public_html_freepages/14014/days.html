 And, when he announced that Sandy Hollway was staying, the room erupted into prolonged applause. Thirty senior managers have also signed a statement of support for Mr Hollway but Michael Knight doesn't believe that's a vote of no confidence in him. Three days ago Mr Knight initiated a parliamentary inquiry into SOCOG's disastrous ticketing operation. Sources say the push against Sandy Hollway was a clear attempt by Mr Knight to sheet home any blame the inquiry may lay at Mr Hollway's feet. In other words, Michael Knight was hoping to deflect any criticism over the ticketing ballot away from himself.</td>

 . Michael Barrett came from a small farm in Drumnagreshial, Fermanagh, and was 27 when he was publicly hanged in front of Newgate Jail in London in May 1868. Three days after the hanging, public executions were banned and all subsequent executions took place within the prison walls. Mr Barrett was a member of the Fenians and had been found guilty of blowing up the wall of Clerkenwell House of Detention in London in 1867. The bombing was an attempt to free Richard O'Sullivan Burke, an Irish Republican Brotherhood member, but it went wrong and killed at least six people and injured many more.</td>
