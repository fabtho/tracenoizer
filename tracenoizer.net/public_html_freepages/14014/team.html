 I just don't seem to do much hiking, fishing, or karate any more. One of the best jobs I've ever worked at is here at Cerro Coso where I work with the Special Services department. I work with a lot of caring, giving, individuals that are fun to work with and make a great team. Family My mom and pops are in Inyokern, Don and Sue Barrett. I have two brothers and a sister still floating around town, Brian, Jeff, and Lynette (the dynamic trio).</td>
