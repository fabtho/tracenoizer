 Barrett had a pretty good rookie year in 1999 shuttling between third base and catcher, then dropped off the face of the earth in 2000 by playing brutal defense, getting demoted twice, and hitting . Last year he was exclusively a catcher in a relaxed atmosphere under the tutelage of (cough) Jeff Torborg, and he responded by getting his head together and rebounding to his 1999 levels. He's got a better grip on his job than similarly-bad Peter Bergeron does, but he's also entering what could be his third-straight awful season, and it's time for him to show something . Granted, Barrett's only 25 this year, and catchers take a long time to develop, and the team messed around with him for a while. People say that he's due to break out anytime, especially now that's he's under Frank Robinson, who's basically said he's going to shut up and let Barrett play almost all the time.</td>

Originally taken by the Expos as a shortstop in the first round of the June 1995 draft, Barrett was switched to catcher at the tail end of his tenure with the club's Rookie League team that fall. En route to winning the franchise's minor-league Player of the Year Award in 1998, Barrett made the second radical re-alignment of his young career when Montreal planted him at third base for the second half of the season at Double-A Harrisburg. com Jump directly to Library content from any website. After getting his first taste of major-league action in a brief September callup that year (he was behind the plate when Cardinals' slugger Mark McGwire clubbed his record-setting 69th and 70th home runs on the final day of the season), Barrett won a spot on the Expos' roster the next spring.</td>
