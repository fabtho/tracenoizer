 Classification by income does not necessarily reflect development status. Moderately indebted means either of the two key ratios exceeds 60 percent of, but does not reach, the critical levels. For economies that do not report detailed debt statistics to the World Bank Debtor Reporting System (DRS), present-value calculation is not possible. Instead, the following methodology is used to classify the non-DRS economies. Moderately indebted means three of the four key ratios exceed 60 percent of, but do not reach, the critical levels.</td>

 Since the mid 1980s, however, the two-way approach has attracted renewed interest, and many new programs have been established. This interest was likely the result of a convergence of factors, including increased attention to foreign language learning for English speakers, research on effective programs for educating language minority students, and the availability of federal and state funding for programs using this approach. A goal of the study, and of this report, is to assist current and prospective programs with their planning by giving them a picture of what other programs are doing. Following a short review of the goals and rationale for two-way programs, the results of the study will be discussed. Two-way programs share many features but vary in significant ways as well, and these areas of variability in implementation will be a focus of this report.</td>
