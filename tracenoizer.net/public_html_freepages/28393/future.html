 Our goal is to develop an information resource center on the web created and maintained by the citizens of Shepherdstown and dedicated to the preservation of our singular quality of life. Use the links below to add your comments to a discussion group, or post a topic or issue relating to Our Shepherdstown. Check out the 2000 edition of the Shepherdstown Comprehensive Plan which signals the first effort to revise the original plan of 1978 and to update the plan to more accurately reflect development conditions for future community change while safeguarding the aesthetic, natural and historic qualities that typify Shepherdstown. com This site is sponsored by the Greater Shepherdstown Association. .</td>

 This simply replaces the current info with what was last saved to disk. The only time this button is needed is when the data in one of the Textinput gadgets on the user info tabs is manually changed. It also will apply to the specific prefs settings for the UIN the user window belongs to in a future version of STRICQ. The only time a user's info is pulled from the server is when the UIN Search window is used. For some people like myself, as author of STRICQ, I will update my userinfo quite often.</td>

 Check it out and see what conclusions they came to. And some OSes are inherently a little faster due to their organization. This report is a little dated, and in the near future, you will see some even better performance from the PC UNIX world, I believe. All apps end up calling the API, one way or another. Maybe some version of unix does more rigorous checking on the entry parameters than NT, so a dodgy app is less likely to crash under it.</td>
