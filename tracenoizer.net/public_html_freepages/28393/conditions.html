 Our goal is to develop an information resource center on the web created and maintained by the citizens of Shepherdstown and dedicated to the preservation of our singular quality of life. Use the links below to add your comments to a discussion group, or post a topic or issue relating to Our Shepherdstown. Check out the 2000 edition of the Shepherdstown Comprehensive Plan which signals the first effort to revise the original plan of 1978 and to update the plan to more accurately reflect development conditions for future community change while safeguarding the aesthetic, natural and historic qualities that typify Shepherdstown. com This site is sponsored by the Greater Shepherdstown Association. .</td>

 Some programs are neighborhood based and only enroll students from the local neighborhood. Others are magnet schools and have open enrollment for students from throughout the district. Some programs operate under a combination of these conditions; for example, they might give preference to neighborhood students, but fill openings in the program with applicants from other areas of the district. In nearly all cases, participation is voluntary, and parents choose to enroll their children in the program. Most programs begin at the kindergarten or first grade level (a few have preschool components) and extend through the elementary span of the school (usually fifth or sixth grade).</td>

 I am primarily a UNIX developer; so I have had to rely on NT experts to get me past some wicked problems. If you try to use their POSIX personality (I tried), you get into a lot of trouble (which I've had). (But then, under those same conditions, any modern demand paged OS with eough memory will be fast. This argues that simulation should run equally well on both UNIX and NT, given enough memory. ) But when you try to switch between tasks, or worse still, create new ones, there is a marked sluggishness.</td>
