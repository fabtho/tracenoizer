 I realise you use CVS for development but would you consider numbering stable releases with even minor version numbers (1. to avoid people like me not getting the latest stable version through a bad assumption. I can't see this hurting version numbering but I can see it gaining more users of the latest version. net UNSOLICITED COMMERCIAL E-MAIL IS NOT WELCOME AT THIS ADDRESS _____________________________________________________________ Want a new web-based email account . .</td>

 if a tool is too expensive, then i have the choice to possibly go with some other manufacturer. obviously, sales volumes will make prices drop, since the design and maitenance cost of a tool are fixed per version but the manufacturing costs are really quite low. if the tools are well designed and has good doc the support costs should be low and the users happy. lots of m-board competition, and with the amd k6 and others, there's getting to be some real competition for cpu slots. performance and it's accellerating, with prices dropping.</td>
