 . Based on the linear compaction algorithm, the modularity property of a single input signature register (SISR), and the sparsity of the error-domain input, some new accelerating schemes---partial input look-up tables and reverse zero-checking policy---are developed to boost the signature computation speed. Mathematical analysis and simulation results show that this algorithm has an order of magnitude speedup without extra memory requirement compared with the linear compaction algorithm. Though originally derived for SISR, this algorithm is applicable to MISR by a simple conversion procedure or a bit-adjusting scheme with little effort. Consequently, a very fast MISR signature simulation can be achieved.</td>

 It wasn't until the eleventh century that a method for solving quadratic and cubic equations was recorded, although they seemed to have existed since the first millennium. At this time Jia Xian 'generalised the square and cube root procedures to higher roots by using the array of numbers known today as the Pascal triangle and also extended and improved the method into one useable for solving polynomial equations of any degree' (Katz, 1993, p191). order roots for n 3 by using the binomial expansion. Katz reports (1993, p191) 'Yang Hui stated that he Jia Xina not only wrote out the Pascal triangle of binomial coefficients through to the sixth row but also developed the usual method of generating the triangle - add the numbers in the two places above in order to find the number in the place below. This year's annual Summer Solo Show, open Monday through Saturday ending August 22, features two artists who chose Maui as their home and whose art ranks with the best in the world.</td>

 Next, the classical inventory problem with stochastic demand was formulated with the variation that customer service level was based on the 'fill rate' , an old notion of RG Brown, instead of the more usual proportion of demand satisfied using the normal distribution. The main advantage of the bootstrap, besides simplicity, is that it is a non-parametric approach to the setting of service levels. Given a bootstrap sample of demand, the selection of a variable re-order level and an objective function based on the 'fill rate', the goal seeking feature of Excel can be used to select the required re-order level. In the Excel context, the modelling is not mathematically sophisaticated. There are no underlying distributional assumptions and can be applied to a wide variety of products.</td>
