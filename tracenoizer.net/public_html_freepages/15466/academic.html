 . Our goals are both to do original research which can be published in the open literature, and to see the results of our work used in technologies that are of benefit to users. We are interested in collaborating with outside academic or industrial partners in pursuit of either or both of these goals. What we do Our work is mainly in the areas of speech recognition and synthesis. The results of this research are reported in our publications and implemented in useful software, like the Festival speech synthesis system.</td>

 In the latest Research Assessment Exercise (RAE), SPRU has again received one of the top ratings with a 5A grade. The RAE results, which were announced on 14 December 2001, confirm SPRU's position as one of the world's leading research centres in the field of science and technology policy. ) This report aims to provide up-to-date information on academic and policy analysis of the returns to academic research. It shows the capabilities that firms need to develop, the key business challenges they face, and outlines the experiences of five leading case study firms. SPRU Annual Review - an overview of our research, teaching and other activities over the past year, including key research findings, select bibliographies and the work of DPhil students.</td>
