 To get this FREE software, click here Written by active and experienced LD coaches Authors reflect variety of styles and approaches to LD debate Includes discussion of all 10 LD resolutions on the NFL ballot Useful through December of 2002 for topics selected for competition Useful for years as a starting point for discussion of LD topics and concepts Useful bibliographies included This publication is designed to introduce debaters to the ten potential resolutions for National Forensic League competition in the year 2002. We make no claim to be the definitive word on any of these issues. Instead, the discussions are intended to stimulate thinking about the issues, and to provide a starting point for thoughtful analysis and research. Although only five of the resolutions included will actually be used in competition during the year 2002, each analysis provides commentary on issues that recur within Lincoln Douglas debate over a period of time. These will prove a useful resource for novice LD debaters as additional areas for analysis and research, and for more experienced competitors as they conceptualize arguments and strategies that transcend specific resolutions.</td>

 The Mental Health Foundation was established in 1949. It incorporates the Foundation for People with Learning Disabilities, which was established in 1998. The Foundation is the leading UK charity working to pioneer research and new approaches to supporting people with mental health problems and learning disabilities. In 2000, the Foundation extended its core work into dementia service development, although it had already funded two research initiatives and a small number of community projects in this field. It is now committed to developing a coherent programme of policy development, information, service development and research concerned with the broader agenda of mental health in later life.</td>
