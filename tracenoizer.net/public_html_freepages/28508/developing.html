 . It is not presently cost effective to mine these minerals and then bring them back to Earth. However, these raw materials could be used in developing the space structures and in generating the rocket fuel that will be required to explore and colonize our solar system in the twenty-first century. It has been estimated that the mineral wealth resident in the belt of asteroids between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter would be equivalent to about 100 billion dollars for every person on Earth today. Whereas asteroids are rich in the mineral raw materials required to build structures in space, the comets are rich resources for the water and carbon-based molecules necessary to sustain life.</td>

Back to Top Degree Days Analysis A quite common technique in apportioning energy use is to relate it to the degree days of the environment. We are quite fortunate in that the vast majority of the gas use is for heating (the chemists barely touch the stuff and there are no kitchens).</td>

 Ecological Footprint Calculator The Ecological Footprint Calculator measures our use of natural resources. It calculates how much land is required to produce all of the resources we consume and absorb all of the waste we produce. We are developing the Ecological Footprint Calculator as a tool for students to calculate their own personal ecological footprint, and to visualize their footprint in various ways (e. how many earths we would need if everyone on Earth had a footprint like theirs). an affiliate of the Concord Consortium, provides teacher training and inquiry-based science curricula.</td>
