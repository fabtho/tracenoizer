In addition, best-practice approaches to helping older people with mental health problems and their carers are also highlighted. For example, Geoff Watts describes the development of a specialist in-patient unit for older people with challenging behaviour; Alison Mariott examines the benefits of Family Therapy with functionally ill and cognitively impaired clients and their families; and Sue Hall explores the use of the internet by older people as a self-supportive tool. The feature article in this issue of Signpost is by Alisoun Milne and Jayne Lingard, who outline the work of the Mental Health Foundation in relation to older people with mental health problems and their families. Sadly, one thing missing from this issue and other 'functional illness' issues we have prepared in the past, are contributions from service users with later-life mental health problems and their carers.">

 Such a learning environment fosters freedom of expression and respect for others' opinions. It helps children to make their own decisions, to do what they believe to be right, while respecting the rights of others. The school and staff are committed to on-going professional development. Cohesive team-work is encouraged so that all staff feel fulfilled in their varying roles within the school, have a high level of effective communication with the school community and where a mutual feeling of support and respect exists. All parents are encouraged to participate in the development and maintenance of community relationships, with the school as the focus.</td>
