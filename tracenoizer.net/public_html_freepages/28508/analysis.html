 To get this FREE software, click here Written by active and experienced LD coaches Authors reflect variety of styles and approaches to LD debate Includes discussion of all 10 LD resolutions on the NFL ballot Useful through December of 2002 for topics selected for competition Useful for years as a starting point for discussion of LD topics and concepts Useful bibliographies included This publication is designed to introduce debaters to the ten potential resolutions for National Forensic League competition in the year 2002. We make no claim to be the definitive word on any of these issues. Instead, the discussions are intended to stimulate thinking about the issues, and to provide a starting point for thoughtful analysis and research. Although only five of the resolutions included will actually be used in competition during the year 2002, each analysis provides commentary on issues that recur within Lincoln Douglas debate over a period of time. These will prove a useful resource for novice LD debaters as additional areas for analysis and research, and for more experienced competitors as they conceptualize arguments and strategies that transcend specific resolutions.</td>

Team B data (university electricity) John Street Island Electricity Data window. Also, for this same week, the total consumption was metered for the Unicentre. For the purpose of the John Street Island analysis, the data required were accurate daily and yearly profiles. As such, by subtracting the metered weekly consumption for the Unicentre, we calculated the weekly consumption for the John Street Island. These daily profiles were used as our reference scenario in the feasibility study for the John Street Island.</td>
