 Mike Coates, Paul Scott, Paul Sammarco, and Terry Piva. Extracurricular activities include President of the Council of Postgraduate Students, Director of CQUSA, ballroom dancing, and scuba diving. With the opening of the Mackay CQU campus, I have been able to interview first year education students, as they will be the first to graduate here. I am enrolled full time, and have an interest in the completion and competencies of university students, including the structure of all support groups, such as student associations and mentoring. Using the process sociology of Norbert Elias and Henning Eichberg I hope to further our understanding contemporary sports such as the triathlon.</td>
