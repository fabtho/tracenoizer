 Therefore, when data is written to the file, it is written to the cache and not immediately flushed to the redirector. The cache manager flushes the data at a later time. If an unrecoverable network error occurs while the data is being transferred to the remote server, it may cause the write request to fail and the above application popup to occur. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can be solved. Disable this parameter only to guarantee that all data is flushed to the server immediately after it is written by the application.</td>
