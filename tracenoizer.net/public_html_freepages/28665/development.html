 We help communities to acquire leadership skills, recognise and develop their strengths and grasp economic opportunities. Such wide-ranging activities build confidence and the quality of life within the Highlands and Islands. A key element for developing the strengths and leadership capabilities of our rural communities is through the use of European programmes, particularly LEADER II which is one of the main initiatives aimed at encouraging community-based economic and social development. This programme complements other Network activity by focusing resources on small scale, locally developed action plans. This is evident through our participation in community planning and partnerships with a number of bodies, such as the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations and the Scottish Museums Council.</td>
