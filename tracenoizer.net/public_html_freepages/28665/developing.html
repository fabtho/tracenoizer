Such wide-ranging activities build confidence and the quality of life within the Highlands and Islands. A key element for developing the strengths and leadership capabilities of our rural communities is through the use of European programmes, particularly LEADER II which is one of the main initiatives aimed at encouraging community-based economic and social development. This programme complements other Network activity by focusing resources on small scale, locally developed action plans. This is evident through our participation in community planning and partnerships with a number of bodies, such as the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations and the Scottish Museums Council.</td>

 These programs now more than ever must rely on pro bono lawyers, said Judge Judith M. Billings of the Utah Court of Appeals, Salt Lake City, chair of the ABA Standing Committee. The goal of conference planners is to encourage development of local teams of community leaders committed to developing new strategies to expand and enhance delivery of civil legal aid to the poor, said Billings. The conference will focus on the value of local partnerships and collaboration to develop, expand and enhance civil legal aid programs. Sessions will help registrants identify and find ways to remove barriers to forming new partnerships, and will offer a mix of examples of innovative strategies already in use in pro bono programs around the country.</td>
