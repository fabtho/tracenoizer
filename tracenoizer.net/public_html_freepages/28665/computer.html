 i have no association with either of these companies. i merely came across these products which interested me, and i felt they would probably interest a whole lot of you. Like the 1st one above, this can be connected to your computer if you want to. Apparently, a kind gesture is pointless unless it doesnt take up your time. to those of you who complained about what a large file it was.</td>

 The UM-SI CN Initiative is one of several projects being developed at the University of Michigan under the auspices of a major five-year grant from the W. Kellogg Foundation known as the Coalition on Reinventing Information Science, Technology, and Library Education (CRISTAL-ED). Several SI living laboratory projects which employ practical engagement are designed to bring realistic learning experiences to students, faculty, and practitioners through the application of computer technology to problem solving. The UM-SI CN Initiative uses practical engagement to provide students with opportunities to apply, reinforce, and master skills and knowledge from previous learning experiences in actual settings. It also provides ample opportunity for learning (often unanticipated, but extremely valuable) to occur as a result of working in the community living laboratory setting.</td>
