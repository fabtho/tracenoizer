 Plans include turning the bottom portion into a community center. The goal, says Devon Holloway, vice president of Old Fourth Ward Redevelopment Inc. That includes, for example, making it possible for groups to have a place to meet and for senior citizens to be able to pay their utility bills without having to go all the way downtown. Additionally, tutorial and after-school programs are being planned for youth in the community. "Our vision is to make the community strong again, to make the community aware that we have a group that's working and looking out for the community's needs," says Holloway.</td>
