 We chose to use MSXML as it is one of the fastest and most robust XML parsers available. There are times however, where it may be preferable to use a different parser perhaps to accommodate design requirements or to experiment with new parser features. The User Tools feature of XMLwriter allows you to do this and more. Configure your favorite parser and then validate documents using it with one click. Convert documents with an external XSL engine and capture the results into a new document.</td>
