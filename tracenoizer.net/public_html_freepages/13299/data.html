It's like a mapping software package combined with a database plus analytics. Practitioners also regard the total GIS software or mapping software solution as including operating personnel and the data that go into the system. A GIS, which can use information from many different sources, in many different forms can help with such analyses. The primary requirement for the GIS source data is that the locations for the variables are known.">

 This includes all active sites listed in the book, plus other useful sites. See several of the web sites listed below for additional slides and lecture notes. The cnet network simulator enables experimentation with various data link layer, network layer, routing and transport layer protocols, and with various network configurations. It is available at a discount for courses using this textbook. This tool enables students to write connection oriented data link protocols and have them tested on a simulated communication channel.</td>
