 Here you can see us trying to escape the vicous crowd. He just got some ketchup on his head in the mosh pit. He only sings in Butterflies for the Summertime, because Jon can't play and sing at the same time. But don't worry, we blew off their butts with cybernetic bioweapons after the show. Sorry we don't have any live pictures of Josh drumming.</td>

 Instead he's more like a guy who knows how to do a lot of shit. . Part of the fun in watching and listening to Josh play is you never know what you are going to get. One night he'll pull out the most soulful and beautiful solos, and the next night he'll play vicious, aggressive in-your-face lines while lying on his back. For example, compare his sublime work on "Sinner Music" off The Jongleurs self-titled debut with his screaming solo on "Save Me" on the "Five People" CD.</td>

 The band has been together for less than half a year, but has already recorded 2 demo CD's and has played shows all across North Carolina and Florida. Justin Harvey and Stephen Beeson decided to get a band together in the spring of 2001 at Appalachian State University. They wanted to go against the trends of the scene and play fast melodic punk as opposed to the emo, and acoustic college rock that rules the area. After auditioning several guitar players who wanted to play pop punk and emo, they decided to put Josh on guitar and search for a drummer. After a couple weeks of searching the band settled on a less than par drummer.</td>
