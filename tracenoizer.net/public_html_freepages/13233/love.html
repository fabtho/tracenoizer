 Paul, where we shot this movie and so I got to be real good friends with him and he'd take me to the ins and outs, all the good spots, and we hung out with his friends from college and stuff and it was great. I bet you'll like him even more when you see him as Trip Fontaine. He's always hiding under his hat brim because of the many teenage girls who are so in love with him. He is particularly at risk for this as he is so very PRETTY. .</td>
