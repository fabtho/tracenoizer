 I tell you, I mean, you have to wear blinders to be able to look at a face like that. He appeals to the girls so much because when you're with him you know its dangerous, but he makes you feel safe. Paul, where we shot this movie and so I got to be real good friends with him and he'd take me to the ins and outs, all the good spots, and we hung out with his friends from college and stuff and it was great. I bet you'll like him even more when you see him as Trip Fontaine. He's always hiding under his hat brim because of the many teenage girls who are so in love with him.</td>

 . Dad got really excited when he noticed the moving van next door, especially when he saw the cool stuff they were unloading. Mom said it was clean slate, a chance for us to make friends for a change. But we had to act fast, before the other neighbors got to them first. Josh seemed okay, but then he told my dad that I spit on his hamburger.</td>

 He used to bring these exquisite desserts to work for all to sample. I did not get the pie made out of potatoes, but I am sure it was delicious. I do know that we are still friends today, and for that I am grateful. Oh, I better not forget to put in a plug for Josh's book. that way, maybe he won't care that I, uh, borrowed his picture.</td>
