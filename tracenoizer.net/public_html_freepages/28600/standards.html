 Thayer The creation of quality software on time and within budget has been a major problem facing the software industry for several decades. Consideration of software development and maintenance as an engineering discipline to control the developmental process can help alleviate these obstacles. This new book focuses on the best practices for software process improvement (SPI) and related international standards providing a valuable guide and reference. The text is a collection of original and republished papers providing a significant survey on the use of SPI and software process assessment (SPA) as practiced by companies such as Lockheed Martin, Siemens, and Hewlett Packard. Among the important features of the book are chapters on software process evaluation, how to best perform SPI, ISO 9000 and TickIT-an alternative approach to SPA, as well as the latest information on the CMM integration project.</td>

 Such process conformance was never intended to give such a guarantee anyway. Your ISO9000 auditors don't know how good your product is, that isn't their area of expertise. They know about process, and can measure your conformance to your defined process and measure your process itself against the standards, but it is the people in your own industry that must judge your product. The guarantee it does provide is the inverse of this. Process conformance is a necessary (but not sufficient) pre-requisite to the consistent production of a high-quality product.</td>
