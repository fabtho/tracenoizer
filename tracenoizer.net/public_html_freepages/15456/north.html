 A complex of tunnels, guns, searchlights and other fortifications make this a fascinating area to explore. It is now a historic reserve managed by the Department of Conservation. Getting there From Devonport, follow King Edward Parade along the waterfront and you will see signs to North Head. Ferries run regularly between downtown Auckland and Devonport. A tour bus runs from the ferry to North Head seven days a week, meeting the ferries from 10am to 3pm.</td>
