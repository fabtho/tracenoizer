 This piece revolves around the various relationships between individual players and groups (or tribes) of players. There are layers of drama and theatre, with individual relationships developing simultaneously. These express themselves in the rhythmic, energetic music which is a reaction to the oppresive and harmonically static music, dominated by the groups. This piece is dedicated to some good friends, who supported me in all sorts of ways as I was writing it. He is currently a DPhil student with Martin Butler at Sussex University.</td>
