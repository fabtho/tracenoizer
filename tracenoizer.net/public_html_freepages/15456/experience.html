 A Word from Pastor T WHY I LOVE TEENAGERS One of the reasons why I have such a special love for teenagers is because I experienced quite a few problems during my teenage years. As a matter of fact, I would even go so far as to describe my teen years as the most difficult years of my entire life. If that is true then I praise the Lord for your experience (and secretly wish that it could have been my own experience). This was very unsettling for me because I was the most popular boy in my grade. But Wheelersburg was a larger school with better athletes and better students.</td>

 . The Eyes of Pollard an online magazine created by middle school kids The Friday Bulletin What is happening at Pollard this week. They experience rapid physiological changes, heightened emotional sensitivity, an emerging sense of self, and an increasing need for self-assertion. Cognitively, middle school students move from concrete toward abstract thinking. A pervasive yearning for self-acceptance and belonging also shapes their behavior and perceptions.</td>
