 Healthy connections with adults are vital in recognizing and reinforcing a middle school student's sense of worth and the ability to balance extreme and competing developmental needs. Our students also face a rapidly changing world which challenges them to deal with many complex issues. We believe that a positive working relationship with parents and community is of vital importance to support our children in this challenging task. Together, we must engage students in a rigorous program that sets high expectations and provides opportunities for all learners to be successful. When students leave the middle school, they should feel pride in who they are, what they stand for, and what they have learned.</td>

 What bothers me so much is that Jonathan Pollard's punishment does not fit his crime. However, I then realized there is no sensible explanation for the length of Jonathan Pollard's imprisonment, especially since he was only trying to help Israel, an ally of the United States. So, I am writing this letter asking you to please join the Jewish community in helping Jonathan Pollard. You can involve yourself in the mitzvah of redeeming captives. One way to help is by writing letters to President Clinton expressing our feelings of injustice on this issue.</td>

 You may already belong to the Body of Christ by virtue of baptism. You may already belong to God by your honor for what you know to be good, true, and beautiful. Embracing every truth and engaging in every good work, this Christian community invites you to join us in the effort to spread the good news and restore the unity of the Christian family. Hopefully, there are ways that we can assist God's work of salvation in your life. When I was told of my friend's violent death, I renewed my hope that she find her home in heaven.</td>
