 The handbook is a resource to help you make the most of your college career. It is your responsibility to consult the Administrative Assistant in room 1303 James Hall to obtain a copy of current revisions and errata for this handbook each semester. Pursuant to this policy, the college (1) will provide individual reasonable accommodations and (2) will make structural modifications to existing facilities if no other feasible way exists to make a program or activity accessible, as long as no individual accommodation or structural modification would (1) fundamentally alter the nature of the program or (2) result in an undue financial burden or hardship on the college.
