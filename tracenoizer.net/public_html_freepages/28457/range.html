 The resolution in gel filtration is dependent on column length, the flow rate of elution, pore size of the gel, and the particle size of the gel bead. In general, the efficiency, and therefore the resolution, of any chromatographic analysis improves as the size of the gel bead decreases. The pore size of the gel determines the molecular weight range over which separation will occur. The column length is important in gel filtration, and resolution generally increases with increasing column length. However, increasing column length eventually degrades resolution due to diffusion of the sample as it transverses the gel filtration column.</td>

 Frequency The number of times each second that an object, such as a string on a guitar or violin, vibrates. Frequency Modulation (FM) Synthesis Sound wave patterns are represented by variations of the frequency applied to a carrier signal. This technology was first used in FM radios, then it was applied to sound waves in the audio range. The first experiments were conducted at Stanford, by Dr. Later this technology was used in the Yamaha DX series, than later the SY series, professional synthesizers.</td>
