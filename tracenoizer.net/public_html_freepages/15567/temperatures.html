 . NDBC Science Pages Does water temperature differ between near-shore and offshore sites. The graph shows the average monthly water temperatures from Station 46029 and Station 46005. These two stations are on the same latitude -- about 46 degrees North latitude. Look at the data for November (month 11), Station 46029 has an average water temperature of 11 degrees while Station 46005 has an average water temperature of 13 degrees.</td>

 Temperature tables (except Hawaii, Alaska, and Pacific Islands table) were originally created in the early 1980s by former NODC meteorologist Richard M. . These average water temperatures were computed from long-period records ranging from several years to several decades depending on how long observations have been taken at a given station. Although ocean conditions vary from year to year, water temperatures are less variable than air temperatures, so these averages can provide useful information for planning beach activities such as swimming or fishing. For the Gulf coast, only monthly averages are presented.</td>
