Kids in the Creek Water Temperature Water temperature is one of the most important factors for survival of aquatic life. Most aquatic organisms become the temperature of the water that surrounds them. Their metabolic rates are controlled by water temperature.</td>

 Why do you think the freezing points are different. As seawater increases 5 ppt in salinity, the freezing point decreases by 0. The ocean can be divided into three vertical zones, depending on temperature. The top layer is the surface layer, or mixed layer. This layer is the most easily influenced with solar energy (the sun's heat), wind and rain.</td>

 Thermal pollution is the introduction of warm water or other substrates into an aquatic ecosystem. Sources include industries such as power plants and also storm-drain runoff which has been warmed on streets, parking lots and sidewalks. In addition, human activities such as cutting down trees, the removal of vegetation around the water, and construction can lead to an increase in water temperature. These practices can cause an increase in erosion which leads to an increase in dissolved solids in the water. As dissolved solids increase, the water becomes turbid or cloudy which allows the absorption of the sun's rays which increases the water temperature.</td>
