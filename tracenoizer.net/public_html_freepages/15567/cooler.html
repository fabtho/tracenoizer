 It has a "T" trough that lets you install the cooler at different angles. .PC Cooling - Computer System Coolers - Cables N Mor System Coolers This is a high-performance cooler for your computer system. It cools down the inside of your case by creating air flow. A strong fan draws out the air around your motherboard, your drives, cards, etc.</td>

 Other trademarks are property of their respective owners. . for supplying us with this cooler (and a few others to be reviewed later). Well here we go, time to look at this pretty unique piece. After looking at almost every possible system cooler on the market (to my knowledge), I felt disappointed to find the same thing over and over.</td>

 It looks very much like the squirrel blowers you get from the local Radio Shack. Just screw the unit to an empty PCI or ISA slot and connect the power connector to the power supply. I was able to remove my AMK Super Slot Cooler and install the Vantec PCSC-100 in about 2 minutes. Spec wise, the PCSC-100 should out perform the AMK unit. How much it out performs the AMK Super Slot Cooler by will determine weather it's worth the extra money.</td>
