The relative impacts and interactions between galling, deer browsing, and fire on C. herbaceous growth and architecture were investigated by comparing numbers of shoots, buds, and inflorescences; bud vitality; and herbivory rates between plants on an annually burned and an infrequently burned watershed. herbaceous growth patterns, reducing the number of shoots per ramet, increasing ramets per plant and shoot length, and preventing sexual reproduction. The effects of herbivory were much weaker than those of fire.</td>
