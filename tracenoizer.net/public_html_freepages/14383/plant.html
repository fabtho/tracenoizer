 COD data from the columns were fitted to a first-order model, modified to include a nonzero asymptote. Assessments of other data were performed using effluent-to-influent concentration ratios and moving average plots of influent and effluent concentrations. Plant effects on COD kinetics were noted in many cases, with Carex and Scirpus generally producing better degradation than Typha or control treatments. Effects of temperature on kinetics were substantial, although the Carex and Scirpus treatments seemed less sensitive. Plant effects on COD removal were less noticeable in the subsurface-flow wetlands, but temperature effects were apparent.</td>

 The effects of shading on vegetative resource allocation in Laportea canadensis. Spatial preference of foragers in the ant Formica rufa obscuripes Forel. in association to ant, insect and plant relationships. Color discrimination in American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus). Voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus) effect on boxelder (Acer negundo) seedling survival and succession in old fields.</td>
