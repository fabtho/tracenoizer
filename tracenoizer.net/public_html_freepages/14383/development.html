 . Yet far too many children, especially those from poor and minority families, are placed at risk by school practices that are based on a sorting paradigm in which some students receive high-expectations instruction while the rest are relegated to lower quality education and lower quality futures. The mission of the Center for Research on the Education of Students Placed At Risk (CRESPAR) is to conduct the research, development, evaluation, and dissemination needed to transform schooling for students placed at risk.

 My research centers on the speech segmentation and recognition process in infants. James Morgan and graduate student Leher Singh of Brown University in pursuit of answers to questions about the relation between speech perception and language acquisition in preverbal infants. In ongoing research, we are examining the development of infants' recognition of familiar words in fluent speech. In another line of research, I am collaborating with Dr. Julie Sedivy and graduate student Aparna Nadig on a project in which we are trying to establish the age at which pragmatic knowledge becomes useful to children and how that knowledge interacts with specific syntactic biases in the input.</td>

 My doctoral research focuses on determining how to facilitate effective web based teaching and learning for higher levels of learning. As the web is being increasingly adopted in all areas of education, acquiring an understanding of how to facilitate effective learning with this medium has become crucial. The outcome of this research was the development of validated principles and identified unresolved issues in the implementation web-based instruction as a platform for delivery in distance learning. I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Athabasca University. This current research project focuses on investigating the impact of open and distance learning in higher education communities.</td>
