 Studies have shown that in the Antarctic, the amount of UVB measured at the surface can double during the annual ozone hole. Another study confirmed the relationship between reduced ozone and increased UVB levels in Canada during the past several years. Effects on Human Health Laboratory and epidemiological studies demonstrate that UVB causes nonmelanoma skin cancer and plays a major role in malignant melanoma development. All sunlight contains some UVB, even with normal ozone levels. It is always important to limit exposure to the sun.</td>

 COD data from the columns were fitted to a first-order model, modified to include a nonzero asymptote. Assessments of other data were performed using effluent-to-influent concentration ratios and moving average plots of influent and effluent concentrations. Plant effects on COD kinetics were noted in many cases, with Carex and Scirpus generally producing better degradation than Typha or control treatments. Effects of temperature on kinetics were substantial, although the Carex and Scirpus treatments seemed less sensitive. Plant effects on COD removal were less noticeable in the subsurface-flow wetlands, but temperature effects were apparent.</td>
