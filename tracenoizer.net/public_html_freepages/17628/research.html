 "A lot of people really question the idea of forcing students to watch advertisements on school time," said Tamara Schwartz, a program coordinator for the Center for Commercial-Free Public Education. The Oakland based non-profit group was formed in 1993 to oppose Channel One but has since addressed other forms of classroom advertising. "Research on this subject shows that students subjected to ads in school have difficulty differentiating between advertising and other information," Schwartz said. "And when a product is advertised in a school, they tend to see that product as carrying the school's endorsement. " Though Schwartz hadn't seen the screen savers, she said she doubts they would raise enough money to offset the damage done to children.</td>
