 The team observed that some 20 participants have followed the taught component of the EngD since 1998 but, during that time, have been registered temporarily on the MSc programme. While in South Africa, the team learnt that there were now some 73 EngD candidates who had enrolled with Morgan (see below, paragraphs 23 and 27). Over 100 participants are now registered on this programme at WMG, and as the numbers above indicate, the degree is proving to be a very popular choice in South Africa. Although University staff spend considerable amounts of time in South Africa delivering modules, the audit team learnt that Morgan manages the recruitment of South African students and forwards applications to the University for formal registration. From the reports of various WMG committees, the team noted with concern that some applications were still incomplete up to 18 months after the student had commenced study and, in some cases, where they had already completed modules.</td>
