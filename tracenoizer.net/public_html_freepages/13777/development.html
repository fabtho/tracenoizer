 15, 1998 Oakland Technical High School students presented plans for redesigning the MacArthur BART station and area to a panel of jurors April 8 at Oakland City Hall. The Oakland Tech students developed their plans with the help of Berkeley graduate students through the Urban Plan project. Jurors included local politicians, community groups, development organizations and educators. Among them were Jane Brunner, Oakland City councilwoman; Alex Greenwood and Gladys Moore of the City of Oakland Community and Economic Development Agency; Walter Miles of the MLK-Telegraph Business Association; Lynne Horiuchi of Turning Leaves and the U. Environmental Protection Agency; and Carlos Castellanos of the Spanish Speaking Unity Council.</td>

 The Unity Council led the community creating the transit village site plan. Once the site plan was a reality, the Unity Council received funds to investigate former land uses in the area. As is typical of urban infill development, the study determined that the project would be built on a brownfield site. The Unity Council expressed concern that the previous uses may have contaminated the subsurface and may have remained under the BART parking lot. Therefore, a subsurface investigation would be necessary before construction could begin.</td>
