 Archbishop Peter Jensen will be the speaker of this event. . Fellowship of Overseas Christian University Students (FOCUS) meets regularly at the University of New South Wales (UNSW), Sydney Australia, and it is part of the St. FOCUS started 17 years ago when a small group of overseas and Australian students gathered together to study the Bible. We meet on Fridays and Sundays to study God's Word in large meetings and smaller groups, to have fellowship together as a church, and to build each other up in the hope we all share.</td>
