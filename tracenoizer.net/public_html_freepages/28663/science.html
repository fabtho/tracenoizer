 Yet much of this information can be used by prospective buyers for assessing a vendor's product and support processes. The book is thoughtfully organized and contains many useful illustrations that help the reader visualize the material that is presented. There is some math in this book that is unavoidable (this is a applied science book). As an engineer its almost impossible for me to understand how an intelligent treatment of a subject such as reliability engineering could be accomplished otherwise. I recommend this book without reservation, to anyone interested in this multifaceted subject.</td>
