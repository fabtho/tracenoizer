 I must have made 150 at least during the last six months. Those of you who know me also know that I have many other projects and collaborations which have been keeping me busy throughout the Winter months, such as DEFL. On top of this my own solo projects which are OCTAGON a deep experimental ambient soundscape affair which toys with the psyche, ADRANTEK an Intelligent Warp records style project and DISCOSLUT which is just a bit of fun really. Cut and Paste Disco loops with my own sounds on top. Funny cause the first reaction I get to all of my side projects is to immediately gain feature status at MP3.</td>
