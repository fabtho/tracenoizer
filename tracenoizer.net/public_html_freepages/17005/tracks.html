 COM CD which is available in the stores throughout Europe. This ten tracker is by the far the most banging of my releases to date. Featuring the tracks "High Density" soon to be released under the name 'SOLVENT ELECTRON INDUSTRIES' for HOLZPLATTEN records Germany, and also the track "Autotrim" which will appear on the German KATSUMI label under the name 'RONIN' A CD crammed full of really amazing remixes of my tracks , done by some of the most amazing new producers around. This one is an absolute MUST HEAR item which I can highly recommend to you. It contains no less than nine of my most baging head wrecking tracks.</td>
