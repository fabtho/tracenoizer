<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" Firstly that it contains my first single release 'Dijitaal' which came out through the German SIMPLE MUZIK label and completely SOLD OUT after only two weeks in the stores. Secondly it has the track 'Channel Zero' which was chosen by Derrick May (the so-called Godfather of Techno) in his MP3. 'Me and my Machine' is a much deeper release from my usual heads down style, and features several of my own personal favourites including the track 'Freespace' which was chosen by top French Techno DJ LAURENT HO to appear on the WWW. COM CD which is available in the stores throughout Europe. This ten tracker is by the far the most banging of my releases to date.">
