And I'm given courage to do so by the hope that whole will be seen as having some value not as mere confessional autobiography but as a document of some historical value, a record of one person's inner and outer experience in America during the sixties and the beginnings of the seventies, an experience which is shared by so many and which transcends the peculiar details of each life, though it can only be expressed through those details. Linda Wagner-Martin It is a commonplace of contemporary criticism that modern poetic techniques are inadequate to sustain a long poem.">
