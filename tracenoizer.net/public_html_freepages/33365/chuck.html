<meta name="Description" lang=" "content=" Vitor told FCF he hasn't heard anything about Mike Van Arsdale as an opponent as of yet, despite all the rumors about a fight between the two. At this point Belfort's participation at the September event isn't certain, but he plans to be prepared and hopes the UFC will use him on the card, against Van Arsdale or any other opponent. Belfort also commented that he feels he was doing well in his fight against Chuck until the knockdown in the third round, and he feels Liddell is a great fighter so this loss won't take away his desire to fight again. With one fight left on his UFC contract, plus an extra fight guaranteed if the UFC wants it, Vitor Belfort's career in the UFC can be long or short, depending on the outcome of his next fight. FCF will keep a close eye on the Phenom's training developments as the September UFC card takes shape.">
