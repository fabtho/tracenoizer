 Our plan was to review Theresa's police file -- stored away and gathering dust in the Sherbrooke police office. I was expecting John to be a nervous wreck, but he was quite the opposite. He had been running around Sherbrooke all day without a coat in spite of the cold, wearing only a light-blue cotton sweater. There was even a jauntiness about him, as if he felt huge relief that he was finally confronting his demons. His hotel room was littered with papers, news clippings, notebooks, the lights of his lap-top winking beside the coffee machine.</td>
