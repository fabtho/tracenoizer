 We also bring in guest speakers and assist in organizing the annual education career fair held on campus every year. All tickets and merchandise can be bought through them. They are a group of very hard working and dedicated students who not only organize and plan all of the events but also play a major role in the faculty. The executive members sit on all faculty committees ensuring that the students' voice is heard and works in close contact with faculty members to maintain an open line of communication between students and faculty.

 All acknowledged that obtaining the necessary data would be a substantial project requiring a considerable commitment of resources beyond that which is allocated to Lake monitoring today. Various components of the overall pollutant loading picture of the Lake are known or have recently been estimated from data that is available. For example, there are quite a few spot or point analyses of pollutant levels at most of the significant inflows into the Lake, such as at municipal discharge points and mouths of major tributaries. Generally lacking at these points to establish pollutant loading levels are volume flow measurements and a statistically significant number of samples over an extended period of time. Also notably lacking are measurements of non-point source inputs along the perimeter of the Lake.</td>
