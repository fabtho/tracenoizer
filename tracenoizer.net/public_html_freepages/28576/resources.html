 Two-way programs typically share the goals of bilingual proficiency, academic achievement, and positive cross-cultural attitudes and behaviors, but they vary a good deal in the approaches and strategies they use to work toward those goals. A host of local factors affect such issues as student enrollment, program features and design, and instructional features. Emerging results of studies of two-way bilingual programs point to their effectiveness in educating nonnative-English-speaking students, their promise of expanding our nation's language resources by conserving the native language skills of minority students and developing second language skills in English-speaking students, and their hope of improving relationships between majority and minority groups by enhancing cross-cultural understanding and appreciation. INTRODUCTION The best setting for educating linguistic minority pupils--and one of the best for educating any pupil--is a school in which two languages are used without apology and where becoming proficient in both is considered a significant intellectual and cultural achievement. Glenn, Principal, 1990 In a growing number of schools in the United States, students are learning through two languages in programs that aim to develop dual language proficiency along with academic achievement.</td>

 Neither the cumulative historical nor current total annual pollutant loadings in Lake Pontchartrain are known. Numerous authorities, agencies, foundations, and groups contacted said the annual pollutant loading into the Lake would be a valuable piece of information they would all like to have. All acknowledged that obtaining the necessary data would be a substantial project requiring a considerable commitment of resources beyond that which is allocated to Lake monitoring today. Various components of the overall pollutant loading picture of the Lake are known or have recently been estimated from data that is available. For example, there are quite a few spot or point analyses of pollutant levels at most of the significant inflows into the Lake, such as at municipal discharge points and mouths of major tributaries.</td>
