 Your readers may be interested in my work, since I often deal with fathers' issues and gender issues in my regularly published columns. If you're interested in posting any of my articles, please feel free to do so and please send me the URL so I can link to it from my site and send more readers your way. I found your extensive experience and insight on these very difficult cases gave me a better understanding of the nature of the problem. Thank you and the Parents Helping Parents organization for your dedication to advocate on behalf of parents and children who find themselves embroiled in serious allegations. I welcome hearing your impressions of the provincial consultations on the Divorce Act that you attended in June.</td>

 Deadline for submissions is midnight EST on the night of November 10. We'll post the times throughout this period and announce the winners on "race day," Saturday, January 26, 2001. Like real-life events, the Virtual Races are intended to be about more than competition and finishing times (though these certainly add to the fun); they are about sharing our common experience of straining toward the finish line. The Details Virtual Races are held for the 5K, 10K and marathon distances. All times must be from races between the stated dates.</td>

 The 2000 census found only 10 blacks in the neighborhood of about 3,300 residents. If they are met with open arms -- and if white residents don't begin to move out as more blacks move in -- historic patterns of division may begin to dissolve. "It's been a very welcoming experience," Williams said. The city is one of the whitest in America, and from housing controversies of the 1970s to discrimination complaints of recent years, has gained a reputation -- deserved or not -- as less than friendly to blacks. "I didn't want to shed any of that darkness on her decision," he said.</td>
