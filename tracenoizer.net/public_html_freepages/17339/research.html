 . Paper on YES Young Engineers and Scientists A Mentorship Program Using Information Technology The Goals of YES The Educational Benifits TeacherParticipation Acknowledgements Reference The Goals of YES The Primary goal of YES is to encourage talented students to pursue science and engineering majors in high school and college; first, by expanding career awareness including information on "hot" career areas an increased presence of working scientists and engineers in local high schools , secondly, by allowing students to interact on a continuing basis with role models at SwRI. SwRI staff members, including females and minorities, recruit YES participants from local high schools by presenting talks and slide shows about their ongoing research projects. These presentations are given on a volunteer basis. During the academic school year, displays and presentations of the participants' work in the local schools increase the benefits of the YES program by spreading career awareness to other students and teachers.</td>
