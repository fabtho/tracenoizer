 In general terms it allows for enhanced communication of data by allowing users to explore and interact with a representation of the data within a computer generated 3-Dimensional environment. The user is able to control and interact with what they can see using a variety of input devices. Various commercial systems are available which will allow for varying degrees of immersion. Once a user is inside the room the image can be projected onto the walls simultaneously providing the user with a sense of full immersion. Multiple users can enter the space however one user can control the view using current head tracking technology.</td>

 If you encounter any afs access problems, please submit a cts ticket with an "AFS" Problem Type. At present we are rebooting both the storage and the host. Upon successfull rebooting, the afs salvager will kick in, to check for the integrity of the file systems. This check will take anywhere between 30 min and 60 min, depending on how many file systems will need repair. I will post another announcement once the problem is solved.</td>

 Your password will expire every six months, or six months from the last time you re-set or change it (unless your departmental network manager has selected another expiration interval for your department -- check with your network manager for expiration rules for your unit). To get back in immediately, just go to VIP and return to the Technology tab to re-set your password. Setting your password through VIP changes your password for all these participating systems. Changing your password directly on any of these participating networks or applications also changes your password for Blackboard. Check with your departmental computer support staff if you have questions about participating systems.</td>
