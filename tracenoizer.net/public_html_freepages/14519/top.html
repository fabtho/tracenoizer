 Sides jumped out to an early lead until lap eight when Winker took the lead for one lap before Sides regained the lead on lap nine, then Winker took the lead back on lap 10 on the tight, little third-mile speedplant. Winker then lead until Moulis came charging to take the lead on lap 32. Finishing third in his Gumout Series debut was Jac Haudenschild, with Jason Sides finishing fourth and Daryn Pittman rounding out the top five. The Huggins Cams Fast Time went to Ronald Laney with a time of 13. Heat race wins went to Laney, Joe Roe, Sides, and Winker.</td>
