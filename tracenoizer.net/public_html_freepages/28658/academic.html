 The major is designed by the student and is subject to approval by faculty advisers and appropriate college committees.

 The Committee on Curriculum and Instruction must approve all changes to an individual major. . A student interested in designing an individual major must explain why her academic interests are not adequately addressed through these existing departmental and interdepartmental programs. Likewise, the proposed individual major must represent and be described as a meaningful program of interdepartmental coursework built around a specific departmental concentration. Finally, it should include both theoretical and methodological work at the advanced level.</td>

 Students need to know and understand the current climate regarding legal use of information in order to avoid the pitfalls of plagiarism, copyright infringement, and violation of fair use guidelines. Plagiarism If you do not acknowledge the source, you are, in effect, stealing material from another writer. This is a serious offense within the academic world. Proper citation of sources is the best safeguard against plagiarism. Under certain conditions specified in the Law, libraries and archives are authorized to furnish a photocopy or other reproduction.</td>
