 In becoming individual major advisors, faculty are agreeing to work closely with the student to assure that her selection of courses and their proposed sequencing represent a strong and coherent program of study. The two faculty advisors are expected to meet jointly with the student to develop her major plan and should continue to meet with her once each term after the major has been approved. Prior to graduation, both advisors are required to certify that the student has fulfilled all requirements for the major as outlined in her approved plan of study. Once the plan has been discussed and approved, the proposal form should be completed by the student, signed by both advisors, and submitted to the Class Dean or Dean of Continuing Education. After the Dean's signature has been obtained, please return to Jennifer Lewis (Registrar's office) for presentation to the CCI for final approval.</td>

 The minor is certified on the student's transcript. The double major program is still another alternative offered by the Colleges of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Engineering, and Letters and Science, but one which leaves even less time for elective courses. The double major requires approval by the appropriate faculty advisers and dean, and students must show that there is a significant difference between the disciplines and requirements of both majors involved. Cross-college majors can be developed with majors in two different colleges. For further information about any of these programs, contact the respective colleges.</td>
