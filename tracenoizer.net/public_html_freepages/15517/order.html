 Elizabeth (1207-1231) was a princess, the daughter of King Alexander II of Hungary. After her husband was killed in the Crusades, Elizabeth left the court. She made arrangements for the care of her three children and became a Franciscan tertiary (lay person associated with a religious order). Elizabeth built a hospital at Marburg and cared for the sick until her death in 1231. .</td>

 The registers before this time were kept by churches, so requesting a record before 1895, always indicate the faith of the concerned persons. Please always state your relationship to the person whose certificate you request. Please send the consular fee in a money order made out to the name of the contacted foreign mission of Hungary in the United States, and a self addressed and stamped envelope for certified mail. Your request shall be forwarded to the competent Hungarian authority. Generally, it takes about 3-4 months to obtain the document, and you will be informed about the arrival of the requested certificate.</td>

 The centennial of the gothic masterpiece provides us with a good pretext to dive back into the life of this machiavellian fifteenth century leader - an initiative that will enable us to better appreciate the work of Stoker. Vlad Tepes was born in November or December 1431, in the fortress of Sighisoara, Romania. His father, Vlad Dracul, at that time appointed military governor of Transylvania by the emperor Sigismund, had been inducted into the Order of the Dragon about one year before. The order - which could be compared to the Knights of the Hospital of St. John or even to the Teutonic Order of Knights - was a semimilitary and religious society, originally created in 1387 by the Holy Roman Emperor and his second wife, Barbara Cilli.</td>
