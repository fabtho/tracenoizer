 He had married Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon in 1923 and their eldest daughter, Elizabeth, was born in 1926. . The British monarchy continued to evolve in the twentieth century, shedding many of its Germanic links in the First World War when, in 1917, King George V decided to change the family name to Windsor. Edward was a popular personality but government ministers were concerned about his tendency to interfere in policy-making and his pro-German sympathies, which seemed to run against the constitutional position that the king was only supposed to act with their advice. The problem crystallised over his determination to marry the American divorcee, Wallis Simpson, against the advice of his ministers and that of the Prime Ministers of the Dominions.</td>

 The answers, of course, lie in examining the story of Countess Elizabeth Bathory. Born in 1560 to George Bathory (Ecsed branch) and Anna Bathory (Somlyo branch), Elizabeth was yet another product of the intermarriage between the dwindling Hungarian noble families. The Bathory family was "one of the richest and most powerful Protestant families in all Hungary. To receive some insight into the soul of Elizabeth, the presentation of an incident during her childhood could prove enlightening. Though it is not stated exactly when, occurring sometime after she turned six and before eleven, a band of gypsies were invited to her home at Ecsed Castle to provide entertainment at the court.</td>

 Wallachia first emerged as a political entity during the late thirteenth century from the weltering confusion left behind in the Balkans as the East Roman Empire slowly crumbled. The first prince of Wallachia was Basarab the Great (1310-1352), an ancestor of Dracula. Despite the splintering of the family into two rival, clans some member of the House of Basarab continued to govern Wallachia from that time until well after the Ottomans reduced the principality to the status of a client state. Dracula was the last prince of Wallachia to retain any real measure of independence. In order to understand the life of Vlad Dracula it is first necessary to understand something about the nature of Wallachian society and politics.</td>
