 This is present as well in Empedocles and in Democritus. We cannot say, therefore, that concern with man begins with the Sophists. It is rather the quality and causes of this concern that make the Sophists a breed apart and allow them to play an important if transitional role in the development of Greek thought. It is not a negligible fact that the Sophists do not figure in the sketch of previous philosophy Aristotle gives at the outset of his Metaphysics. In that sketch Aristotle is intent on pointing out previous efforts to arrive at the various principles of explanation of the things that are.</td>

 I just got in from work and a business trip, and the books were in the mail box. I have opened it enough to skim, and it looks beautiful. Have not had time to read, but I thought you might want to know it was here. Cathie Hudson I got my book yesterday and have really enjoyed it. I keep looking to see if any of the Little's were at Gorman where Thomas Roberts died.</td>

 Though I got a great job and all, I still have a lot of debts to get rid of, and I'm still living at home. And I really don't want to get engaged until I'm ready to get married. I have always thought it to be stupid to be engaged for a long period of time before marriage, it make no sense. Ellie, however, wants to be engaged now and get married after she graduates college, which will be in two or three years. I'm pretty sure we will work something out, if we don't kill ourselves over it first lol.</td>
