 The backup procedure works fine, but the restore is tricky. Hey Fred, did you save that posting about restoring filesystems with vi and a toothpick. It is only a minor upgrade, the system should be back up in a few hours. I think we can plug just one more thing in to this outlet strip without tripping the breaker. What is all this I hear about static charges destroying computers.</td>
