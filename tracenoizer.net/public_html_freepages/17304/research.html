 Most commercial stations in this country lose money, so there is a constant scramble to stay in the front of the pack, among the minority of profitable ones. That means always trying to reach a sizable enough audience to attract advertisers; serving a narrow niche is not an option. In public radio there is less agreement about the assumptions behind the research. As a result, professional researchers who have no personal experience in programming classical music or jazz or folk music may not pay attention to the differences between commercial music research and the research of public radio music formats. Too often this step is neglected, as if everyone already agrees on how the research is to be applied.</td>
