 This approach is proving successful in the development of tools to promote shared decision making, and in the design and dissemination of systematic reviews. We need to find effective strategies to include these stakeholders in research decisions and to evaluate the effect of this involvement on the quality and impact of RCTs. Researchers should also understand the limitations of RCTs, feel comfortable with the fact that there are many situations in which RCTs are not feasible or appropriate, and recognise that the question being asked is what should determine the study design that can best answer it. 8 We need trials to provide more precise results The biomedical literature is plagued with small studies that provide imprecise answers to complex questions. Increasing the sample size of RCTs to achieve the precision needed to answer important questions often requires efficient collaboration among different groups of researchers, often working in different countries.</td>
