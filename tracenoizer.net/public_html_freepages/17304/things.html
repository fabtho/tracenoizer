 It is rather the quality and causes of this concern that make the Sophists a breed apart and allow them to play an important if transitional role in the development of Greek thought. It is not a negligible fact that the Sophists do not figure in the sketch of previous philosophy Aristotle gives at the outset of his Metaphysics. In that sketch Aristotle is intent on pointing out previous efforts to arrive at the various principles of explanation of the things that are. The absence of the Sophists from this historical summary would lead to the conclusion that their interests were quite different from those of others Aristotle finds important for his purposes. Now if philosophers we have considered previously were concerned with man -- with human existence, with man's place in the universe -- this was not their only concern.</td>
