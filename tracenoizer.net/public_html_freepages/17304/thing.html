 . If you have a minute, please sign my Dreambook too. I like that spinning Icon thing that's on the main page. I was in the Reserves for 25 years and was looking for some information for my daughter when I ran across your page. I am in the process of putting together a web page and was wondering how to do it.</td>

 Hey Fred, did you save that posting about restoring filesystems with vi and a toothpick. It is only a minor upgrade, the system should be back up in a few hours. I think we can plug just one more thing in to this outlet strip without tripping the breaker. What is all this I hear about static charges destroying computers. I found this rabbit program that is supposed to test system performance and I have it running now.</td>

 Been a long six weeks, with two major shutdowns going on, but I'm not complaining. I'm really liking this new endeavor, there is so much to it that you never get bored. One thing I don't like about it is we have a weekly call rotation, of which I finally become a part of this Monday. I guess I'm kinda nervous about it, now that I have to go solo at night. I hope I don't have a bad week this week, but only time will tell.</td>

 I think he adopted her, but that be as it may, doesn't matter. I have gone back to my files to see if maybe it was my fault, but in my files they are listed correctly. Another thing that I see is the Grave Marker of Joseph Early Little that is on the same page as Salina's Grave Marker. I talked with my Uncle Eugene Williams whose Mom was my grandmother, Georgia Lela Little and the names from her side of the family got him talking and remembering some tid bits that I am putting together. I know we are cousins in some way, I will try in my spare time to really take a better look at the lines in your book.</td>
