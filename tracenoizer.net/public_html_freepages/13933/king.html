Colonial and Revolutionary Lineages of America (973 D2ah) Vol. Macbeth seized the Scottish throne by killing Duncan I in battle, but was himself defeated and killed by Duncan's son, who reigned as MALCOLM III. He was of royal blood and one of the generals of King Duncan, whom he murdered to take the throne. He probably was a leader of the Irish (Gaelic) party, rather than of the Anglicizing group to which the royal family belonged. He was killed and succeeded by Malcolm III Canmore.</td>

 The herring shoal was a far cry the day the old man saw the mermaid, but she was in the very spot where later the herring boat sank to the bottom and the drowning occurred. I remember the old man very well with his white moustache, slightly kippered by the smoke of the peat fire. Regarded to be one of the same ancestry as Magnus Magnuson, he was possibly a descendant of a once-upon-a-time King of the Hebrides. He was always bent forward, as a result of the steep climb he had from the boat shore to his house and besides, there were no red carpets or polished decks for him. .</td>
