 Anyway, don't take my word for it, read some of the children's reviews about it. First of all we travelled by bus to the theatre, which took 1 hour. Macbeth and Banquo who were generals for King Duncan meet three weird sisters who are witches who say to Macbeth that he was going to be Thane of Cawdaw, then king. Soon afterwards, Macbeth was made Thane of Cawdaw, which leads him to believe he was going to be king. Macbeth killed Duncan and was discovered by Macduff.</td>

 (MacBeth) Birnham wood is growing My world comes crashing down None of woman born will take me. . Hand in hand (MacBeth) This night together we commit this bloody deed No one will suspect us in doing such a thing We'll place the blame on the servant we shall kill. Banquo; our trusted friend Suspects our plot to be rulers of this land Banquo you're life will be rid of this world I shall not regret. (MacBeth) I must seek the sisters to guide me in my plight There must be more.</td>
