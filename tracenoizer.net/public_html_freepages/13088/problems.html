 If possible, the submissions should be made in Tex (or Latex) with Postscript figures (if any). .edu Problems in Low-Dimensional Topology (a 380 pages PostScript file) edited by Rob Kirby contain some problems on Topological Dynamics. A problem by John Milnor We are soliciting open problems in various areas of Dynamical Systems for posting on this page. The problems will be posted with author's name and the date of submission.</td>

 No attempt is made to search for the most elegant answer. I highly recommend that you at least try to solve the problem before you read the solution. Problems about Matrices, Determinants, Systems of linear equations Level 2 problems A and B are n x n matrices. Assume that m satisfies this condition and consider the system with A as coefficient matrix. So, we consider the first and the second equation as main equations and the system has a solution for y and z if and only if the characteristic determinant of the third equation is 0.</td>
