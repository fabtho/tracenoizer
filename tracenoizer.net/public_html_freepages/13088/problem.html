 You can probably work around it by making sure that the viewcolor you set is present in the system palette. . Does the problem go away if the monitor is set to 8 bit. What's probably happening is that you're setting the view color to an rgb color that isn't present in the system palette and the text control is using the nearest indexed color for some of its drawing. You can probably work around it by making sure that the viewcolor you set is present in the system palette.</td>

 . No attempt is made to search for the most elegant answer. I highly recommend that you at least try to solve the problem before you read the solution. Problems about Matrices, Determinants, Systems of linear equations Level 2 problems A and B are n x n matrices. Assume that m satisfies this condition and consider the system with A as coefficient matrix.</td>

 Favorite Internet Sites Math GoodiesThis math site includes lessons, puzzles and worksheets, homework, and message boards. Math SurfThis is a site that provides numerous math problems and magazine type resources. MathlinksThis is an interactive site for students who need remedial and challenged work on math problem solving. LessonPlans Exploring the National Math Trail Math Magic Problem Solving Challenges The Problem Solving Stowaway Adventure Using the Internet The Internet is a great source of information which my class will utilize in my classroom and the KES computer lab on a daily basis. I will subscribe to online databases for additional resources for student access for intended projects.</td>
