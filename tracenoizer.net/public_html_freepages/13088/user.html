 . I plan to implement a knowledge kernel and an optimization kernel and database management. This system would manage the large number of technical details required by the user for specific applications. A specific use for this framework would be a Computer Aided Surgical Planning System. Such a system would allow a surgeon to plan and analyze a procedure on a patient-specific model with limited knowledge of the model generation, model discretization, and finite element solution process.</td>

 Many such calculations take a significant time to set up and can run for minutes, hours or even days on the most powerful computers. Various versions of REDUCE have been in use for over twenty years. There has been a steady stream of improvements and refinements since then, with the source being subject to wide review by the user community. REDUCE has thus evolved into a powerful system whose critical components are highly reliable, stable and efficient. A particular algebra system is often chosen for a given calculation because of its widespread use in a particular application area, with existing packages and templates being used to speed up problem solving.</td>
