 In the Zeiss camera system, this principle is achieved using a mirror with a central hole. The mirror reflects a circle of light through the pupil while the fundus is viewed through the central mirror hole. A properly designed fundus camera collects all the unwanted reflected light and focuses it to a point that acts as a light trap (highly absorbing material) located on the front lens. Light from an incandescent lamp and also from a flashlamp are folded into a common path, striking the holed mirror and reflecting the light into the eye. Light reflected from the retina comes through the hole in the mirror and focuses a real image in the film plane of the fundus camera.</td>
