<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" Recently he wrote an excellent guide to over 40 'great escape' runs, in both the North and South Island, exploring endless terrains of open country, spectacular coastlines and hidden roads of promise. Lance has had years of experience in this field, but is also very mechanically minded and can help Paul keeping the motorcycles in perfect order. When he's high on paint fumes, Lance enjoys giving friendly service to the customers, filling their every need. In Lance's spare time, you'll find him cruising on his GoldWing GL1500 and eagerly awaiting the arrival of our GL1800. He makes sure it gives the viewers everything they need to know in a visually pleasing layout because the website is where most of our customers come from.">
