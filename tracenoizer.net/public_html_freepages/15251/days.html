 We've been in business since 1988, carrying a full line of radio-controlled products from over 300 manufacturers. Uses a simulated servo load for precise, accurate readings. You can return anything purchased from OmniModels within 30 days as long as it is new and unused - and we will NOT charge you a restocking fee. Our policies are simple, fair and above all, put the customer first. All prices, pictures and descriptions subject to change.</td>

 We will gladly include a free personalized gift card with any order (whether or not you elect to have the items gift wrapped). Simply let us know what you wish to say in the "gift message" box and we will enclose a hand-written gift card. Transit time within the USA for standard "ground" service will add one to six business days; you should expect your order within about nine business days. Q) Why do I have to pay sales tax on my order to California. A) We must charge sales tax on orders shipping to destinations within California, because we are located in that state.</td>
