 Competition for procurement of personal services is provided within the law. State agencies have authority to conduct their own purchases for personal services, so such purchasing is done in a decentralized manner in Washington. This review also results in a central location of personal service contract information for ease of public review. Client Service Contracts OFM is responsible for issuing contract guidelines for client service contracts, but agencies procure and award their own client service contracts. These individuals may require government assistance to meet those needs.</td>
