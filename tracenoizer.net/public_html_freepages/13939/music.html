 You can bet that music plays significantly in this vision. . Pete Contact Us Pete was exposed to music at a very early age, beginning with classical piano lessons at the age of 5. For the next 14 years, he would become quite comfortable with many of the classical standards, even having the opportunity to perform in several annual piano recitals. While taking lessons and learning the discipline associated with daily practice presented a challenge for Pete, his opportunity to play for his church's local congregation changed how he viewed music in general.</td>
