 . We acknowledge that the opportunity to compete for "initiative" funding has induced some campus units to reflect differently on unmet needs and future possibilities, and that this new thought has been good for the campus as a whole.

We regret to report that, as presently implemented, the Initiatives Process has taken the place of rational campus planning, and threatens to become its very antithesis. CPB has long believed that a limited portion of the campus budget should be set aside for meritorious and innovative projects that may fall outside the immediate priorities and plans of the powers that be.</td>

 The so-called final SOLEC98 version of the indicators list should be distributed in the spring of 1999. . The Process - Future Slide 26 of 30 We will widely distribute the proposed Indicators List for review and encourage suggestions through the winter months of 1999. Comments and suggestions will be forwarded to the Core Groups for their consideration, and additional changes to the indicators will be made as appropriate. At this point, the proposed indicators will be presented for approval by the governments of Canada and the United States through the Binational Executive Committee.</td>
