 Creation of futures is necessary for some uses of multiple-value-call. . A natural way to accommodate this problem is by modifying the implementation of futures so that one future object returns (or resolves to) multiple values instead of one. We first show how a such straightforward modification fails to maintain the crucial characteristic of futures, namely that inserting futures in a functional program does not alter the the result of the computation. A straightforward modification may result in wrong number of values.</td>

 The so-called final SOLEC98 version of the indicators list should be distributed in the spring of 1999. . The Process - Future Slide 26 of 30 We will widely distribute the proposed Indicators List for review and encourage suggestions through the winter months of 1999. Comments and suggestions will be forwarded to the Core Groups for their consideration, and additional changes to the indicators will be made as appropriate. At this point, the proposed indicators will be presented for approval by the governments of Canada and the United States through the Binational Executive Committee.</td>

 There are implications for monitoring programs, and we should all seek opportunities for collaboration among our Great Lakes organizations to adjust our monitoring programs to support the indicators. . The Process - Future Slide 27 of 30 Although we will bring closure to the SOLEC98 Indicators List, we anticipate that there will be continuing evaluation of the indicators, development of new ones, and research to better understand the Great Lakes ecosystem. Also, the creation of a SOLEC Indicators list will be an empty exercise if no efforts are made to collect the attending data. There are implications for monitoring programs, and we should all seek opportunities for collaboration among our Great Lakes organizations to adjust our monitoring programs to support the indicators.</td>
