 I would say this was the beginning of an unfinished expansion of what we consider world-systems research. I believe we need to, thoughtfully, re-take that approach. Any subject in sociology, I suppose, can be approached from a world- system methodology and perspective. However WS work grew in the area of development and third world poverty. Why doesn't PEWS expand its purview to include development in its title.</td>

 Product testing, certification, laboratory accreditation, and labeling procedures impact product cost and quality. Government mandated conformity assessment requirements also represent opportunities for trade protection. Finally, there are important development aspects of trade liberalization and standards which relate to the rights and obligations undertaken in the multilateral trading system. There are specific development challenges which need to be explored associated with integration into the world trade system, for example. Development Challenges and Opportunities in Central America This regional seminar seeks to expand understanding of the specific development aspects of standards and technical regulations among six Central American countries2, and Dominican Republic, as they relate to trade.</td>

 But if it is, it seems to me that it is because PEWS has finished the first stage of growth of a new paradigm, and now needs to move on. It set itself up in clear opposition to Modernization and Dependency theories, and pursued a program of reconstructing our understanding of history from the new perspective. In this period, it was necessarily self-absorbed, and the title "Political Economy of the World-System" was reflective of that narcissism. Now, however, the initial phase of narrow self-definition is past. Research has exploded into a myriad of specific areas scattered across disciplines.</td>
