 Hons in Mechanical Engineering and MBA both from the University of Newcastle Upon Tyne. An engineer by profession, I am currently the Operations Manager of a first generation Magnox nuclear power station in SW Scotland. Formerly, I was Works and Engineering Manager of a small manufacturing engineering company in Carlisle and I spent several years as a seagoing marine engineer. Additional to my normal duties, I have a special interest in the training, motivation and development of people. The prime focus of the research is to explore the apparent contradiction of objectives of downsizing an organisation whilst simultaneously developing OC and to evaluate the contribution, or otherwise, to the positive development of OC by the application of a corporate culture of supportiveness in a downsizing climate.</td>
