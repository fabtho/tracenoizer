<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" Photonics Materials Ltd, a Scottish start-up company and the brainchild of Strathclyde University graduate Dr John Nicholls, is set to be a key player in the optoelectronics revolution as the only domestic producer of specialist optoelectronic crystals, and one of only a handful in the world. John Nicholls' comprehensive knowledge of this specialist industry was acquired in the course of his university work. While working toward his PhD at Strathclyde, he won a special fellowship to the Centre for Research and Education in Optics and Lasers in Florida. He later returned to Florida to pursue further work on new crystals, leading to a patent on a new crystal process for use in optoelectronics, and joined a spinout from the Centre as Research and Development Director. Seeing the existing crystal producers did not adequately service the European market, Dr Nicholls was convinced that the situation presented a significant commercial opportunity.">
