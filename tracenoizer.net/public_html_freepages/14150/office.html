 He spent a lot of his life working for groups that helped Aboriginal people, including the National Aboriginal Sports Foundation and the Aborigines' League of Advancement in Victoria. He was awarded two medals by Queen Elizabeth II and was made Sir Douglas Nicholls in 1972 because of his work for Aboriginal Australians. He had only held office for a few months when he became too sick to work. A suburb in Canberra and a sports field in Melbourne are named after him. More information on Doug Nicholls is included on the Stories of Democracy CD-ROM.</td>
