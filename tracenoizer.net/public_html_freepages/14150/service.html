 About NAG - Company Development Company Development Until mid-1975, the distribution of the NAG Library was, for funding reasons, restricted to UK university computing sites and certain related installations. Since the Library and its supporting facilities appeared to be useful to scientific computer users generally, it was decided to make the Library more widely available. A Library Service based on Mark 5 was initiated in 1976. To facilitate the provision of such a service, NAG became a not-for-profit company, limited by guarantee, in March 1976. This particular company structure was chosen to reflect NAG's continuing commitment to collaborative work in the development of software for the benefit of the scientific and research community.</td>
