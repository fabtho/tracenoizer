 Since 1988 a number of distributors have been appointed in Europe, Asia, Australasia and South Africa, and the continuing development of the distributor network is an important strand in NAG marketing and sales strategy. . About NAG - Company Development Company Development Until mid-1975, the distribution of the NAG Library was, for funding reasons, restricted to UK university computing sites and certain related installations. Since the Library and its supporting facilities appeared to be useful to scientific computer users generally, it was decided to make the Library more widely available. A Library Service based on Mark 5 was initiated in 1976.</td>
