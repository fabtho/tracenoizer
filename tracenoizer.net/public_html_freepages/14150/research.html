 The office responds promptly to requests for data and initiates studies to improve university governance and management. . The Director of Assessment and Institutional Research serves as a member of the University Cabinet, Planning Advisory Committee, Enrollment Planning Committee, and Research Council. This exposure ensures that the research function serves the specific needs of the University as related to program reviews, policy reviews, and appraisal of purpose. The Office of Assessment and Institutional Research gathers data and transforms these data into information that is then disseminated to University administrators, facilitating academic analysis and decision making.</td>
