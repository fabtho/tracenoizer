 This is the first revision of the Benchmarks since they were introduced in 1991. The current printed and cd-rom versions of the Michigan Curriculum Framework do not contain the updated Science Benchmarks. It contains ideas and resources for improving curriculum, teaching, assessment and professional development. The New Directions Science Teaching Units are inquiry-based instructional materials developed to promote deep understanding of the Science Benchmarks. Several of these units have been acclaimed by the American Association for the Advancement of Science Project 2061 as the best available resources for promoting science literacy.</td>
