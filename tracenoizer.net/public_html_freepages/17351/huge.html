 They consist of young individuals record companies select at the teenage talent shows. They don't write their music, they are told how to dress, how to talk, and what to sing by the record execs. For example, when Brittney Spears first entered showbiz she wanted to be a guitar rocker, being the huge fan of Sheryl Crow, only without any talent. The record company told her that she better sing what they tell her to sing, or they won't make her a star. .</td>
