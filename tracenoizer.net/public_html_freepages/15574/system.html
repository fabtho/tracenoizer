 Most retry schemes significantly increase the variability of delay. . The principle, called the end-to-end argument, suggests that functions placed at low levels of a system may be redundant or of little value when compared with the cost of providing them at that low level. Low level mechanisms to support these functions are justified only as performance enhancements. Design principles that provide guidance in this choice of function placement are among the most important tools of a system designer.</td>
