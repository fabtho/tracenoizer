 This module shows you how to analyze your research assignment to find the requirements of the assignment and how the requirements influence your library research. This step is particularly important if you are using information found on the World Wide Web. This module provides hints on how to analyze information sources. This reference list (works cited or bibliography) will allow people who read your research assignment to trace the information you present back to its original source. This module provides examples of how to cite sources in MLA, APA, and Turabian styles.</td>

 On the left you'll list which questions you want to answer, and on the right you'll list the steps you plan to take in order to obtain the answers. Once you've decided which question you want to focus on, you're ready to move on to Step 3. Before you can fill out the rest of your research plan, you'll need to figure out which information sources are likely to be best for answering your question. If you're just beginning with genealogy, you'll need to understand the different kinds of information sources that can be used for genealogical research. Primary sources are sources that were created at or near the time of an event, usually by someone who was a direct observer or participant in the event.</td>

 It is very useful to formulate your topic as a question you are trying to answer. Does the current welfare system create a cycle of poverty. Remember that if too many people are working on the same topic area, the first person to the library will get the best sources. Search Words Before you start a subject or keyword search on any of the on-line databases, you should work up a list of terms that may be relevant to your particular research project. The wrong keyword (or a misspelled one) can frustrate any project.</td>
