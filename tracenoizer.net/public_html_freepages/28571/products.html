 Company Profile Since its early beginnings the computer industry has been dominated by people for whom computing is both a necessity and a passion. , we try to alleviate the negatives of buying through mail order or through the big chain stores where service is a word only applied to one of the elevators. In order to fulfill our commitment to total service we have a sales, service, and support staff with an excess of 100 years of experience and we hold a huge inventory of products and spare parts. We offer low, low price maintenance contracts that call for a four (4) hour response time during the work week. Our present location is in the center of the San Fernando Valley which allows us to travel to service the Los Angeles area in a timely manner and with the minimum of travel delays.</td>
