 When it comes to automation, some companies are natural born leaders. Company Profile Since its early beginnings the computer industry has been dominated by people for whom computing is both a necessity and a passion. , we try to alleviate the negatives of buying through mail order or through the big chain stores where service is a word only applied to one of the elevators. In order to fulfill our commitment to total service we have a sales, service, and support staff with an excess of 100 years of experience and we hold a huge inventory of products and spare parts. We offer low, low price maintenance contracts that call for a four (4) hour response time during the work week.</td>
