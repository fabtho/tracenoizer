<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" He is a very good French player who was poorly last season. I fink it was a freaky year for them and they will be better this time especially as Lollipop Dayglo has got better. Smudger is in charge from the start so they will be playing total Smudgerby every week. We still have our good players and have got some more and some have even come back like Johnny Slightgnome. I fink the Saints will win fings this season, big fings.">

 We expect participation on all levels, including checking the webpage for news or messgaes. If you use any proggies, bots or cheats you will be flamed and kicked so far off this planet you'll need a space shuttle to get back. You must show respect for all other players (unless they're real ass wipes) while playing. Members are welcome to recruit new talent as long as they go through the proper motions. All applicants must fill out the recruitment application and try out with the leaders before being accepted.</td>
