 As far as I am concerned I have configured it correctly. I am just curious as to which key you depress to talk. I cannot imagine it is voice activated as there are no controls to adjust mic sensitivity. If someone knows how to work the in-voice then that would be cool. Or is it a case of they put it in but the developers themselves havent a clue how to use it.</td>
