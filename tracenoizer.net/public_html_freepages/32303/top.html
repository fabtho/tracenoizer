 Well, inevitably college costs enter the discussion. (Believe me, Connor is just 5 months old and it's a hot topic. Four top NY agents visit Kathy Wickline Casting to meet the actors (that are pre-qualified) and ready to expand to the NY market.

 I have at the back of my mind that Mark Welland may have done more, but can you confirm. b) 4 I think by both 554 Chalkie Douglas and 68 Wayne Holton in A60s at Arena. Holton would've gone further were it not for the fact that he ended up perched on top of the armco before falling back trackside. Reports in Grid of 5 and a half rolls can't be substantiated as reporters had a tendency to exagerrate back in the 1970s. Henham had 36 at one meeting in the early 80's, that was followed by 32 the next week at Braintree so I kind of overdosed.</td>
