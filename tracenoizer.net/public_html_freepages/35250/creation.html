<meta name="Description" lang=" "content=" And timber deliveries to Kondopoga could not guarantee stability either, as the lespromkhoz is situated on the border of the area of economically justified transportation for this enterprise. Thus, even if demands of the nature protection organizations are ignored, it's impossible to solve problems of the lespromkhoz. The only way out of this situation is starting their own processing of logged timber (this will allow to do with small volumes of logging) and creation in Piaozersky village of enterprises, not dependent on logging activities (for example, related to fishing or tourism). Manifold economy of the village (inhabited by about 5 thousand settlers) and its independence from one, actually temporary, enterprise is the only key to its stable development in future. If the management is wisely organized, the village development and protection of unique taiga massif can be combined, if it's unwise (like what we observe now) - neither this nor that is possible.">
