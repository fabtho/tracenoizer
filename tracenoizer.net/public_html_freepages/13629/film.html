 "When I make records and add dialogue, they become cinematic," Holmes notes. . This might give a timorous film producer seeking to hire someone to score their own movie a moments pause. " "The goal was to be Vegas but not obviously Vegas," explains the Belfast-born Holmes, in Los Angeles for his film's premiere, adding that he turned down no fewer than 60 film-scoring jobs after Out of Sight. He's signed on to do Confessions of a Dangerous Mind next, making three of his five movie jobs George Clooney vehicles (his music is the equivalent of Clooney's self-assured swagger).</td>

 Memories of recording the links for Therapy's "Infernal Love". Dexys Midnight Runners at the Ulster Hall, Belfast. I always wanted to avoid sampling films for my records, that's why I decided to make our own film, or not yet as the case is. But the film script now has a lot of interest and might yet get made. With a mix of Ry Cooder, Jack Nietzche, The Rolling Stones and The Last Poets you'd think it would be a mess but their shared vision gets them through.</td>

 The album manages an infectious blend of uptown euphoria and downtown hysteria. com Early in Out of Sight, Steven Soderbergh's take on Elmore Leonard's novel, charming ex-con Jack Foley (George Clooney) lies in a car trunk with lovely federal marshal Karen Cisco (Jennifer Lopez). com When Danny DeVito commissioned Irish producer David Holmes to provide the score for the film Out of Sight, he chose wisely. Holmes's gritty, urban dance music, first exposed on the sadly underrated The Film's Crap Let's Slash. Repetition wouldn't be so bad if these looped beats were better -- more danceable perhaps.</td>

 British born Holmes has certainly had a diverse and eclectic career. Starting as a DJ working the English and Irish club circuit, his earliest success was with the dance floor hit 'DeNiro', based on a sampling of Ennio Morricone's theme from Once Upon A Time In America. Songs from his first solo album 'The Film's Crap, Let's Slash The Seats' featured in a number of film soundtracks and trailers. This, together with his second album, led Holmes to work with Soderbergh on Out Of Sight. As colourful and vibrant as a walk down the Vegas Strip itself, Holmes' visceral score fits the film like a glove.</td>
