 He's no stranger to films with all his albums so far having a cinematic feel. . David Holmes' album, 'Bow Down To The Exit Sign', is being made into a movie. That was always the concept behind the album, but now David's seeing the production take shape. We've actually got two major producers on board now and a possible director or two and lots of un-actor type people.</td>
