 He's no stranger to films with all his albums so far having a cinematic feel. . David Holmes' album, 'Bow Down To The Exit Sign', is being made into a movie. That was always the concept behind the album, but now David's seeing the production take shape. We've actually got two major producers on board now and a possible director or two and lots of un-actor type people.</td>

 The album'Bow down to the Exit Sign' is released on July 31st on Go. . Beat RealAudio Stream - 28K Not what you'd call a commercial record by any stretch of the imagination but in David Holmes' mind it'd the most commercial track on his forthcoming album 'Bow Down to The Exit Sign'. It's probably his one concession to his record company on an the album that was supposed to make him a DJ superstar. It won't find it's way onto the floor at Aiya Napa or Ibeezer but it is an album that you'll still be listening to in five years.</td>
