It's an arena that synthesizes technological and algorithmic advances at an astonishing rate. Critical to my thinking is that what I do is perceived as art, and not that I have made an art out of writing computer games. The later sentiment positions the work as something "other" when I fully intend it to be the thing itself, whatever that thing called art may be. I don't really want to start throwing up fences, but on the other side are artists who use the computer to simply engage in the current art dialogue.">

 During lab hours students will have hands-on practice with multimedia tools. Reciprocal exchange between the viewer and artwork, the ability to manipulate media and objects intuitively and with immediacy. The evolution of the technical, aesthetic, and cognitive concepts behind human-computer interactions, and their influence on the design and application of integrated media. Beginning with the fundamentals of cybernetics as conceived by engineer Norbert Wiener in the late 1940s, we will discuss subsequent scientific breakthroughs in human-computer interaction. The non-sequential linking of information, events, and discrete media.</td>
