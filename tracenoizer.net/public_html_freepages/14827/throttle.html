 Connectivity is provided by a single USB cable about three feet long. Beneath the base are four suction cups to keep the joystick from moving. Unfortunately, the throttle on the F-108 is placed inconveniently; using it with a second hand when its cramped so close to the stick is uncomfortable after periods of time; furthermore, it makes it difficult to switch between the keyboard and the throttle wheel. Placing the throttle wheel on the column itself so it could be operated by the right hand would have left the left hand free for keyboard or mouse manipulation. The throttle has too much tension for its size; altering it is unnaturally tedious.</td>

 . Evinrude Outboards - John's Marine Portable Four StrokesEasy Starting, Smooth Performance From 5 hp to 15 hp, when it comes to quality and performance, it's hard to beat an Evinrude portable. A friction adjustment lets you customize the throttle feel and effort. A quick release trim pin lets you change trim positions quickly and easily. Plus this prop has a fish line cutter which traps and cuts stray fish line to prevent damage to the gearcase seals.</td>
