 The subject of this discussion is the Roundel's universally admired 3 Series and the story's the same for that model of car as it is for any other. Give us the soon-to-be-available 330i (or better yet the M3) and we'll be in automotive utopia. But before drowning in a sea of always desiring more go-to-jail power, we'll first sing the praises of this sexy drop top. And many of those glories have nothing to do with its relative lack of power compared to its bigger-brother 3 Series coupes, sedans, and ragtops. As is the case with most BMWs, how good the car feels in your hands as well as overall handling dynamics remain an area where these cars shine.</td>
