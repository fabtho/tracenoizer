 The Integrated Global Ocean Services System (IGOSS) is the international SYSTEM for the collection and exchange of ocean data (such as temperature and salinity) and the preparation and dissemination of oceanic products and services. IGOSS is coordinated jointly by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), and consists of national facilities and services provided by participating member countries who share data for mutual benefit. In the IOS, naval ships, research vessels, and merchant ships in the Ships-of-Opportunity Programme (SOOP) along with fixed and floating buoys transmit oceanographic data such as subsurface temperature and salinity in near-real time. The IDPSS consists of several types of national, specialized and world data centres for processing and dissemination data and data products. The backbone of the ITA is the Global Telecommunication System (GTS) of the WMO.</td>
