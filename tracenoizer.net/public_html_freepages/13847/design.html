 The front desk and I came to an arrangement that involved only the occasional emergency patient from then on. So, what's changed during the 15 years I've been away. I bet the manufacturers also love the new delivery design. What was once contained in a little box in an operatory drawer has become its own entire tray of shade-categorized syringes, gels, brushes and that oh so groovy UV light gun. Is this stuff really that much improved over the self-setting Concise.</td>

 In accordance with section 9 of the Act, the North Lakeside Project Committee (the Project Committee) was established to provide advice, technical analysis (based on mandate responsibilities), and recommendations on the Application. Summary of Issues The following summarizes the issues identified and addressed during the review of the Project. The Project Committee required further information on the periodic discharge of well water to Williams Lake during start-up and shut-down, including clarification of the general design of the discharge system, installation of the discharge pipe, and expected frequency of discharge. The proponent provided clarification that the discharge will be to a rip-rap lined ditch, with rip-rap erosion protection extending 2-3 m into the lake. The use of a ditch with appropriate erosion protection for the intermittent water discharge was found to be acceptable, and the use of rip-rap has the potential to improve the food production capacity of the habitat.</td>
