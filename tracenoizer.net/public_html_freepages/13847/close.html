Between aging rock and roll scenesters and embraced societal misfits, my own patient list was sufficiently lengthy.">

 People used to travel a lot to find better jobs, they moved to other places, soldiers went to army to the other corners of Slovakia, young people were getting married . and each of these would bring something new to the other place which became domesticated there. The regions situated close to the border with other countries were influenced by their immediate surroundings of other nations. Eastern Slovakia was influenced by Russian culture, Western Slovakia by Czech folklore, more precisely - Moravian. So that you could imagine it better, here is the map of Slovakia where the folk regions are marked.</td>
