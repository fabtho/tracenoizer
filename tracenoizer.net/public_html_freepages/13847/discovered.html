 The settlements from Parta (Timis country) distinguishes itself from the other similar sites. The archeological excavations unearthed here on of the largest Neolithic settlements from Banat (south-western Romania). Among the buildings discovered, a structure made of twigs and clay detaches as worshipping place. One at the chambers sheltered the altar and the other was the place where the offerings ware presented. In the altar room there was a clay supporting a double, two headed statue.</td>

 Rosy Pannaci went with the crowd pleasing Macy Gray but later redeemed herself with the sweet sounds of Morcheeba. Both the George Brown College student show and the Smirnoff Fashion Awards, where you might expect some decent beats, included French artists such as Air and Dimitri on the play list. Findlay have a subtle touch that can only truly be discovered if you actually listen to the rest of Vertigo. Try finding their first full length, Northern Star on the Tummy Touch label, or their most recent effort, a perfectly paced compilation. This features the soulful swagger of Al Green, Barry White, the deep house of Tall Stories and the clincher for your show, a Tim Love Lee remix where the applause is already taken.</td>

 Implants were not around when I was practicing, at least not so ubiquitously to the general public. I saw a patient who was missing a lower lateral and canine, between two bridges, and it was suggested that with a bone graft to augment a too-narrow osseous ridge, implants would be feasible. The dental operatory at some time must have been discovered to be a toxic time bomb, putting entire strip malls at risk. Pathologic microbes must have now evolved into indefensible little monsters. Should I feel blessed to have survived even my paltry six years as a practicing dentist.</td>
