They are also aware of the many different types of facilities which the internet offers however it is clear from our findings at this initial stage that students from both sets of academic backgrounds believe they were not offered enough relevant training and that many have developed what skills they do have through a lengthy process of trial and error. The students came from various degree courses (listed in chart) and this helped give a set of balanced opinions to the questions which were posed. From the Ten students, Nine had previously used the internet and only One had not (this was the French degree student).</td>
