 Pic from ShaftedLAN, Melbourne Victoria, Australia. As a result, the LANParty submission system is receiving an error entitled "500 Internal Server Error". Unfortunately, it just means the server isn't correctly processing the data and that the data that was submitted was junked. Please note, this does NOT affect the display of the LANParty database data, it simply prohibits further updates by the community or the staff here at LANParty. The tech-ninjas at GameSpy Industries HQ are working on the situation and hope to have the situation resolved soon.</td>
