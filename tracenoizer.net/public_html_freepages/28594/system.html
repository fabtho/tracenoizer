This paper demonstrates techniques that automatically extract such checking information from the source code itself, rather than the programmer, thereby avoiding the need for a priori knowledge of system rules.

 OET's Educational Services staff works with the state's educational technology centers each year to determine which programs are in demand. OET then negotiates a group lease for the program rights, at a significantly reduced cost. OET records the programs, then distributes them to the stations for broadcast over the state's fiber optic interconnection system. The ITV programs are designed for k-12 classrooms in all areas of study. Among the new programs offered this season is Club Write, designed for grades 4-6, this 14-part series supports writing skills on many different levels, from lyrics to persuasion and technical reports.</td>
