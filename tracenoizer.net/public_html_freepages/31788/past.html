 While no one of the performers in this ensemble piece could be called the star, Anita Cerquetti comes closest. Schroeter tries to delve into the mysteries of the voice, but interrupts the quest by consistently cutting to images of the ancient, worn walls of the abbey and to the world outside, counterpointing a musical motif with a pink dawn sky or a barge moving slowly upriver. Eventually she's singing along with it, her lined face suffused with emotion as she makes a visible connection with her own past. On the other hand, she shows a deep understanding of the dangerous power of the music and her gift to express it. While the singers were told to choose their favorite aria and costumes, surely Schroeter could have intervened when Laurence Dane arrived in pancake makeup and began to shriek his selection.</td>
