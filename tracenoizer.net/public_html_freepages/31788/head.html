 While the singers were told to choose their favorite aria and costumes, surely Schroeter could have intervened when Laurence Dane arrived in pancake makeup and began to shriek his selection. Some fans have also objected to the fact that the director painfully reprises some of Dane's failed high notes, rubbing his (and our) nose in an obvious musical mistake. It doesn't help that he then kneels before her and sticks his head in her lap. Most curious, though, is the sequence with sexy Sergei Larin, who discusses romantic poetry with an unidentified Italian twink. Larin is married with children, but this scene has led some to believe Love's Debris is his coming-out.</td>

 Prior to coming to the Harman Library, Naomi worked at the Hebrew University's Library of Mathematics and Computer Science as well as in the Acquisitions Department of the National Library. Naomi joined the staff of the Harman Library in 1997. She gained valuable work experience in several of the Library's departments, before being nominated as Head of the Reference Section, a position she filled from 1999 until her recent appointment as Director. From the new Library Director As I assume the challenging task of heading the Library, I would like to take this occasion to greet our Newsletter readers and outline some of the Library's goals. Our aim is to provide the environment and atmosphere that will be conducive to continued progress in all academic, professional and technological aspects of library services.</td>
