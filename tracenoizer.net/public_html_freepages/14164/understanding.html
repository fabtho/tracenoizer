 From play to work, our lives have been filled with new gadgets and shaped by new understandings. Research is so profound in its implications for life and thought that it cannot be left to scientists alone. Science and technology must enter into the heart of general discourse and understanding. Research agendas can determine the flow of the future. For example, researchers working on ideas such as ubiquitous computing (making objects intelligent and aware of their surroundings) are working on more than just new products.</td>

 com on which to flog reproductions of famous art pieces. It's not like there aren't already loads of sites doing just that, but thankfully some online art sites are going much further and using the actual medium itself to create new forms of art or offer new ways of looking at traditional art. com which attempts to put the appreciation of art into a wider context with the use of features like 'keywords' that use the associative qualities of the internet to create new forms of art, experience and understanding. Marc Lafia, the site's editorial and creative director, describes these as 'representing basic categories of thought, emotion or value. You follow them to look for new disciplines that share qualities with those you already like, or to open up new worlds of arts and culture.</td>

 The electronic eye of the camera has thus turned into our sensitive apparatus, a sense, affecting our perception and cognition establishing through motion patterns specific space construct(ions) from physiological to psychic and emotional ones. Film analogies are relevant to the discourse of 20th century architecture since the cinema was the first media to introduce temporal and spatial discontinuity. For example the frame by frame montage inscribing dynamics and tension through static or categoric motion has been the base of the constructivist understanding of space describing the latter out of borrows and arrows as a balance of weight and movement which even includes states of mind being translated into visual displays. Architects like Bernhard Tschumi for example have transposed the filmic discontinuous space-time construct of montage to the architecture of the 'parc de la villette' where the overlaying of different programmatic, geometric and functional elements are used to generate a system of inter-connected elements, thus building up a complexity of meaning. In his writings and works about de-construction Bernard Tschumi often refers to Sergei Eisenstein's technique of 'dialectic montage' in the construct of e-motional space as a subjective cutting of multiple 'narrative' elements interconnecting and representing different layers of stories, all parallel in time and space.</td>
