 . His work is an exploration of the narrative systems of books, films, photographs and network media, re-considering and re-presenting such systems as procedural machines of authoring and reading. From feature and experimental films to digital art, he explores how discourse constructs itself. His early films, 'auto-re-tour' and 'fini-la guerre', investigate the tensions between narrativity and the pure surface of film. As the machines of discourse move between signification systems and systems of rhythm, sound and image, they begin to oscillate between operations of chance and discrete narrativity, between signification and the slippage of signification.</td>
