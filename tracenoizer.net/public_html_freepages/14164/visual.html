com The Star-Spangled Banner Turbonium Viaduct Victoria and Albert Museum VW Auto Show 2000 Walrus Gear 2000 Online Catalog Williams-Sonoma www. Prior to its launch, online searches delivered too much information (a search for Pablo Picasso could list 20,000 results), not enough context and no way to determine relevancy. This comprehensive site for the visual and performing arts, design, literature, music and film interconnects all art-related subjects by using key words to make connections between artists and movements. In addition, it expands access to online arts and culture resources by using clearly-designed pages, clever navigation devices, publishing technology and a patent-pending user-interface. It uses a computational platform to put forward a perpetual curation in which all of the arts touch at surprising angles to each other, revealing varied contexts at different junctures.</td>

 Your answer is probably a collection of thoughts, ideas, and names that are difficult to link cohesively, but make perfect (and very subjective) sense to you. " Click on one and you could find yourself learning about filmmakers Joel and Ethan Coen. These "data clouds" serve as the site's compelling visual metaphor. "The unique art and culture engine," writes Marc Lafia, Artandculture. com's editorial and creative director, "is a machine which discovers accidents, creating art as it goes.</td>

 The electronic eye of the camera has thus turned into our sensitive apparatus, a sense, affecting our perception and cognition establishing through motion patterns specific space construct(ions) from physiological to psychic and emotional ones. Film analogies are relevant to the discourse of 20th century architecture since the cinema was the first media to introduce temporal and spatial discontinuity. For example the frame by frame montage inscribing dynamics and tension through static or categoric motion has been the base of the constructivist understanding of space describing the latter out of borrows and arrows as a balance of weight and movement which even includes states of mind being translated into visual displays. Architects like Bernhard Tschumi for example have transposed the filmic discontinuous space-time construct of montage to the architecture of the 'parc de la villette' where the overlaying of different programmatic, geometric and functional elements are used to generate a system of inter-connected elements, thus building up a complexity of meaning. In his writings and works about de-construction Bernard Tschumi often refers to Sergei Eisenstein's technique of 'dialectic montage' in the construct of e-motional space as a subjective cutting of multiple 'narrative' elements interconnecting and representing different layers of stories, all parallel in time and space.</td>
