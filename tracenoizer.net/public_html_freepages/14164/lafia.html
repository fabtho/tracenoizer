 In this post proximal world; who is speaking to you, who is giving you directives, who are you - and just whom might you be working for, who is the agent of whom. In this vast space of agency, identikits and remote operation, who operates whom. net Marc Lafia is an artist, filmmaker and information designer. Over the years Lafia has made various experimental films and conceptual art pieces exhibited in the U. His early films (Auto-re-tour, Fini-la-guerre) explore the tensions between narrative and the pure surface of film.</td>

 " Click on one and you could find yourself learning about filmmakers Joel and Ethan Coen. These "data clouds" serve as the site's compelling visual metaphor. "The unique art and culture engine," writes Marc Lafia, Artandculture. com's editorial and creative director, "is a machine which discovers accidents, creating art as it goes. " Indeed, the site beautifully exploits the associative properties of the Web as it allows us to track artistic styles and influences.</td>

 It's not like there aren't already loads of sites doing just that, but thankfully some online art sites are going much further and using the actual medium itself to create new forms of art or offer new ways of looking at traditional art. com which attempts to put the appreciation of art into a wider context with the use of features like 'keywords' that use the associative qualities of the internet to create new forms of art, experience and understanding. Marc Lafia, the site's editorial and creative director, describes these as 'representing basic categories of thought, emotion or value. You follow them to look for new disciplines that share qualities with those you already like, or to open up new worlds of arts and culture. ' So clicking on Jake and Dinos Chapman will give you good biographical information, recommended links and artists and keywords like 'cartoonish' , 'in your face' and 'mathematical'.</td>
