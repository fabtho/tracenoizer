 The ASUI office is located on the 3rd floor of the Idaho Commons in room 302. . Thirteen elected senators are assigned to living groups, including off-campus students, and colleges. These students, along with the ASUI President and Vice President, serve as student liaisons to University Administration. As the official voice of our student body, the ASUI creates policy to benefit our student population and manages student fees that support ASUI boards, student programs, and events.</td>

 Judith convenes a network of harassment contacts who are trained to support students and staff who feel they are receiving racial or sexual harassment, or other behaviour that contravenes the law or UKC equal opportuhnities policy, for example religious intolerance or bullying. She also convenes supporters for students who have suffered serious sexual assult or rape on campus. htm Back to top Financial Assistance Hopefully most students will not have financial problems whilst they are studying with us, but there are very real difficulties in living on a low income. The Students Union (see below) can provide help and advice on financial planning and money management, but if you do experience problems, there are some sources of financial help. All the basic organization of the Clinic is done by students, including the co-ordination of the evening Advice Sessions, the telephone reception and general running of the Clinic office and the chairing of the weekly Clinic meeting.</td>
