 Chest radiographs remain widely used, but the applications of computer technology in Radiology over the last two decades have led to new imaging techniques capable of demonstrating both fine detail of normal structures and subtle disease processes previously undetectable without invasive procedures such as surgery. The use of imaging techniques for the diagnosis of disease continues to increase rapidly, and familiarization with these investigations is valuable in virtually all areas of medical practice. Thoracic Radiology introduces first and second year medical students to various imaging modalities which may be used to identify and assess the anatomical structures within the thorax and to introduce the concept of living Anatomy by the use of real-time dynamic images. The purpose of this program is to demonstrate the various imaging modalities which may be used to identify and assess the anatomical structures within the thorax and to introduce the concept of living anatomy by the use of real-time dynamic images. Comparative digitized radiographic images and techniques, computer graphics, anatomical drawings, and textual information.</td>
