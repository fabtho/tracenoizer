 html UKC has a flourishing programme of music and, because there is no academic music department here, students of all subjects have the opportunity to get involved in the wide-range of extra-curricular music activities. html The University also has its own theatre, the Gulbenkian Theatre, situated close to the Templeman Library. It is part of the Unit for the Enhancement of Learning and Teaching (UELT), and is based near the banks. The entrance is between the Grimond Building and Barclays Bank. UELT is a development from what used to be known as Education Support Services (ESS), which came into being on 18 July 2001, and SLAS is an expansion of what used to be the Learning Resources Centre (LRC).</td>
