 Conceptual drawing of the DS1 ion propulsion system. also can generate tones, in a beacon monitor operations technology, that could prove a big help in reducing the large demand on NASA's deep space network. The spacecraft determines its own health and need for human assistance. It selects one of four tones indicating its diagnostic findings, transmitting the tone to Earth so that mission control can decide what, if any, action is needed. The other telecommunications technology to be tested is a Ka-band solid state power amplifier.</td>

 A hand appeared and wrote on the plaster of the lighted wall. The wall was covered with all sorts of lies, but now real truth was being recorded. Suddenly the fingers of a human hand wrote a message from heaven on the wall, and for the first time in the party there was silence. A very large wet blanket was put upon this great hall of celebration. In fact, they had never thought about an end to anything.</td>
