 . Conceptual drawing of the DS1 ion propulsion system. also can generate tones, in a beacon monitor operations technology, that could prove a big help in reducing the large demand on NASA's deep space network. The spacecraft determines its own health and need for human assistance. It selects one of four tones indicating its diagnostic findings, transmitting the tone to Earth so that mission control can decide what, if any, action is needed.</td>

 Owen From early use in detecting mineral deposits, this method has gone on to success in finding abandoned mines, sinkholes, and even military tunnels. . Nondestructive Testing of Aging Aircraft New technology improves detection of dangerous cracks in the nation's older commercial and military aircraft. Light Years Closer New nonlinear filtering technology can improve the accuracy of instruments used in space exploration, missile guidance and aircraft flight control systems. Navigating Virtual Worlds A new device enables operators to use real-world movements in simulated environments.</td>

 For the same payload size, SEP can shorten interplanetary cruise times and require fewer planetary swingby gravity assists than a chemical propulsion system. Solar Array Because of the ion propulsion system power requirements, DS1 needs a high-power solar array and this is another one of the technologies to be tested. It is known as SCARLET II, which stands for solar concentrator arrays with refractive linear element technology. This solar concentrator pair uses cylindrical lenses to concentrate sunlight onto a strip of photovoltaic cells. A relatively small solar array area is actually covered by solar cells.</td>
