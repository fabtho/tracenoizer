 The Science and Technology Centers are each focused on a range of research indicated by their titles. We attach lists of these various Sites, Laboratories, and Centers that will host groups of undergraduates. Each of the following institutions will take in a group of (usually) ten to fifteen undergraduates, who participate in the on-going research of the host department or laboratory. Unless otherwise noted, students are accepted from throughout the country. In addition, seminars, lunch meetings, and social functions will be organized to facilitate interaction between the undergraduates.</td>

 NASA managers are rewarded for mission success, not for taking risks. In the absence of a system that rewards risk, NASA needed to establish a method to demonstrate unvalidated technologies in deep space, thus reducing the associated risk. This led Goldin's associate administrator for space science, Wes Huntress, to spearhead the development of the New Millennium Program, managed for NASA at its Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). New Millennium was to be the final step in validating selected technologies so that they could be proposed for future missions without the stigma of risk. At JPL, the Deep Space One project manager is David Lehman and the management team includes Leslie Livesay, Phillip Varghese, and Curtis Cleven.</td>

 The target bodies are not what makes DS1 revolutionary, however. NASA has flown missions past comets and asteroids before. The color of the xenon gas rocket plume in the drawing reasonably approximates the true color of the plume as observed in laboratory test facilities. However, because these technologies have not been demonstrated in space they are perceived to have a fairly high risk to missions that use them for the first time. The program's solicitation of advanced technologies for space flight demonstration also stimulates their development and will strengthen the nation's technological infrastructure, making it more competitive in the global market.</td>
