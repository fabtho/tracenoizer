 And skyscrapers -- symbols of metropolitan prosperity -- create canyons that, depending on their geometry, trap solar energy and heat. Within the past decade, the population of San Antonio and its surrounding communities surpassed one million, making it the ninth-largest metropolitan area in the United States, and its growth continues. An increase in population with accompanying urban development carries good news and bad news. Development can be a boon to the economy of a city, but unfortunate environmental effects may result because of a loss of vegetative cover; an increase in the number of buildings, paved areas, and cars; and the generation of more waste heat. Rising temperatures in cities also affect demand-side power management of electric utilities.</td>

 NASA managers are rewarded for mission success, not for taking risks. In the absence of a system that rewards risk, NASA needed to establish a method to demonstrate unvalidated technologies in deep space, thus reducing the associated risk. This led Goldin's associate administrator for space science, Wes Huntress, to spearhead the development of the New Millennium Program, managed for NASA at its Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). New Millennium was to be the final step in validating selected technologies so that they could be proposed for future missions without the stigma of risk. At JPL, the Deep Space One project manager is David Lehman and the management team includes Leslie Livesay, Phillip Varghese, and Curtis Cleven.</td>

 The color of the xenon gas rocket plume in the drawing reasonably approximates the true color of the plume as observed in laboratory test facilities. However, because these technologies have not been demonstrated in space they are perceived to have a fairly high risk to missions that use them for the first time. The program's solicitation of advanced technologies for space flight demonstration also stimulates their development and will strengthen the nation's technological infrastructure, making it more competitive in the global market. Many of these technologies also will have commercial spinoffs that will benefit the public in its daily life. The innovations to be demonstrated on DS1 are among the foundation technologies expected to support the next generation of deep space missions.</td>
