 Published in the Fall 1997 issue of Technology Today, published by Southwest Research Institute. . SwRI scientists draw on planetary and cometary knowledge to understand better why large cities are getting hotter by Daniel Boice, Ph. Daniel Boice is a senior research scientist in the Planetary Science Section, Instrumentation and Space Research Division. His previous experience includes numerical simulations of the dynamics and chemistry in the atmospheres of comets, planets, and cool stars.</td>

 Lysiak Realistic computer simulations are replacing scale models and expensive, full-scale mockups in the search for the best site for shipboard antenna arrays. MacNaughton Technology Today talks with Vice President Dr. Wellinghoff Materials scientists are developing a novel restorative material for use in dental composites. The material, made from tantalum oxide and silica nanoparticle fillers in a liquid crystal monomer matrix, retains desirable properties of existing restoratives while avoiding short-comings such as susceptibility to shrinking and cracking. Barajas Engineers have designed and built a unique, virtual-long multiphase flow loop to study hydrates, ice-like solids that can form in deep-water flow lines, blocking hydrocarbon production.</td>

 Both MICAS and PEPE represent a new direction for the evolution of science instruments for interplanetary spacecraft. These two instruments are meant to take over a large part of the functions of five other instruments that had typically flown on NASA's deep space missions. The NASA peer-review process has selected 15 scientists to conduct investigations on DS1 using both MICAS and PEPE, and also using measurements from the spacecraft engineering diagnostics systems for serendipitous data. Additional Technologies to be Tested The other technologies to be tested by DS1 are all designed to improve the engineering environment in deep space. All can be expected to reduce costs and increase frequency of space exploration missions.</td>
