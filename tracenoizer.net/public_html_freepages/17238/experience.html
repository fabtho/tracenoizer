Daniel Boice is a senior research scientist in the Planetary Science Section, Instrumentation and Space Research Division. His previous experience includes numerical simulations of the dynamics and chemistry in the atmospheres of comets, planets, and cool stars. Currently he is analyzing the many observations taken of comets Hyakutake and Hale-Bopp to yield a better global understanding of comets. The cool serenity of the countryside can be an irresistible lure, especially after a week of congested traffic, irritable city dwellers, and unbearable heat.">

 Each Center accepts undergraduates each summer to join the research projects. . This allows students to experience first-hand how basic research is carried out, and to contribute consequentially. Students who are in those groups traditionally under-represented in science (women, members of under-represented minorities, and those with disabilities) are particularly urged to apply. An increasing number of Sites can meet the needs of physically challenged students.</td>

 About 75 librarians participate on this discussion group. One of the chief advantages of this discussion group is the collegiality of the participants. Since they have all gone through a similar experience, questions and comments are freely put forth without fear of blame or reproach. Also, since the questions go to a closed group, a director knows the questions will not be read by his or her staff or supervisor. These reunions have proved a good avenue for participants from different years to meet each other and for mentors to meet other mentors and first-year directors.</td>

 Along the way, I had taken a course in astronomy which got me very excited. After teaching science in the New York City school system, I enrolled in a master's degree program in astronomy at Connecticut Wesleyan University, under the direction of Arthur R. This was my first experience since junior high school with individual attention. program in astronomy at the University of Pittsburgh upon finishing my master's degree. Shortly afterwards, I switched to the Department of Earth and Planetary Science and finished with a dissertation on the spectral properties of the Galilean satellites of Jupiter under the sponsorship of a very patient advisor, Bruce W.</td>
