 Young Engineers and Scientists Program 1997 Version Web Page Welcome to the YES program Web page. The YES program was designed to open students' minds to the world of engineering and science in order to delineate and clarify different career fields and to offer them the opportunity to explore their interests. This is an enriching summer program for high school juniors and seniors held at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas. Participating students are interested in taking ISM (Independent Study Mentorship). YES helps these students find a mentor and get a head start on their project.</td>

 . SwRI scientists draw on planetary and cometary knowledge to understand better why large cities are getting hotter by Daniel Boice, Ph. Daniel Boice is a senior research scientist in the Planetary Science Section, Instrumentation and Space Research Division. His previous experience includes numerical simulations of the dynamics and chemistry in the atmospheres of comets, planets, and cool stars. Currently he is analyzing the many observations taken of comets Hyakutake and Hale-Bopp to yield a better global understanding of comets.</td>
