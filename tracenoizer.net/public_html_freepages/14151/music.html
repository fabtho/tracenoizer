 Films have not only given an illusion of seeing but also of hearing the past. Filmmakers have thus described history through sounds well before historians understood that also our auditive milieu has a history and can express history. In addition to the creation of this soundscape, films also include music which may be historically significant. This article aims to consider the role of music in the making of historical meanings. My argument is that music can crucially participate in creating the historical atmosphere of a film.</td>

 . I have worked with master instrumentalists from many backgrounds and from them have drawn the virtuosos who form my ensemble, Qantara. Together we explore the possibilities of music rooted in Arabic traditional sound that crosses cultures and styles. When it works well, the sounds and the ties feel natural. My gratitude goes to my colleagues and fellow musicians for their great contribution.</td>
