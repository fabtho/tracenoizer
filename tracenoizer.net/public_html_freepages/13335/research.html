 Best to bookmark this main page for the most recent locations. Many thanks for those teachers who have suggested sites to add to this page. See the Search Tools in the Research and Critical Thinking page, and Research-It. I have also found John December's site -- Welcome to the Top of the Web -- to be an excellent starting point for research.

Request an Exam Copy Comment on this product Purchasing information Email this page to a colleague Description Research Methods thoroughly covers both quantitative- and qualitative-oriented research. Unlike many texts which begin with an introduction to research and then move directly to how to conduct research, this text develops critical thinking skills about research and is designed to produce knowledgeable and informed critical research consumers. Each chapter builds on the information in preceding ones to focus on the importance of research methodology and interpretation rather than many competitors' traditional coverage of statistical calculations and analyses.</td>

 What Are the Ethical Principles and Codes of Conduct for Research. . To become a consumer of critical research, one must develop certain critical thinking skills about research, such as the ability to read about and understand an investigation; the knowledge to determine the value of the obtained data; the intuitive skills to determine the adequacy of the research design; the experience to determine if there are other explanations for the obtained results; and finally, the good judgment to assess the adequacy of conclusions and claims. Each chapter builds on the information in preceding ones to focus on the importance of research methodology and interpretation rather than mere statistical calculations and analyses. The thorough and extensive coverage of all research methods combined with a focus on critical thinking makes this text truly unique.</td>
