 It lays out a logico-historical thread to help make some sense of our switched-on disjunctive techno world. Electronic Civil Disobedience is promised for the Winter of 1995. The Projects sections is fairly lively with such titles as ADDICTIONMANIA, USELESS TECHNOLOGY, and CULTRONIX. It contrasts pseudo ads for hi-tech weaponry with pseudo catalogue listings for hi-tech kitchen appliances.

 There is a even a family page with documentation of a couple going through IVF, and a childrens' book on assisted reproduction. Underneath all the spectacle, there is a critical subtext aimed at directing the viewer toward a more skeptical view of the utopian presentation. Project visitors use the BioCom CD-ROM to take donor screening tests, and to gather information on reproductive technology. If visitors pass the screening test, they are given a certificate of genetic merit. Visitors who acquire a certificate can go onto give a cell sample for cryo-preservation.</td>
