 The Digital Audio Music List by Howard Ferstler is unique for its detailed exploration of the technology behind high-definition recordings. In this book the author goes beyond identifying excellent recordings and explains the techniques used in making them, the analysis of various kinds of recorded sound, and the nature of the equipment used to reproduce the performance. He discusses recording techniques and approaches, emphasizing the relationship between microphone placement, recording equipment, and the resulting sound. Ferstler provides the reader with tools for listening critically and also points out differences on specific recordings, Going beyond merely listing a recording, the author describes in detail the different kinds of encoding and decoding systems and their effect on it. He also includes test and sampler recordings that are useful in evaluating systems and understanding specific recording techniques.</td>
