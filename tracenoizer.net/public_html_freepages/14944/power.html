 .) has decided that it is important for members of the association be seen as responsible members of the community and keep model aircraft noise down to an acceptable and legal level. With the motor at full power the measurement will be taken at 90 degrees from the model on both the left and right sides as well as from the front and the rear (i. The sound level meter shall be place on a stand 30cm. The noise measurement will be the average of the four readings taken.</td>

 We present expressions for the compression ratio which can be reached, under the light of Shannon's noiseless coding theorem, for a linearly quantized stochastic Gaussian signal (noise). The compression ratio decreases logarithmically with the amplitude of the frequency spectrum P(f) of the noise. Entropy values and compression rates are shown to depend on the shape of this power spectrum, given different normalizations. ..</td>
