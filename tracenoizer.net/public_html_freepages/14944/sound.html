 "On the Use of Time-Frequency Reassignment in Additve Sound Modeling," Kelly Fitz and Lippold Haken, submitted to Journal of the AES, December 2001. . Loris supports modified resynthesis and manipulations of the model data, such as time- and frequency-scale modification and sound morphing. Loris includes support and wrapper code for building extension modules for various scripting languages (Python, Tcl, Perl). A graphical interface to some of the sound modeling and morphing functionality of Loris is provided by Fossa, a QT-based GUI written by Susanne Lefvert.</td>

 The G string which is the highest string, I looked at as a ride cymbal. My low E string, I looked at like a gong, and my A string I looked at as a bass drum. I was also looking at this concept of sound by which you were playing, but you weren't thinking of notes. The more I studied, I realized we were dealing with the vibration of sound and understood how vibrating sound changes properties. You have to just vibrate it enough so that it changes property and people perceive it in different way.</td>
