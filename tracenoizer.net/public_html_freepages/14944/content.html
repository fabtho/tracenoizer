 Kolmogorov-Chaitin information theory is a totally different topic (and one that I know more about than Shannon). K-C is a version of information theory derived from computer science. It studies what it calls the information content of a string. K-C information theory is interesting in that it considers the size of the "decoding machine" used to interpret a string to be a part of the measure of information content of that string. K-C information theory is absolutely fascinating, and has been used fairly widely in a lot of interesting ways.</td>

 Most people surf on their own time, using their own bandwidth, or that of their employer, school or business. Let's not say that it's bad to have advertising or sponsors on a web page. If a web site owner feels compelled to be compensated beyond the identity and residual benefits of the content, and wants some cash income from the site then there are few other ways to fulfill that need. It's the way in which these ends are accomplished that is the focus of this article. We don't necessarily want to make value judgments, but rather provide some sort of yardstick with which to rate relative degrees of spam on a web page.</td>
