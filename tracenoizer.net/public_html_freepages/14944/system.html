 He was working for Bell Labs, and his fundamental interest was in communication over noisy links. (The fundamental paper that first proposed Shannon IT was titled "Communication in the Presence of Noise". Shannon theory is thus the root of the creationist claim that "randomness cannot add information to a system". Kolmogorov-Chaitin information theory is a totally different topic (and one that I know more about than Shannon). K-C is a version of information theory derived from computer science.</td>

 Noise figure, attenuators, VSWR calculations, and more. Download EME SNR Spreadsheet by AL7EB (based on original by DF9CY). Excel spreadsheet calculates system noise figurre, system sensitivity, and EME path signal to noise ratio. Very high speed methods for greater success on meteor scatter. Alternatives to computers for High Speed CW meteor scatter.</td>
