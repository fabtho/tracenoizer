 Entropy values and compression rates are shown to depend on the shape of this power spectrum, given different normalizations. .es We approach the theoretical problem of compressing a signal dominated by Gaussian noise. We present expressions for the compression ratio which can be reached, under the light of Shannon's noiseless coding theorem, for a linearly quantized stochastic Gaussian signal (noise). The compression ratio decreases logarithmically with the amplitude of the frequency spectrum P(f) of the noise.</td>

 . An overview is given below for the quick reference of the audience. AN OVERVIEW ON NOISE POLLUTION AND CONTROL IN HONG KONG NOISE POLLUTION The Problem of Noise Different people may respond differently to the same level of noise. But above certain levels, noise can affect everybody. It can lead to hearing loss and mental stress and irritation.</td>

 The result is clearer speech at the receiving end, even when it is transmitted from a very noisy location. Moreover, the reduction in the level of background noise also leads to better detection of silence periods in speech, resulting in dramatic savings in bandwidth utilization for telecommunication protocols that employ variable rate coding systems. One problem is that because they control multiple devices, it is hard to incorporate all potentially needed functionality in the form of buttons. Voice activation would solve that problem, making the device much more compact and user-friendly. Clarity CVC would add significant value to this application since it can select the user's voice towards robustly recognizing the specific command.</td>
