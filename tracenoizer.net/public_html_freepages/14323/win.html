 Walrond finished the game with four walks and six strikeouts. How does it feel to pitch the first no-hitter in New Haven Ravens history. I was just going out there trying to keep us in the game, just trying to give us a chance to try to win the game in the bottom of the seventh. I was trying to get the ball back in the strike zone and try to let the defense work. You got two in the bottom of the seventh and you ended up getting the win.</td>
