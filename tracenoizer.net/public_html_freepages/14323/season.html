The team edged out NCAA champions Georgia by just eight votes. Today's ranking marks the first time since the 1988-89 season that any Illinois sports team has been ranked No. During that period both the men's basketball and gymnastics teams earned that status, but no other school team has since followed their success. Senior Mike Kosta reminded everyone that the season still has many games to go, "Our main goal is still to finish the season with the national championship, and this is just the first step for us to get there.">
