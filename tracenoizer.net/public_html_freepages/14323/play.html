 1 seed, in the West Region, went instead to Cincinnati, which had a school-record 30 victories this season. 2 in the West, the teams could meet in the regional final. Lee Fowler, head of the NCAA selection committee, said committee members had the top seeds in mind going into league tournament play and saw no need to change their choices after the weekend's events, which also included a loss by Maryland in the ACC tournament semifinals. "We do look at the total season from start to finish, and we very much want to make sure that one game doesn't influence us too much," Fowler said. Wanting to keep more teams close to home to begin the tournament, the NCAA is sending several teams to first- and second-round sites without regard to the regionals in which they will compete.</td>
