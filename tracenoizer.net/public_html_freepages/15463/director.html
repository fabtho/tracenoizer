 The simulation of free round and swirling jets using LES and wall jets using wall-pressure-velocity correlations are currently worked on. Analysis of data obtained from either LES or experiments is done using proper orthogonal decomposition, linear stochastic estimation, wavelets and pseudo-flow visualisation to educe turbulence structures. Professor Pollard is a founding member, former Associate Director and Director of the Centre for Advanced Gas Combustion Technology of Queen's University. Funding NSERC (Research and Equipment), AEG Sun Microsystems, Pharmaceutical industry contracts (IP protected). .</td>
