 . About the Department The prime instructional goal of the department is the education and training of physicians who will apply the knowledge and skills of this and other medical disciplines in family practice. Implicit in this goal is the necessity for continual development of new knowledge and its application in the clinical activities of the department. The Department of Family Medicine was founded in 1971 and is involved with instruction of medical students in a number of ways. Family medicine fellowship training programs are available to develop teaching and research skills for future academic faculty.</td>

 The Center's mission is to provide a forum to help family business members better work and live together, perpetuate the family business, and have a smooth management succession from one generation to the next. The Center encourages family business owners to plan for business transfer to the next generation by offering quarterly seminars and monthly luncheons on topics such as estate planning, succession management, second-generation successes, and other applicable topics. In January of 1998, we enhanced our program and our name to "McMurry University Leadership Development and Family Business Center". The Center will continue to bring the members the latest information on family run businesses as well as bring to the non-family member employees a chance to learn and grow in the business.

 Through circumstances and chance, I was able to sneak into the Age of Empires 2 Release To Manufacturer party. I had never seen anything like AoK, it completely blew me away. After playing one-too-many all night Age LAN games with friends and hearing the reputation Ensemble had as a development studio, I knew this is where I belonged. The sound engine is solid, and the in-game tools associated with it are incredibly slick and easy to use, and just wait until you hear the stuff we can do with music. The Save, Load, and Record game-stuff is dressed to impress, and it too has some features that would get me in trouble if I were to snitch.</td>
