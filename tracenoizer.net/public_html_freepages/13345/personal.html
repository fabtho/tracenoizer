 First, enter your first name and your last name into the form on the TraceNoizer Homepage, then click on "run". TraceNoizer searches for information connected to your first name and surname on the Internet, then analyzes it using statistical means. Finally TraceNoizer generates a personal homepage for you. This homepage contains text and pictures connected to your name which are structured in a thematic manner. If you agree with this page you have the option of automatically uploading it on a webserver offering free webspace(like yahoo geocities).</td>
