 Data Model and Reference Data Library have been under dynamic development thus making life of software vendors difficult. That situation is now being improved with harmonisation of efforts and proper versioning. The list is not exhaustive and complete in the details because they are not always released easily.

 The feature set is locked so that development engineers can work closely with QA engineers to test edge conditions, identify bugs, fix them, and ensure that they remain fixed. I prefer to have QA engineers punish nightly builds with suites of tests while development engineers fix the problems identified by previous days' tests. QA is considered complete when the product passes all the tests we can dream up. And finally, once all of the QA issues have been addressed, the final product is delivered. Naturally, the process doesn't stop there, but starts over -- in fact, it likely has already started over.</td>

Why would they effectively breach the complete functionality of the application proxy server. If they fully trust the other entity they should add in the appropriate rulesets to allow such behavior. The idea of "I have a VPN therefore I bypass my proxy based services" is obscene.</td>
