 If the firewall did support filtering _in_addition_to_ encrypting the link between the two firewalls, the hacker will have a much more difficult time in crossing from the compromised network to your network. SCENARIO 2 Someone on the other network happened to accidently upload a Worm. While the other entity's personnel are frantically running around trying to prevent the spread of the Worm and trying to reboot the systems so they can be cleaned up, the Worm is happily hopping from system to system. Nothing stops the Worm from getting to your network since the firewall is only using an encrypted tunnel from firewall to firewall. Of course, if the firewall were to provide applications filtering correctly, the damage would be contained to the contaminated network.</td>
