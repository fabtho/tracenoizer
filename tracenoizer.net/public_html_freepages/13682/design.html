 Task flow diagrams of user interactions model the entire system. Evaluations from the target market refine these schematics, shaping the look and feel of the final product. I cannot emphasize enough the importance of seeking market feedback to build solid and meaningful metaphors into the design. These concepts drive the user experience and make or break the success of the final product. Next, a talented development team must be assembled and backed by a dependable, project management-oriented implementation infrastructure.</td>
