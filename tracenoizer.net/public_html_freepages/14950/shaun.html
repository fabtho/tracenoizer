 In Lance's spare time, you'll find him cruising on his GoldWing GL1500 and eagerly awaiting the arrival of our GL1800. He makes sure it gives the viewers everything they need to know in a visually pleasing layout because the website is where most of our customers come from. Shaun also takes care of any other designs that are needed, and takes care of customers and bookings. In his spare time Shaun can be found, like Lance, searching for New Zealand's best roads in his Toyota sportscar. .</td>
