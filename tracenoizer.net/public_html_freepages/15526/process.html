 He complements this single neuron approach with functional magnetic resonance imaging, using a new technique developed for studying monkeys in his laboratory. His work suggests that the neurons interpreting what we see are distributed over the entire visual pathway, as opposed to residing in a single higher vision association area of the brain. This selection process is not limited to visual stimuli but may also apply to auditory and other sensory stimuli. The Minerva Foundation was established in 1984 to promote basic research in vision and the brain. .</td>
