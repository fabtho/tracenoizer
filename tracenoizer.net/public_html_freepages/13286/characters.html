 Most of the one-line descriptions of the characters are from Fredrik Ekman, back from when he edited the list of Disney characters with translations into lots of languages. . Disney Comics Characters Disney Comics Characters The English names of the characters are used here. From the character pages you can find the translations into other languages, from a database of translations. Hopefully this will make it easier to find the character you are looking for (even if you don't know the name), but be aware that these "universes" often mix with each other, so you might find Grandma Duck in a Mouse story or Tinker Bell in a Duck story.</td>

 The relatively starless Merrie Melodies were the first Warner toons to switch to color, which they did in 1934. Several animators were promoted to director, including Isadore "Friz" Freleng, who remained in that position until the 1960s. It was Freleng who introduced such classic characters as Sylvester Pussycat and Speedy Gonzales. Harman and Ising owned the Bosko character, so Schlesinger's crew had to come up with new ones. The first, Buddy, inspired little enthusiasm, although for some reason they kept making cartoons about him for two years.</td>
