 Whenever faced with danger, Popeye eats a can of spinach and is instantly transformed into a strongman. He fights his enemies with Herculean power and rushes to the rescue of Olive Oil, his main squeeze, whenever there is trouble. She was created for short cartoon movies in 1930, but soon became a world-class cartoon idol together with her partner Bimbo and her dog Pudgy. A New York native, she is an excellent singer and dancer and a bona fide movie star. Her baby-face and sultry style have been attracting fans from all over the world for more than 70 years.</td>

 ) At first listen, it's easy to hear what we're told to hear, "god damn stupid nigger. " Donald is rarely easy to understand, and people have supposedly heard him say all sorts of risque things. In 1995, a 1937 Mickey Mouse cartoon called "Clock Cleaners" contained in Walt Disney Cartoon Classics series' video "Fun on the Job" made the news because it allegedly included a frustrated Donald Duck shouting "Fuck you. ", leading Wal-Mart to pull the video from its shelves. Funny how nobody ever noticed this until the cartoon was nearly sixty years old, though.</td>
