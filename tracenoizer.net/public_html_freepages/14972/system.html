 Unlike spreadsheets, databases or general purpose statistics packages, The Survey System was designed specifically for questionnaires; so The Survey System saves you time. . The Survey System handles all phases of survey projects, from creating questionnaires through data entry, interviewing or Web surveys to producing tables, graphics and text reports that make you look good.

 . Systems is the largest research area in the Computer Laboratory covering hardware, communications hardware and software, operating systems and distributed systems. Past systems developed here include Edsac, the Titan operating system, the Cambridge Ring and the Cambridge Distributed Computing System. The thrust is open distributed processing with an object orientated approach. We look to support emerging distributed applications in which users and devices may be mobile and may have multimedia presentation requirements.</td>
