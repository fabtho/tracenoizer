 . The aim of this workshop, which is the third of a series, is to bring together people with research interests in this interdisciplinary topic. As with the previous editions (1997 and 1999), the proceedings will be published by Springer Verlag in the Lecture Notes on Computer Science (LNCS) series. The scientific program of EMMCVPR-2001 will include the presentation of invited talks and contributed research papers. et Leurs Applications, Ecole Normale Superieure, Cachan, France.</td>

 Alternatively, it may look at energy supply required for satisfying a given demand of secondary energy under different conditions, taking into account resource and technology availability. In the context of planning and decision making, the energy demand analysis should provide projections of future energy requirements consistent with the overall economic and social development within a given set of policy assumptions. The computer tools developed and used for energy demand analysis may incorporate analysis of demand management measures and energy conservation policies. characterisation of the different energy chains for electricity generation covering technical performance, economic parameters and emissions and other residuals. In most of the computer tools described in the document the electricity sector is treated with a high degree of disaggregation and, in many cases, a specific module deals with the electricity system analysis.</td>
