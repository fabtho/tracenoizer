 of Science and Technology Byron Dom, IBM Almaden Research Center, USA M. . The aim of this workshop, which is the third of a series, is to bring together people with research interests in this interdisciplinary topic. As with the previous editions (1997 and 1999), the proceedings will be published by Springer Verlag in the Lecture Notes on Computer Science (LNCS) series. The scientific program of EMMCVPR-2001 will include the presentation of invited talks and contributed research papers.</td>

 Through integrated research and education, the reserves help communities develop strategies to deal successfully with these coastal resource issues. . National Estuarine Research Reserves The National Estuarine Research Reserve System protects and studies estuarine areas through a network of 25 reserves. These important coastal habitats are used as spawning grounds and nurseries for at least two-thirds of the nation's commercial fish and shellfish. The wetlands associated with estuaries buffer uplands from flooding.</td>
