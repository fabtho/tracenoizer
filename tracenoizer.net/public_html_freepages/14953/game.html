 . "Shuggy's" performances last year earned him the Supporters Player of the Year and British Player of the Year awards at the Blaze. Shaun is the youngest of three hockey playing brothers and followed his father and brothers' skates learning the game in his home-town of Durham, playing at the top level for twelve seasons before coming to the Blaze last year. He was, once again, selected for the Great Britain squad that travelled to Slovenia for the World Championships in April 2001. A great skater, very strong on the puck and with an eye for passing, Johnson won a lot of friends in the Blaze camp last season.</td>
