 When a surprise situation arises, a D10 is rolled for each character and each adversary involved. This roll is modified by any Surprise bonus awarded by the AW. The higher numbers will have the upper hand over the lower numbers. The difference between the numbers is the number of Melee Phases that the winner will have free action in. The free Melee Phases begin in Melee Phase 1 of the combat Segment.</td>

 As a father you begin to better understand the true character of your heart with every passing day. If your character is selfish, that is what your child learns. On the other hand, if you are a giving and loving person, you will see the sme characteristics in your child. On a daily basis I need to look at my heart to see if my motives are pure, and if not, I need to get my heart right with God, then with my children. I need to ask for their forgiveness, and tell them I am wrong.</td>
