 One of his first major hires was Paddy Holahan, who was put in charge of the company's marketing, product development and business development in November 1996. For several months the company generated little or no revenue as Rooney directed the technical staff away from consultancy and into product development. In August 1997, Rooney made his second big appointment, recruiting Aidan Gallagher as director of sales. A couple of months later the company unveiled its next offering, a revamped version of its UniCERT certification authority system, the star product in a range of software for helping to make internet commerce secure. In June 1998, Rooney completed the key quartet of managers to run the business by hiring John O'Sullivan.</td>
