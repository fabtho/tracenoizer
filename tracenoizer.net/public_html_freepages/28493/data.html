 If process data is created by an activity as an output parameter, it is intended that both activity and process data item attributes be determined, activity to carry part of the identification and process data item to carry the role the process data played in the activity. . process_data Entity process_data An abstract supertype, carrying the behavior of data being used in or created by an activity. Parameter names may be associated with use of data via process data item.

 Distributed software engineering (DSE) efforts offer difficult challenges to those who need to monitor and manage the overall process. Without the capability to know what is happening in the process, the risk of failing to produce a quality product on schedule increases greatly. With Internet-based DSE, the opportunity exists to capture data from the process at relatively low cost, since so much of the process is already being supported by technology which can be instrumented. Our position is that capturing event traces from these processes can be done fairly easily, and will enable the use of analysis and management tools that provide feedback to the enactors and managers, thus improving the overall process and enabling the efficient production of high-quality software products.
