 Integration in Manufacturing - domain 8 The goal of activities in Integration in Manufacturing is, through the development of new IT solutions, to accelerate and enhance the ability of European manufacturing industry to capitalise on the emergence of a powerful global Information Infrastructure and to integrate the various strands of work as part of a strategic initiative for the European manufacturing industries.

This also requires a clear identification and redeployment of traditional business functions, and a major challenge to which companies must respond is the integration of organisation structures, advanced information and communication technology, and people. One of the consequences of the market-driven approach is the need to reduce the time required to bring new products to the market. There is a corresponding move towards concurrent engineering development, closer integration in design between manufacturers and their component suppliers and customers, and the development of integrated supply and distribution logistics systems.</td>
