 . My approach is to address this issue within the context of the organization. I have included the following statement, "A correctional facility depends on many systems to sustain the operation. In other words most problems are systems problems". This is a major lead statement in introducing a section on systems related to emergency management.</td>

 . Chargeback System Services - Mainframe, UNIX, and LAN chargeback specialists. Chargeback Systems Resource accounting, capacity planning, cost allocation, and chargeback systems are critical to the efficient management of any data center. Chargeback systems are designed to accurately and equitably allocate the cost of computing facilities to the various users of the service. Properly implemented, these systems provide the basis to chargeback the cost of existing IBM mainframe, UNIX open systems, and LAN based computer resources.</td>

 As individual rays cant be identical, all discrepancies can be taken into account in mathematical correction problem of received original data. . even real one-ray systems should be simulated as multiple rays taking into account spatial non-uniformity of image formation system in realized sighting angles. Taking into account spatial inhomogeneity in solution of distortion compensation tasks will for sure give the better result in comparison with the liner spatial-uniform model of effective PSF. For the produced and designed modern multiple rays radiovision systems the developed theory of multiple rays radiovision systems looks very actual and useful.</td>
