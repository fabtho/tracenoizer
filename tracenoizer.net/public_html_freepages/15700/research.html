 . To investigate the proximity and apparent height issues in VMC, Huang created a setting in which two people see each other through high and low cameras and monitors, making them appear artificially short and tall, at two distances. The research found that the apparently tall person was more influential but only when the participants appeared to be far apart. The seminar is sponsored by the Collaboratory for Research on Electronic Work. .</td>

 degree with Professor Chiu in Mechanical Engineering at UConn. Wei received his Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2000. His Master's thesis research focused on experimental research of cavitation phenomena of pump system and modeling of the fluid field in a pump system. He received his Batchelor's in Engineering degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 1997. .</td>
