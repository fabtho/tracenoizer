 Click here for the order form of Special Autographed Edition . . Mrs Huang (1924-1999) was born and raised in Shanghai and was the first Chinese woman to be awarded an MBA degree by the University of Chicago in 1950. The Fund will be used for the 'Grace Wei Huang Memorial Prize' for promotion of business studies in the University of Hong Kong and will consist of two kinds of awards. The first is a non-cash award to be presented each to a graduate of the HKU MBA Programme and a graduate of the HKU-Fudan University IMBA Programme, in recognition of outstanding academic performance.</td>

 The seminar is sponsored by the Collaboratory for Research on Electronic Work. . To investigate the proximity and apparent height issues in VMC, Huang created a setting in which two people see each other through high and low cameras and monitors, making them appear artificially short and tall, at two distances. The research found that the apparently tall person was more influential but only when the participants appeared to be far apart.
