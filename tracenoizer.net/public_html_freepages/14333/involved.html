<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" William Tennent's Glen Dolton is coaching the North for the second time. The South will be directed by Neshaminy's Joe Blair, who led the North squad during his coaching days at Archbishop Wood. Dolton is excited to coach in the game for more reasons than being involved with so many quality players. He believes his selection to coach is another honor bestowed on his team, which had the best season in the school's history. "I think it's great for the kids and the program," Dolton said.">

 I'll see if I want to continue on the operations end or go back to buying. You cannot have a weak stomach, because it can be brutal. Also, most buying areas have a lot of travel involved, so you have to set your lifestyle up to accommodate that. You have to be able to take a good amount of failure. You're judged every single day based on your plans.</td>
