 feng shui manage to jive with commodities rarely seen in the standard fare of the cut and pasters -- intelligence and wit. html "one of the nicest musical surprises i have had in a long time, this is not a mix CD nor a remix album, but a compilation in the truest sense of the word . some of the tracks remind me of the good ol' days when trip-hop staple mo' wax records couldn't do a thing wrong. with mo' wax on the sidelines, maybe tar is picking up the torch. regardless, this is the first really essential compilation of 2002.</td>

 Programmes of preparation for nurses, midwives and health visitors to prescribe from the Nurse Prescribers' Extended Formulary began in January 2002, and the first nurses are expected to qualify in April 2002. All nurses, midwives and health visitors carrying out extended independent prescribing responsibilities will undergo a programme of preparation at degree level (level three in England). The programme will include 25 taught days in the university plus 12 nurse days when a designated medical practitioner will provide the student with supervision, support and opportunities to develop competence in prescribing practice. There will be assessment of theory and prescribing competence. The programme will be part-time spread over a period of three months.</td>

 An Aquaarius by birth, lovable by faith, 47 years of age. Like to read, go to movies, walk on the beach, candle light dinners and I like to open the door for a woman the old fashioned way. Please write to help fill the days and make it a little brighter. I'm well liked and average looking I guess one would say, live in New Orleans. I'm into anything that is safe and "fun" for all, so take a chance, and lets make it worth both our whiles.</td>
