The sprints should be improved this season, and the field events definitely will be better, where the Mustangs barely scored any points last season. Vaughns is already a future athlete-of-the-year, and the team has talent everywhere, just no depth. Ridgewood is no longer head and shoulders above the competition -- but is still the favorite, by virtue of superior numbers and a slight downturn in competition. The Rams have to overcome youth and inexperience, as well as the loss of a stellar crop of seniors from last season's regional champions.">

 The team's strengths are the middle distance races, while the hurdles and long distances are weaknesses. The sprints should be improved this season, and the field events definitely will be better, where the Mustangs barely scored any points last season.

 I plan many many more visits there and hope to hear more great music. he was amazing, i want to know if he is still playing there or if he has moved on and maybe gotten a record contract. We both intend to appear many times and often in the near future. We loved the place, especially the bushwackers and the live entertainment. Thanks to the male bartender who gave me a free bag of peanuts last night.</td>
