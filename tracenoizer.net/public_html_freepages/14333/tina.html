 A stranger appears, requesting that the two women rent him a room at the villa. The lodger is a scholar and biographer of the composer Aspern, and he believes that Juliana may have in her possession the score of an operatic masterpiece, believed lost, that Aspern wrote for her shortly before his death sixty years earlier. Juliana dies, and Tina suggests that the stranger may have the score to the opera if he will consent to marry her. He rejects her offer and plans to leave the next day. In the morning, he tells Tina that he has changed his mind and must have the score.</td>
