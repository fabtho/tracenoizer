 "We're in a learning process and we need to gain some experience," said UMD coach Marilyn Ritz, whose team is 9-10-2 overall and 3-3 in the conference. "We've played well in spots and we've played six good innings in a lot of games only to get hurt by one bad inning. "We're working hard though, and everybody's giving their best effort. " UMD hung tough in the opener until the Huskies (9-7, 2-0 LEC), the home team because their field is still covered by snow, scored three runs in the bottom of the fifth to increase their lead to 7-0. Jess Macedo knocked in a pair of runs with a two-out single in the top of the sixth to put the Corsairs on the scoreboard, and Jen Kelley added a run-scoring single in the seventh.</td>

 It's a window onto homelessness that allows you to make your own decisions. So I had to adapt my views to fit the reality of what I was encountering. Many of their problems are individual issues, but it's hard to separate the two. If you're the one with the problem maybe a mental disability as subtle as a bad attitude - you're the one who sits out. There's less housing, less welfare, so the losers nowadays lose big.</td>
