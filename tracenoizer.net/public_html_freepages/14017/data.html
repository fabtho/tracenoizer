 , co-author of the study and associate professor of nephrology in the U-M Medical School and co-medical director of renal transplantation at UMHS. "In the case of cyclosporine, it appears the answer is yes all around. " The study looked back at the experiences of 29,786 people who received kidney transplants between 1994 and 1997, and whose medical histories were recorded anonymously by the United States Renal Data System. Kaplan worked with co-author Herwig-Ulf Meier-Kriesche, M. , an assistant professor of nephrology at UMMS, to sort out which had been treated with the older and newer forms of cyclosporine, and how they fared during the first four years after their transplant.</td>

 Nephrology Clinical Research Programs The Nephrology Clinical Research Programs continue to advance the science of renal care. Jamerson continue to be investigators for the national African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension study, which has made significant observations on the optimal management of hypertension and renal disease in African Americans. Figure 2 shows data from a recent New England Journal of Medicine paper by Dr. Port and colleagues who have demonstrated that the mortality rate of Americans with end-stage renal disease is declining, especially in those patients with diabetes. Similar improvements are observed for patients after the second year of dialysis.</td>
