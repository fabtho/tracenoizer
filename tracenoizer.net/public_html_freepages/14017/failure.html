 A new study answers a six-year question over long-term advantages from a new form of cyclosporine. CDT May 14 Kidney transplant patients fare better over the long term with newer form of "gold standard" drug, study finds ANN ARBOR, MI - A reformulation of the "gold standard" drug against kidney transplant rejection not only costs less and gets absorbed better - it also helps transplant recipients keep their new organs longer. Patients who took the microemulsion form of the drug, introduced in 1995, had a significantly lower risk of suffering chronic failure of their transplanted kidney than those who used the older form of the same drug. The results, from one of the largest studies of its kind, will be presented May 14 in Chicago at Transplant 2001, the annual meeting of the American Society of Transplantation. "As the pharmaceutical industry continues to introduce new forms of established medications, we who care for patients must constantly ask the question, 'Is this really an improvement overall.</td>

 Nephron tubes are one cell layer thick and function to control chemical excretion and reabsorption between blood and urine. The ability of this cell layer to modulate a chemical balance depends on proteins that act like molecular building blocks (green, red, and purple structures) to localize transporter proteins (blue) in the cell. Mortality rates among patients undergoing hemodialysis have decreased during recent years, by 30 percent for those with diabetes (upper line) and by 5 percent for all other causes of renal failure (lower line). Rates are shown for the first year of dialysis and are adjusted to the average age, gender, and race distribution of new patients in 1997.
