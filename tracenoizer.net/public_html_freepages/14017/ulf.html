 It will serve as an invaluable resource for the transplant community over the coming years. The Renal Transplant Program performed almost 200 renal transplants last year with improvements in patient survival, posttransplant renal health, and cost-effectiveness. Ulf Meier and his colleagues have dissected the risks of immunosuppression in older and younger kidney transplant populations. The older group exhibits considerably higher rates of infectious complications from immunosuppression and much lower rates of rejection than the younger group. As a result, clinical strategies have been modified to reduce reliance on immunosuppressants in older patients.</td>
