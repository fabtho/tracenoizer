 Its intuitive interface and failure data graphing capabilities make it quite useful for estimating parameters and plotting failure data and confidence intervals. . Failure data analysis is the process of discovering the trends in product or system failure, and using them to predict future failures in similar situations. By learning these trends, you can attempt to correct or compensate for them, thereby improving product reliability. Failure data analysis can be used to study a variety of fields, practices, and disciplines.</td>
