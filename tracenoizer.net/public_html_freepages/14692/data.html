Failure data analysis is the process of discovering the trends in product or system failure, and using them to predict future failures in similar situations. By learning these trends, you can attempt to correct or compensate for them, thereby improving product reliability. Failure data analysis can be used to study a variety of fields, practices, and disciplines.">

 Data Requirements Currently, the Data Sharing Consortium contains only screening and qualification data. . Data Sharing Consortium (DSC) - Database Information Directory DSC Database Information The DSC database tracks screening, qualification, test and field data for components and systems. The results of failure analyses identifying the cause(s) of failure are provided when available. Obsolescence information is also provided to assist with life cycle management.</td>

 When decisions are costly or complex, managers and engineers often turn to QRA methods to help in the decision-making process. Key elements of any QRA include appropriate equipment failure rates, human error probabilities, and (sometimes) external event frequencies (e. In this course, you will learn practical methods for collecting, developing, and analyzing failure data for QRAs. We packed all the ABS Consulting data analysis experience that we could into this 2-day course. You will see extensive examples of data collection and data analysis methods, and you will learn how to combine limited plant failure data with industrial database information.</td>
