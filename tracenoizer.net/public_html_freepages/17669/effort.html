 The mammoth flying boat, created by Howard Hughes, achieved fame in its one-and-only flight on November, 2 1947. The Evergreen Museum won the right to display the historic aircraft in 1992 after the Disney Corporation terminated the lease on the Long Beach, California building where it had been on display since 1982. With an effort befitting the size of the worlds largest airplane, the HK-1 was disassembled and moved north. Plans for the Oregon museum were put on hold when its founder, Michael King Smith, was killed in a 1995 auto accident. After regrouping, the museum has moved steadily forward, raising funding and receiving most of the legal approvals needed to begin the construction.</td>

 Horsemastership achievers must be under 22 years of age (as of December 1st) and all badge work must be completed with a registered Morgan. The first two levels may be approved by youth club leaders or other qualified horsepersons, but the top three levels must be approved by an official AMHA horsemastership examiner. Badge work is challenging, but the rewards and benefits are well worth the effort. Patches and certificates are given to those who pass the first four levels of the program. Justin Morgan achievers receive a framed certificate and personalized jacket in addition to boundless recognition.</td>

 They chuckled, boylike, because they would be late for bed; and it was all mother Wendy's fault. When their voices died away there came cold silence over the lagoon, and then a feeble cry. With a last effort Peter pulled her up the rock and then lay down beside her. Even as he also fainted he saw that the water was rising. He knew that they would soon be drowned, but he could do no more.</td>
