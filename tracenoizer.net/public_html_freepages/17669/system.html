 The Regal Ridge Emerald project is just one of several Canadian and international gem exploration and development projects being considered by True North. Vertical Integration True North intends to take gemstones through all the value-added processes from mine to market. To produce finished gemstones, True North plans to develop an in-house cutting facility that uses a multi-stone faceting system. This system offers low operating costs along with high quality cutting, making the process competitive with the lower labour costs of overseas cutting facilities. Initially most gemstone production will be cut overseas, but as our facility gets built and economics allow, a greater proportion of our rough will be cut in-house.</td>
