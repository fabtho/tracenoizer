They shadowed physicians who are using telemedicine technologies, visited high-tech, or "smart," home healthcare facilities and explored new assistive technologies for disabled patients. As part of this practical approach to research, Charles was challenged to find new uses for technology in solving problems he observed in healthcare environments. "It was clear to me that Charles was already a great observer of people before he came to Intel," said Dishman. "His previous inventions were creative solutions to real-world problems he had identified.">
