 This primer describes the characteristics of lightning and provides information on recent activities in lightning research. . As part of their research activities, the members of this team have been investigating the causes and effects of lightning as well as analyzing a wide variety of atmospheric measurements related to thunderstorms. One of the primary objectives of this group is to determine the relationship between the electrical characteristics of storms and precipitation, convection, and severe weather. The data collected by the GHCC Lightning Team is routinely shared with scientists around the globe, resulting in numerous advancements in the field of Atmospheric Science.</td>

 A four-time Gold Glove winner, he's a big-time leader behind the dish and is excellent at blocking balls in the dirt. Charles has a quick release and an accurate arm which baserunners have come to respect over the years. A South Florida native, he returned to his original team when he signed with the Marlins after the 2000 season. With such a young and talented pitching staff, the Marlins will certainly benefit from Charles' wisdom and the way he handles a staff. Charles began 2000 with the Baltimore Orioles before being traded to the Chicago White Sox on July 29.</td>

 , Uppsala) The British Columbia Ectomycorrhizal Research Network (BCERN). . The Team is composed of personnel from Oregon State University, Department of Forest Science and the USDA Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station. We are actively pursuing research on the effects of various forest management approaches on ectomycorrhizal fungi in an ecosystem context. The development of survey and management protocols for conserving and monitoring biological diversity of forest fungi is another important area of concentration.</td>
