 , Uppsala) The British Columbia Ectomycorrhizal Research Network (BCERN). . The Team is composed of personnel from Oregon State University, Department of Forest Science and the USDA Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station. We are actively pursuing research on the effects of various forest management approaches on ectomycorrhizal fungi in an ecosystem context. The development of survey and management protocols for conserving and monitoring biological diversity of forest fungi is another important area of concentration.</td>
