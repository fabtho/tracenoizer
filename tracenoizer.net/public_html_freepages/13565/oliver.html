 Well for anyone who missed it you will definatly not want to miss him when he returns. Good times had by all and definatly many props to Mike, Rob and Joe for making this happen. the venue was a bit small for oliver but it certainly made things more intimate. cause jubei's set ( i think thats his name playing before oliver). didn't stay too long for lee osbourne's set, we left shortly after he got on.</td>
