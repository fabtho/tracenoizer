 (e-mail address) lubland is usually dead in wintertime, but you wouldn't know it from the juicy offerings this week. Drum'n'bass fans get a visit from a member of the esteemed Reprazent crew at the long-running weekly, Direct Drive. As a DJ, he's tight as a drum, and hopefully, the crowd will get a taste of some new Bristolian funk dubplates. Techno junkies who squeeze into the crowded confines of Guernica every week for Tronic Treatment will be happy to know the promoters have moved the night to the more spacious (and cabaret-licensed) Baktun. They baptized the space with Oliver Ho last week; this week features Tronic regulars Christian Smith and Jaesun.</td>
