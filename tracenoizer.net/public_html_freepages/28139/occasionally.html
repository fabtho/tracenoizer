From outside postmodern cultural studies this search for purity, for relief from the historical burden of the West, seems its distinguishing mark. The decadents saw that innocence and effectivity did not easily mix, and Derrida occasionally seems to recognize that you cannot "get out of" the business of the West--call it logocentrism or whatever--simply by getting into another one. You have to get out of business altogether, and enter the monastery--there to embark upon the discipline of sterility. In practice, postmodernist cultural studies has submitted to this discipline; it lacks only the self-understanding to embrace it.">
