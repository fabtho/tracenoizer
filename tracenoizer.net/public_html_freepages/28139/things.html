 But the site Lewitt decided to excevate, was his own flat on New York Lower East Side. First, he photographed everything in the place, from books and floorboards to toothbrushes, plants or cooking pots. Then he began to match the formal visual properties of all the things and lay them out side-by-side in grid-pattern groups of nine. Lewitt's interest in the subtle interplay between human emotion and spatial system - between enclosure and disclosure - has been central to his work ever since he became well-known as an artist in the early Sixties. To appreciate these works for what they are - and they are merely what they are - no big-deal symbolism is involved - you'll need time.</td>

 In moderate conditions a few inches can make a tremendous difference. In a real blow you might be sitting well in front of center. The tubular things are heavy (indestructable) hangers made from industrial lastic pipe. They fit over the outwale and jam securely with your weight. On a canoe with skinny gunwales the hangers can just sit over the top.</td>

 That that image which was hard won has been so successful can be vouched for by the fact that in travelling abroad the reputation of the Irish Film Board, of its chief executive and of its marketing executive are among the highest of any film producing country. They have done this on a limited budget but nonetheless with an application to promoting films which meant that Ireland, which has up to now never been known as a film producing country, has been recognised as being a successful film producing country. Two worrying things have happened as a result of the winding up of the board. Unless there is a great deal of publicity money available, which there seldom is, our film production will continue to be rather small budget productions. To do away with the Government agency which was giving the maximum assistance was a very foolish and a very disruptive thing to do.</td>
