 Now flex your thigh up against the underside of the center thwart. It feels like you are wearing your canoe like a boot. The Solostrap III includes a sliding hip stop that helps you maintain an extreme angle of heel when you want. Another seating option that I like for distance paddling is to pull the Solostrap back from the center thwart another six inches and paddle with your paddle-side leg bent at the knee. Lock your bent knee in the corner where the center thwart meets the gunwale.</td>
