 It will be facilitated and encouraged to continue that work. As long ago as 30 October 1984 when ministerial responsibility for the board lay with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the then Minister wrote to the chairman of the board requesting that they carry out a fundamental review of their effectiveness in achieving the objectives which led to the legislation establishing the board. It is clear from the official files that, in asking for that review, the former Minister for Industry and Commerce was seeking an evaluation of the role and effectiveness of the board in the period from its inception. In short, the report prepared on behalf of the board simply failed to address their problems or identify their opportunities. The board were specifically asked after the submission of their review to the Department of Industry and Commerce early in 1985 to indicate the employment content of their projects and their prospective profitability in terms of their investment.</td>

 The science side of the collaboration contribute to the provision of an early warning system - better ways to anticipate and detect new introductions and to predict their potential spread and biological behavior; improved risk assessments - both from a biological and socio-economic perspective; more effective ways to prevent entry and spread of harmful alien species; and, when these measures fail, ways to manage these organisms. In addition, regulatory policies and programs, including mechanisms, are needed to deal with pest pathways and intra-national spread of alien forest pests. However, it is becoming clear that the issues of alien forest pests, let alone alien invasive species, is beyond forest resource and quarantine agencies to deal with. New initiatives are underway in our countries to develop integrated approaches to addressing alien invasive organisms, and to avoid fragmentation of effort and direction. Early detection new introductions of alien forest pests is the theme of this year's study group meeting.</td>
