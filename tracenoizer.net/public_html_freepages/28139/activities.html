 There is a danger of giving to outsiders the right and authority to decide what films we make about our own country and that is not a good thing. The other consequence is that a Government organisation of this kind which has given one of the best images of Ireland abroad has now been done away with. Internationally, where most people keep abreast of other people's productive activities, the nature of the product is that it should be shown worldwide. Consequently, we would have an image abroad of a country which started a film industry but which industry has now been administered a rather wounding blow. A friend of mine has just returned from the United States where there has been a European Communities festival organised through the American Government's Federal American Film Industry with showings in both Washington and Chicago.</td>
