 The webbing seat really is comfortable, especially since there are a variety of ways to sit on it. The webbing seat is adjusted with a coated steel parachute harness buckle selected both for it's huge load carrying capacity and it's ability to release under tension. (You may at times pull your Solostrap so tight you'd otherwise have trouble getting it off your gunwales. ) The Solostrap III features a sliding cherry hip stop. ) Because the seat is a sling there is a tendency to slide down toward the middle.</td>

 During that time not a single independent Irish film was made without some, if not a large part of assistance, being given by the board. Despite the fact that it was a very small organisation with a very limited budget and a very small number of staff it proved to be one of the most cost-effective Government agencies in the whole State. It seems particularly foolish, even in times of economic cutbacks, to abolish an organisation which used their resources so productively and creatively. There is no evidence that any substitute body or existing body could assume those duties. The Irish Film Board gave pre-production development money to people trying to initiate the making of films.</td>
