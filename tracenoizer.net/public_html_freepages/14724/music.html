<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" We did a huge amount of hands-on research in Paris. Armed with that research, we went back to Sydney and wrote the first draft. We knew we wanted it to be a musical with modern music in period settings, but how we would tell the story through music was something we had to discover. The way we discovered it was thorough looking at our Orphean character, Christian, played by Ewan McGregor. In the myth, Orpheus is allowed into Underworld due to power and beauty of his musical gift.">
