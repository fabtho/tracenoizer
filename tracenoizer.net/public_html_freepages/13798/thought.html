 We were conversing a bit about an upcoming trip we are taking to the oceanside. we were in a dreamlike state (napping there in the sun), and I started to verbalize my fantasy of being by the beach. I could see this romantic scene, but then I thought you were going to say, '. but I thought I'd send you this story, and between you two, with your sense of humor, I thought maybe you might want to use this story for a laugh.

 the challenge How to communicate values or parameters from the server to another page in a manner which didn't assume server-side processing beyond my control. That is, how to pass values back from the cgi in a form which something else could then do whatever they want with (including ignore). the solution Well, I thought, what if the redirection included the names of the missing fields in the URL itself, in the form of a searcharg parameter. Then, they could use a javascript on their html page to extract the names and display them however they wanted. Heck, they could even supply the URL for another cgi for the required-missing URL redirection, and thus trigger follow-on processing elsewhere.</td>

 People shouldn't open suspicious e-mail, no matter how tempting. . It never thought the two-by-four across the head would come from the love bug. On Thursday, the fastest-moving, hardest-hitting, most-widespread computer virus ever swept from Asia - possibly originating in the Philippines - across Europe and throughout North and South America as quickly as the morning sun moved around the globe. More than likely, it's still infecting computers today.</td>
