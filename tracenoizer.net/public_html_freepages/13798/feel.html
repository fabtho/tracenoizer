 I can hear you breathing inside of me, but I need a bit more from you. . F I can feel it slowly enveloping me, embracing me. I shudder as the warmth of your hand touches me, Gasping at the thoughts that want you to proceed. Never imagined that one touch could stir such heat Could daze my mind or even quicken my heart beat.</td>

 I also have some quotations about kissing that one might find interesting. As my HTML programming skills improve, I plan to include a few more pages and maybe do an occasional survey or contest (depending on the interest). If you think this is cool or have any questions or comments, feel free to e-mail me. Let us first begin with Webster's definitions of kiss. So maybe those defintions didn't come from a dictionary.</td>

 I've got a blur of New Mexican desert and sky, and the smell of some kind of auto fluid, and Shania Twain's childhood flashing in front of me. No, I guess it's not funn-- --flip-- --it was that magazine I was reading, back at the gas station, yeah that was it. You know how something creepy and sad and sick like that becomes a feel-good story. Because she made it and she's famous and she's got a husband and a big-ass house and about fifty million fucking dollars in the bank, that's why. I was just throwing the magazine down on the pile when the guy came back in to say he'd fixed the problem with the steering.</td>
