 He could buy 960 new cars every week for a century. He could make you a millionaire without realizing the money's missing. A million is a small part of a billion - one-thousandth of a billion, in fact. It's just one-hundredth of one-thousandth of Billy's fortune. Like you would if you dropped a quarter behind the couch.</td>

 Now all of us on Ultimate Steps are advertising your site and saying how wonderful it is (I think we deserve a thank you at least). I think the Wonky song lyrics are the best, and the defacing of the pictures, that's just inspirational. Also the fact that you took the time and effort to actually listen to Steps' songs and then re-write the lyrics so that fit in perfectly shows just how dedicated you are to the cause. I know you may hate the fact that we Steps fans all love your site, but it's tough - sorrryyy. Either this scary woman is being incredibly sarcastic, or the concept of dedication has gone completely out of the window.</td>

 My second attempt was also a bust, since it turned out I didn't have the software necessary to read the formatted file. Finally, on my third try, I succeeded and settled back to learn the fate of Carlos Detweiller, The Plant's psychotic protagonist. In fact, by late August, King had worked himself up into a right old snit and decided to double the price of subsequent chapters. Last March, King launched the e-book revolution when he invited readers to download his novella Riding the Bullet directly from the Internet. But just a few short months later, this populist hero who had accused publishers of caring only for their wallets was sounding a lot like the enemy himself.</td>
