 . They settled in Shrewsbury, New Jersey and raised seven children and had a positive impact on the lives of their grandchildren.

 . By SCOTT ROSENBERG Richard Thompson has been producing inspired albums with such consistency over the past decade that we are in a little danger of taking him for granted. Thompson has been a profoundly expressive guitarist, moody songwriter and grim wit from his days with the pioneering British folk-rock group Fairport Convention in the late '60s and early '70s; to his decade-long collaboration with ex-wife Linda, culminating in the classic "Shoot Out the Lights" (1982); to rewarding solo collections like "Across a Crowded Room" (1985), "Rumor and Sigh" (1991) and "Mirror Blue" (1994). ," features 19 tracks divided between two CDs, one acoustic and one electric. " It's a collection that will enchant the perpetually small cadre of Thompson devotees; it might even enlarge their ranks.</td>
