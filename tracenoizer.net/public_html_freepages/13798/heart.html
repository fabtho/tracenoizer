They went into the living room and sat down on an old couch with the foam and springs exposed. The young lad's heart began to be tenderized and at the end of the bus pastor's story the bus pastor asked if the boy wanted to receive this free gift from God. The little kid just sat there, clueless of what was going on. By this time the offering plate was being passed down his aisle and with a broken heart he just grabbed the plate and held on to it.">

 F I can feel it slowly enveloping me, embracing me. I shudder as the warmth of your hand touches me, Gasping at the thoughts that want you to proceed. Never imagined that one touch could stir such heat Could daze my mind or even quicken my heart beat. Eyes darkening with need, they pull me closer to you. How can I cease this madness, tell me, what can I do.</td>
