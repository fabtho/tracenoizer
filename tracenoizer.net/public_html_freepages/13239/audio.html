 Advances in scientific areas such as algorithmic and chaos driven approaches to sound composition have profoundly shifted the field of experimental sound art. Sampling and digital technology detonated the remix bomb, causing a fusion of styles, methods and origins. Audio in digital media contexts has become a field of unlimited transmutations and unheard potentials. Recent developments in the delivery of audio across the Internet have also lead to the mass distribution of music online. Though this has interrupted the stranglehold corporate culture has on the distribution of sound, it has also raised interesting questions about artistic ownership and copyright.</td>
