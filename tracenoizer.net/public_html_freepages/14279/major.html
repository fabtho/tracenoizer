 Donaldson Collection housed in the Department of Special Collections of the Kent State University Libraries. Donaldson started depositing his manuscripts at the university. The collection is quite comprehensive and the materials, in their literary significance, constitute a major resource for scholarly investigation. It is an important and growing collection which will provide an abundance of research material for students for years to come. The collection has been arranged and catalogued and is available for public use.</td>

 By providing methods of determining which problems are soluble, Kleene's work led to the study of which functions can be computed. From 1930's on Kleene more than any other mathematician developed the notions of computability and effective process in all their forms both abstract and concrete, both mathematical and philosophical. He tended to lay the foundations for an area and then move on to the next, as each successive one blossomed into a major research area in his wake. Kleene's best known books are Introduction to Metamathematics (1952) and Mathematical Logic (1967). .</td>
