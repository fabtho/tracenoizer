 7th Heaven still airs in syndication Monday through Friday in addition to its regular Monday night time slot. . Stephen was recently on Rosie and The View talking about the scientific research that shows how Transcendental Meditation (TM) can be a tool to stop violence and terrorism in the world. If you want to hear more about this amazing research, click here. (By the way, a few people who have heard Stephen talk about this seem to think that TM is a religion, but it's not.</td>

 Stephen Turner's Home Page Stephen Turner Work Until recently I was an academic, in the Statistical Laboratory, University of Cambridge. I've given it up now though, and I'm considering my next move. My research was on stochastic networks; that's to do with mathematical problems in communications networks. You can still get a list of my research publications. You can even download some of them, including my Ph.</td>
