 Donaldson started depositing his manuscripts at the university. The collection is quite comprehensive and the materials, in their literary significance, constitute a major resource for scholarly investigation. It is an important and growing collection which will provide an abundance of research material for students for years to come. The collection has been arranged and catalogued and is available for public use. It was processed for Web display by Kenton Daniels, January-March 1996.</td>
