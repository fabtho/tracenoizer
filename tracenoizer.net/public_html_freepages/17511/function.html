 These interfaces are used too for nonlinear systems software in SLICOT and will be developed as part of the NICONET project. 1 - Selection of Basic Software Tools for Standard and Generalized State-Space Systems and Transfer Matrix Factorizations. This paper discusses the algorithms and software for basis control problems, for the factorization of proper transfer function matrices, and for descriptor systems which are to be included in the SLICOT library. This task is executed as part of the NICONET project. 1 - Selection of Model Reduction Routines SLICOT Working Note 1998-2, June 1998.</td>
