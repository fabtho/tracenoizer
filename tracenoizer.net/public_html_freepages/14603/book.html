 This is one of those books that sticks with you --- a great wrenching cry of a book that changes the way you think about everything. . But his brother Mikal had almost nothing to do with that book. A few years ago, he wrote his own --- and it says more in a page than Mailer does in a hundred. This is the story of a father and a son, of a legacy of rage; it's also the story of brothers who, though equally haunted, took very different paths.</td>

 Here, in non-fiction form, Mailer finally delivers. . The Executioner's Song The Executioner's Song by Norman Mailer It took me longer to read The Executioner's Song than any previous Norman Mailer book. I think I was thrown by the paragraph formation (every paragraph is an entity unto itself), and the fact that, despite what I'd heard, I didn't find it. It doesn't compare with Truman Capote's In Cold Blood, for example, where we got into the heads of both killers and victims.</td>
