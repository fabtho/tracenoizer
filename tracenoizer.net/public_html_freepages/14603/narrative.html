 Matthew Barney Matthew Barney Born 1967, San Francisco, California, U. Lives and works in New York Cremaster 2 is part of a five-film series that has occupied Barney as writer, director, and actor since 1994. Although not one continuous narrative, the series revolves around issues of masculine prowess and transcendence. In each of the films, ritualized athletic endeavors and sexual transformations are emphasized. Episodes in the film present Harry Houdini (played by Mailer), reputed by family legend to be the illegitimate grandfather of Gilmore, as a perfect athlete capable of transcending physical limitations and escaping from any space.</td>

 (a) ALTERNATIVE - Alternative films extend current boundaries or conventions of expression and rely on unconventional aesthetic and technical elements. Films submitted in this category must meet the above guidelines, and must not be obvious candidates for any other category. (b) ANIMATION - Animated films may present an original narrative story, an existing story or fable, or an exploration of a mood or thought. Either comical or serious, they usually fall into one of two general fields -- character animation or abstract animation. Winning animation films are chosen by judging the product as a whole, as well as the artistic and technical skill of the animator in whatever motif or animation technique the student has chosen.</td>
