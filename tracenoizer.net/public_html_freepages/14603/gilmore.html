 Polish director Agnieszka Holland, working from a screenplay by Frank Pugliese, makes us understand how for one man embracing a firing squad was the closest thing to gaining his freedom. SHOT IN THE HEART article in The Detroit Free Press SHOT IN THE HEART article in SFGate. com Norman Mailer, Gary Gilmore, and the Untold Stories of the Law The Story of Gary Gilmore Should We Grieve for Gary Gilmore. - Opinion article Capital punishment In the United States - from Encyclopedia. com Exit - Gary Gilmore, article from Death Penalty News---UTAH Death Penalty Monolith Begins to Crack By Michael A.</td>

 . The story unfolds in a series of stunning and surreal scenes that are narratively obscure and visually persuasive. The scene immediately preceding when Gilmore murders the gas station attendant and thus begins his infamous killing spree, has him parked in a shiny Mustang that is seamlessly connected to another Mustang by a tunnel linking the two cars. The tightly-corseted grandmother of Gilmore conducts a seance with her son and his fiance in which Gilmore is conceived to the buzzing of thousands of bees. That Gilmore was the first person to be executed in the United Sates after the reinstitution of the death penalty also contributes to the complex martyrdom (political and moral) with which both Barney and Mailer surround his death.</td>

 I think I was thrown by the paragraph formation (every paragraph is an entity unto itself), and the fact that, despite what I'd heard, I didn't find it. It doesn't compare with Truman Capote's In Cold Blood, for example, where we got into the heads of both killers and victims. Here the focus is on Gary Gilmore and his lover Nicole. Something creepy genuinely occurs when the victims appear--the roundabout way their lives intersect with Gary Gilmore's--but just as quickly they are gone and the focus becomes Gilmore once again. It's as if the claims that, in the media glare surrounding the execution of Gary Gilmore, the victims were forgotten apply to this book as well.</td>

 . Without that kind of coaching the film, while stunning to look at, defies narrative interpretation. For those who don't remember, Gary Gilmore was executed in 1976 for murdering two men on two consecutive nights. The case made history because it was the first execution in this country in ten years. More importantly, Gilmore refused the appeals process, demanding the right to die -- "blood atonement" in Morman doctrine -- for his sins.</td>
