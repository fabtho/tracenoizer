 . FOCUS started 17 years ago when a small group of overseas and Australian students gathered together to study the Bible. We meet on Fridays and Sundays to study God's Word in large meetings and smaller groups, to have fellowship together as a church, and to build each other up in the hope we all share. We will be looking at the idea of Jesus' Resurrection from the dead, where does it fit into God's plan, and how does that impact us. This year will be on Monday 22 July to Friday 26 July at Merroo Conference Centre.</td>

 Over the holidays and half-terms, they run fun weeks, which are three-day programmes for children aged five to 16. As many as 200 children attend each of these courses, where children of all levels of talent are welcome. The children are split into age groups and work with qualified and assistant coaches. The youngsters have the chance to meet the Swindon players and have question-and-answer sessions with them. We help improve their technical ability and their skills.</td>
