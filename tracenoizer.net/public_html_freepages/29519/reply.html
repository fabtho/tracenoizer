 Example of META A typical use of the META element is to embed expiration date dates for documents. This will avoid any caching of a document past the specified date. In addition, you can use META tags to insert reply-to information (an e-mail address for the person responsible for the document). An interesting use is to specify an auto-refresh setting that will force the browser to reload the contents of the document every so often or to load an entirely different document, as with a client-pull. Another frequent use is to imbed keywords that indexing robots will use to classify your document.</td>
