 A client-side image map specifies a set of regions on an image that can be used as hyperlinks by clicking on them. The advantage of client-side image maps is that they take map processing loads from the server, as well as activate additional visual cues on the user's browser regarding "hot spots" in the images. The MARQUEE element provides many options to control the behavior of the MARQUEE and provides an interesting way of adding text animation without increasing download requirements. The default value is LEFT (text starts scrolling from the right). A setting of -1 or INFINITE will loop the text while the page remains on the screen.</td>
