 This information is only usable by the browser and other programs. For example, browsers render the title of your document based on a TITLE element inside the HEAD section. The simplest HTML page you could write that does something useful is HelloWorld. It sets up the basic structure of the document and uses the TITLE element in the HEAD section. The TITLE element titles the document, and the browser uses this information to put a title in the windows title bar.</td>
