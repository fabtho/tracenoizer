 All PSP projects in these organizations were delivered on or ahead of schedule and only one has had any customer-reported defects. The effective use of PSP depends on proper training, but with the training and continuing management interest, the authors conclude that PSP is an effective methodology for efficiently developing quality software. The full text of Computer is available to members of the IEEE Computer Society who have an online subscription and a web account. ..</td>

 Departments will continue to surplus laptops and non Intel based systems when appropriate. . This process, based on the Computer Workstation Acquisition and Upgrade Plan, enables participating departments to increase their purchasing power for computers by pooling funds with other departments to allow mass purchases of computers by the Microcomputer Maintenance Shop. Examples of classes of computers, their use, and their acquisition cost are shown in Table I. The class of a computer is based on the applications that a faculty or staff member intends to use.</td>

 Repair and Calibration Training These programs are designed to provide information necessary to perform instruments' required calibrations, as well as troubleshooting and repairs of instruments or systems. Seminars vary from one day to five days, depending on the prior experience of the trainee, English language skills, etc. Students must be skilled electronics technicians, with analog, digital, and personal computer experience. The requirement for prior application training may be waived, if the International Field Service Coordinator can schedule application training during the same seminar. Repair and calibration training for certain high-performance instruments is only available to PMS and PMS International Distributors' field service personnel.</td>
