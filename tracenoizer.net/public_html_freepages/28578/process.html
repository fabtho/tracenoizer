<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" Pryor's Development System - Mind and Memory - Fabulous Visual Images Beyond the Doors The mind processes visual imagery on both conscious and subconscious levels. The eyes take in so much detail that the subconscious mind must filter it before encoding for memory. In the process of forming a memory, each mind spontaneously draws upon the subconscious or fabulous mental legacy of its cultural past to interact with new detail and produce unique resonances of meaning. Although these mental processes are spontaneous and inescapable, many would ignore or deny all such subconscious resonances and images. But those seeking to realize their whole mind potential for living and learning must not avoid the subconscious mind or the differences in right and left brain functions.">

 Departments will continue to surplus laptops and non Intel based systems when appropriate. . This process, based on the Computer Workstation Acquisition and Upgrade Plan, enables participating departments to increase their purchasing power for computers by pooling funds with other departments to allow mass purchases of computers by the Microcomputer Maintenance Shop. Examples of classes of computers, their use, and their acquisition cost are shown in Table I. The class of a computer is based on the applications that a faculty or staff member intends to use.</td>
