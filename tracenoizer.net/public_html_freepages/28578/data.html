 And too often, they follow inefficient methods and procedures. The Personal Software Process is a methodology that helps software engineers plan and track their work. Because PSP was only experimentally introduced in 1994 and has been undergoing further development, relatively little data on its use and effectiveness has been available. Application areas included commercial data processing, internal manufacturing support, communications product support, and real-time process control. All PSP projects in these organizations were delivered on or ahead of schedule and only one has had any customer-reported defects.</td>

 We have found that an SSH1 RSA key is implemented with minimum efforts. Technical Support Technical support for configuring, testing, and porting is the users responsibility. Backup and recovery of your data is also the users responsibility. Porting Hints and Tips Registration To register for the LCDS, you must read and agree to the terms and conditions, and then fill out a registration form. If you have already registered for the Linux Community Development System, but have not received a response from us, it is possible that your e-mail address was invalid.</td>

 In this way the effective viscosity of the suspension will be determined and the effects of nearby surfaces near which particles can form colloidal crystals will be studied, resolving a long standing problem of importance in engineering applications. Our studies of nonlinear propagation, deterministic chaos, and pattern formation in lasers are well known internationally, and unique in Australia and have resulted in 17 publications. Our optically pumped far-infrared NH3 laser exhibits Lorenz-like chaos, and produces some of the best chaotic data available, allowing in depth testing of theory and analysis methods. Our work is currently focussed on the effects of sudden parameter changes in chaotic systems and on means of controlling chaos by feedback. We are extending our work to the interactions of chaotic systems, such as synchronisation which has been proposed as the basis for secure communications.</td>
