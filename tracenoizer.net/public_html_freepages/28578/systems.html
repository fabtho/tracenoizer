<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" The worksheet includes a listing of all computers currently on the department's inventory. This information -- what the user HAS and what the user NEEDS -- assists the account authority to (1) project the total cost of upgrading (and replacing, as necessary) the department's computers on a yearly basis, and to (2) request the appropriate funds during the regular university budget process. The plan assumes that upgrades of existing Intel-based systems would be scheduled on a staggered four-year cycle. Ideally, only one-fourth of a department's workstations will need to be replaced each year, so the cost of keeping all computers up to date will remain fairly constant. Table II is an example of the cost of upgrades for an Intel-based basic workstation.">

 Hardware Configuration Software Configuration Linux Guests User Requirements Technical Support Porting Hints and Tips Registration Hardware Configuration LCDS System 9672 G6 Model ZX7 (10 way processor) Memory 32GB DASD Shark 2105-F20 (2. 1 terabytes) Network The network configuration is a direct Internet connection with open access to the Linux guest machines from the WWW. Software Configuration The LCDS mainframe is supported by an IBM Virtual Machine, established to support a large number of guest systems. With registration approval, you are given access to a guest system to accommodate your Linux project. We have found that an SSH1 RSA key is implemented with minimum efforts.</td>

 Our studies of nonlinear propagation, deterministic chaos, and pattern formation in lasers are well known internationally, and unique in Australia and have resulted in 17 publications. Our optically pumped far-infrared NH3 laser exhibits Lorenz-like chaos, and produces some of the best chaotic data available, allowing in depth testing of theory and analysis methods. Our work is currently focussed on the effects of sudden parameter changes in chaotic systems and on means of controlling chaos by feedback. We are extending our work to the interactions of chaotic systems, such as synchronisation which has been proposed as the basis for secure communications. Other concerns are the interrelationship between chaotic and stochastic effects in real nonlinear systems.</td>
