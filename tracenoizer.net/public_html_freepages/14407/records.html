 Flying Records also has a branch in Newcastle run in association with Forensic Records and Shindig, one of the most successful nights in the country. . Flying Records was an extension of the infamous club nights put on up and down the country at Soho Theatre Dingwalls (Camden) and Venus (Nottingham) to name a few. As well as promoting some of the best club nights in the UK, Flying also organised club trips to Ibiza in 1989 and 1990 and moving on to Rimini, Italy, in 1991. Which was remixed by Boys Own Production team Terry Farley and Pete Heller.</td>

 South Australia's State Archives Department, established in 1919, was the first State Archives in Australia, and an early leader in the preservation of the corporate memory of an Australian State. Originally located in the old Armory Building of the Mounted Police Barracks at the rear of the Art Gallery, the South Australian Archives opened its doors to researchers in 1920. Holdings included both government and private records. Legislation enacted in 1925 prohibited the destruction of Government records without the approval of the Libraries Board of South Australia, and empowered the Board to take records into its custody. The legislation also provided for the recovery of government documents in the hands of 'unauthorised persons'.</td>

 In the early days of Odd Fellowship in the United States, lodge membership in lodges of The Independent Order of Odd Fellows was limited to white men (membership is now open to men and women of all races). Black men joined Odd Fellow Lodges that were chartered by The Grand United Order of Odd Fellows. Each Grand Lodge and Rebekah Assembly keeps the annual reports from all of the lodges under its jurisdiction, for as far back as the records survive. The annual report lists the current members and dates of membership change, such as when a member joined the lodge (by initiation or transfer from another lodge) and when a member leaves the lodge (by death, resignation, or transfer to another lodge). Details, such as what lodge the member transferred to or from, are in lodge records.</td>
