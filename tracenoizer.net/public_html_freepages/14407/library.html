 OUR PURPOSE The Society (SCGS) The Southern California Genealogical Society was organized January 10, 1964 to foster interest in genealogy, preserve genealogical materials, and train researchers in effective and accurate techniques. Through its programs, the member is offered the opportunity to list queries, survey indexes, join special interest groups and provide support for other members and their activities. A 30,000 volume library of books, periodicals and electronic data is maintained for the patron's use. A master listing of events is available on-line covering the many activities of the society. An on-line store is available for ordering of a multitude of genealogical books and equipment.</td>
