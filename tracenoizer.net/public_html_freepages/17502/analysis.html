 The most straightforward way of computing distances between objects in a multi-dimensional space is to compute Euclidean distances. If we had a two- or three-dimensional space this measure is the actual geometric distance between objects in the space (i. The Cluster Analysis module will compute various types of distance measures, or the user can compute a matrix of distances him or herself and directly use it in the procedure.

 This rule produces "stringy" types of clusters, that is, clusters "chained together" by only single objects that happen to be close together. Alternatively, we may use the neighbors across clusters that are furthest away from each other; this method is called complete linkage. There are numerous other linkage rules such as these that have been proposed, and the Cluster Analysis module offers a wide choice of them.
