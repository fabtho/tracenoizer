 Equally as speculative is a nonvolatile memory being studied as a replacement for flash. The ovonics unified memory uses a polycrystalline chalcogenide layer to retain impressions (or bits) burned in by a resistive heater element, said Stefan Lai, vice president and co-director of Intel's California Technology and Manufacturing group. The chalcogenic layer combines germanium, antimony and tellurium, allowing memory impressions can be rewritten several thousand times. Intel had reported on these experiments at IEDM in December. The current ISSCC presentation reports on attempts to build a 4-Mbit memory device with the new memory technology.</td>
