 This is one of 1997's finest motion pictures, and is a forceful reminder that Hollywood is still capable of making magic. . Contact is that rare big-budget motion picture that places ideas, characters, and plot above everything else. The film takes the richness of astronomer Carl Sagan's bestselling 1985 novel and re-invents it for the screen, retaining all the power and fascination of the book while adding a visual aspect that will not disappoint devoted fans. Contact is as close as recent Hollywood productions have come to a perfect example of cinema.</td>
