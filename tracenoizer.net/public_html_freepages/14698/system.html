 Back Orifice, however, is designed to be stealthy and evade detection by the user. The creation and distribution of viruses is against the law. Typically, a Trojan horse requires a user to take some kind of action to install or run it on the system. Back Orifice falls into that category because it is intentionally designed to hide itself from detection. The creators claim that this is a useful administration tool, but it doesn't even prompt people when it installs itself on the system.</td>

 There is a wide variety of software available, and I outline a good number of sources on these pages, with annotation. My effort is meant to be in a spirit of information-sharing. I am not trying to promote any particular system, just outline what is available. What I suggest is people check out what is offered to see how it serves their needs, hardware, and pocketbooks. I might be able to answer questions if you respond directly.</td>
