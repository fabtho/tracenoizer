 On January 10th, the twins turned five years old, celebrating with a memorable trip to Disneyland. Eric and Brandon also like the fact that at the grown-up age of five they get to stay up late and don't have to take naps. When not acting, the boys like to play on their trampoline and with their dog, Zack, and a cat named Kitty. They love to go camping and fishing, and play all sports. Eric and Brandon's favorite snack is pickles and beef jerky.</td>

 For additional info on Brandon and Eric, see their Fascinating Facts section. This picture was taken one year before the boys started on DAYS. When not acting, the boys like to play on their trampoline and with their dog, Zack, and their cat named Kitty. They love to go camping and fishing, and play all sports. Eric and Brandon's first acting role was on The Young and the Restless on May 31, 1994.</td>

 Belle told John and Marlena that Brady was away at baseball camp. During Christmas 1999 when the Bradys and Blacks gathered at the Brady Pub, Marlena said that Brady was home sick. He wasn't healthy enough to be with his family, but he was healthy enough to play video games instead of studying (in her words). In February 1999, Brady was again mentioned and it sounded as if he was living in Marlena's penthouse, although we still hadn't seen him. To start with, Brady's missed his dad's "sub sex" saga.</td>
