 They have had great fun with the part and their involvement with the cast. On January 10th, the twins turned five years old, celebrating with a memorable trip to Disneyland. Eric and Brandon also like the fact that at the grown-up age of five they get to stay up late and don't have to take naps. When not acting, the boys like to play on their trampoline and with their dog, Zack, and a cat named Kitty. They love to go camping and fishing, and play all sports.</td>
