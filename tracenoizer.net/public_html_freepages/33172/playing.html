 I currently attend Pace University NY and major in Computer Information Systems. I'm also a music director and DJ at WRPW Pace college radio, soon to be one of the major players in college radio with help from tons of great people. Hobbies include playing guitar, waterskiing, baseball, and listening to an assload of music. Favorite genre is metal, and if I listed all of my favorite bands, I would need 3 separate pages. You can never have enough music, and you can never have enough GOOD music.</td>

 MRA beat Magnolia Heights 36-14 on the road in the third game of the season. Coach Skip Moore said, however, the game was much closer than the score might have indicated, and he expects a difficult championship game. "They're playing as well as anybody in the state right now," he said. However, the Patriots lost their final four regular-season games. They played four consecutive ranked teams, all close, and played without one of their top players, junior receiver Phillip Harrison.</td>
