 The Center coordinates and conducts extensive research related to the global water cycle, the biogeochemical cycles, Earth System history, and human impacts on the Earth system. Faculty and students cooperate closely in the planning and the execution of research projects, share expertise and insight into research problems, and work together on education and outreach programs. Since its creation in 1985, the Center has played a leading role in the early development of Earth system science as an academic discipline. ..</td>

 STC for Graphics and Visualization Brown University is part of the NSF Science and Technology Center (STC) for Graphics and Visualization . NSF ITR Awards The NSF awarded ITR (Information Technology Research) grants to David Laidlaw, in collaboration with Michael J. Our most recent user-interface project with NASA is the development of a stand-alone library for creating and interacting with 3D widgets. He then went on to mentor students who have since, under his direction, created much of the graphics material on the website. The awards ceremony was held in Italy and was attended by the Italian Prime Minister and the President of Pirelli Corporation International as well as the British Ambassador to Italy.</td>

 Coombs Computing, as part of its commitment to this process, is cooperating with the Government of Vietnam initiative on Information Technology and Vietnam's Institute for Information Technology. The Australia Vietnam Science-Technology Link is particularly interested in the environment and appropriate technology. We assist Vietnamese scientists find their own solutions to development problems. We are also concerned with the enormous task of saving Vietnam's environment. We know that conservation is not fencing in forests or jailing poachers.</td>
