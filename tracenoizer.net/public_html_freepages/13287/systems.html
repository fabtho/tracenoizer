 Concurrent with the development of this sensor technology has been a National Science Foundation-funded education initiative to provide college and high school students with skills needed to resolve today's environmental problems. Near-real time data profiles on lake temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration, conductivity, turbidity and pH will be transmitted to an Internet-linked base station. Data will be incorporated into database management, geographic information, simulation modeling and data visualization systems, with well-documented educational materials. This synthesized information will be available through an Internet web site and through touchscreen information kiosks deployed in high visibility areas. A series of workshops will be conducted to maximize public awareness and access to this system.</td>

 At the regional level, ICS-FORTH is contributing to developments in the context of international collaborative activities and, in particular programmes addressing the South-East Mediterranean area and collaborates closely with local authorities and other organisations. The laboratories of ICS-FORTH are interconnected through high speed (FDDI) Local Area Networks (LAN) and have access to INTERNET and other international computer networks. FORTHnet interconnects many local area networks and private computer systems throughout Greece and provides access to INTERNET. In this context, ICS-FORTH represents Greece in the European Research Consortium for Informatics and Mathematics (ERCIM), an organisation dedicated to the advancement of European research and development, in the areas of information technology and applied mathematics. Fourteen European countries are currently participating in ERCIM.</td>
