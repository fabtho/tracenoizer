 In our effort to help you save money, Brides' Village offers "coupons" in the form of a coupon code which can be entered onto your order form during the checkout process. These coupons are found in our various advertising means, such as magazines, links in search engines, specials for those in our customer database who have asked to be notified of promotions; we also periodically post coupons on our homepage. Percent-off coupons can never be applied to shipping or tax; only the product total. Please be sure to make note of the coupon's expiration date; our Yahoo. Shopping System does not allow coupons to be redeemed after they expire.</td>
