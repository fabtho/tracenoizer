 According to test givers, an eighth-grade child at the basic level is supposed to identify the basics of how American democracy works and know that the ideas come from the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. The 12th graders should show they can understand - as well as identify - those fundamentals. Younger children, 4th graders, were asked more rudimentary questions such as why we have laws and what happens when people break them. Like the high school seniors, about one-third of fourth graders and eighth graders performed below basic levels, meaning there are serious gaps in their knowledge and abilities. Among the test findings were that fewer than half of 12th graders knew the president and the State Department have more authority over foreign policy than Congress or the courts; 36 percent knew the Supreme Court used the Constitution's 14th Amendment to invalidate state laws that segregate public schools; only 9 percent could list two ways democratic society benefits from the active participation of its citizens.</td>
