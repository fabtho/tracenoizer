 -------- Students Lag in Civics Knowledge By ANJETTA McQUEEN . c The Associated Press WASHINGTON (AP) - Two-thirds of high school seniors - many old enough to vote in next year's elections - have a basic understanding of how American government works, but more may lack the civics education to cast informed votes, a survey suggests. The results of the 1998 national test of government and civics education show that just 26 percent of 12th graders scored well enough to demonstrate a good understanding of how governments work and the ability to apply what they have learned to concrete situations. '' Education Secretary Richard Riley said Thursday results could improve as more schools focus on civics instruction and special projects such as field trips to city council meetings. The test, called the National Assessment of Educational Progress, is administered by a nationwide group established by Congress.</td>
