 AEDs are easy-to-use, portable devices that deliver a potentially lifesaving electric shock to the heart, which can restore a heart's normal rhythm in the event of sudden cardiac arrest. Immediate use of an AED, in conjunction with CPR, could save up to 50,000 lives a year. Project Lifesaver is designed to help communities plan and implement access to defibrillation programs by providing AED education, training, support for state and federal AED legislation, as well as urging communities to obtain AEDs. The American Red Cross envisions every American being within four minutes of an AED and someone trained to use it in the event of sudden cardiac arrest. To make this possible, the American Red Cross is bringing life-saving AED training to communities and companies like yours.</td>

 Three systems will meet most of these needs at varying levels. All offer considerable flexibility, customization, and resources for questionnaire development and reporting functions. While participants spend part of their training on system administration, they primarily focus on writing good questionnaire items and piloting procedures. The software also contains an expansive library of pretested questions. Both training and library items are included in the base price.</td>
