 SADC Forestry Sector Technical Co-ordination Unit Malawi Institute of Management, Report on SADC Workshop on Establishment of Forestry Information Network. .

The issues under discussion range from specific questions such as the development of standards for data capture to more general questions on the role developing a national policy for linking development and environment.
