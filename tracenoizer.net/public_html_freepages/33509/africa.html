 The new governor Friedrich Lindequist (1805) supported the interests of the Settlers. General Lothar of Trotha, commander-in-chief of the German force, led the expedition corps to the suppression of the rebellion. Trotha had already gained experience in colonial conflicts and distinguished himself with extraordinary brutality in East Africa and China. The Herero were encircled on the so-called Waterberg by the forces and driven afterwards to the desert where most of them died. Trotha then gave the order, to kill all Herero, also women and children.</td>

 It should be noted, however, that these demands were motivated by reference to the teachings of the deceased Kaptein Hendrik Witbooi. The South African administration was far from acceding to such ideas. In reality, its agenda included securing Namibia for South Africa, mainly as a field of white settlement (cf. Consequently, white settlement was intensified, in particular in southern Namibia, including the areas considered as traditional Witbooi territory which was considered prime farming country at the time and became the centre of the karakul industry during the 1920s and 1930s. For similar reasons as the last mentioned, pressure was also exerted by the resident Rhenish missionary.</td>
