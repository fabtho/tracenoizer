 Trotha then gave the order, to kill all Herero, also women and children. Trotha was recalled 1905 because of his unpopular methods. The Nama lived in the south of the Colony which was less affected by the German expansion, however, had participated in the rebellion also. They kept the resistance upright under the leadership of Hendrik Witbooi and later Jacob Morenga to 1907. .</td>

 This involved also work on remembrance and tradition, with the towering figure of the old Kaptein Hendrik Witbooi at the centre as a kind of linchpin of collective identity. The Witbooi had been amongst the Nama groups which were hit hardest by repression and deportation after the great rising had been suppressed. Only after the advent of the South African army were the Witbooi able to return to the region of Gibeon in any relevant numbers and almost immediately, started a sustained campaign for reconstituting some kind of communal nexus and government. This drive was centred around a programme of territorial demands which were put, largely unsuccessfully, to the South African authorities. It should be noted, however, that these demands were motivated by reference to the teachings of the deceased Kaptein Hendrik Witbooi.</td>

 This sentence to strict scholarly isolation did little to reform Boli, and he returned to Windhoek some years later to attend Jacob Morenga school. "I didn't complete matric - I got bored with school," Boli explains with little sign of regret. In 1988 - the year of the student uprising and the death throes of South African colonial rule - Boli joined the Bricks community project in Katutura, which at the time was probably the nearest thing Namibia had to a centre for liberation culture. It was while acting in a Bricks drama production called 'Boli' that Mootseng got the nick-name which has stuck with him ever since. In 1990 he left for Johannesburg to attend drama college, returning home two years later where he connected with the NBC, and co-presented the youth television programme 'Cool Running' with fellow cultural afficionado Lazarus Jacobs.</td>
