 This sentence to strict scholarly isolation did little to reform Boli, and he returned to Windhoek some years later to attend Jacob Morenga school. "I didn't complete matric - I got bored with school," Boli explains with little sign of regret. In 1988 - the year of the student uprising and the death throes of South African colonial rule - Boli joined the Bricks community project in Katutura, which at the time was probably the nearest thing Namibia had to a centre for liberation culture. It was while acting in a Bricks drama production called 'Boli' that Mootseng got the nick-name which has stuck with him ever since. In 1990 he left for Johannesburg to attend drama college, returning home two years later where he connected with the NBC, and co-presented the youth television programme 'Cool Running' with fellow cultural afficionado Lazarus Jacobs.</td>
