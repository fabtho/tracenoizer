Players get money for blowing up the bombs and all the players try to gain more money than they started with to win the game. On every turn you will buy Cows and pay for special effects by putting money into the Pot, then try to discover bombs with your own Cows in an effort to take money out of the Pot.</td>

All you have to do to come back is whenever you beat the Cow Level just save and exit, when you load your game again just go back to Tristam, get Wirt's Leg from his body, buy a Tome of Town Portal and Transmute them and another portal to the Cow Level appears. Use this process to play the Secret Cow Level as many times as you want. However if you do not kill the Cow King, you can keep going there and get lots of items and gold.</td>
