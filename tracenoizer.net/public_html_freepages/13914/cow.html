 COW page Finally, we have a small cow page which is linked off of the CMU Pugwash page maintained by Franklin Chang. . Here are all the other web cow pages I could find, loosely ordered by nothing in particular. ) Opt's page is first for historical reasons, then new pages, then the rest. I had thought about ordering them in descending order of cow content (most at the top; least at the bottom), but I haven't gotten around to it yet.</td>

 Given the date it was posted, it was taken to be a joke. .After all, what's a Secret Cow Level without some laughs. Expansion ChangesVery few things changed for the Expansion. So once you beat Baal in Normal Difficulty in the Expansion, create a normal-difficulty game, go back to Act One (use the waypoint to move between acts) and you can open up the Cow Level portal.</td>
