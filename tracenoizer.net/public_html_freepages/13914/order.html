As for WCIII, Dark and I will continue to work on and play for the CS divsion even after it is released. Both of us are fed up with blizzard games and feel the clan needs steps forward in order to avoid the problems we had with Brood War. I'm not saying this clan will not play WCIII, all i'm saying is that it will not be the main game our clan plays. The main game as it stands and will stand is Half-Life.">

 The Elephant has no symbol;to attach a Holy Symbol to the Elephant is to name Him, and we believe that this is an impossible task. His symbol is the Holy Bagpipes, and the Holy Sound which they give us. In order to worship them, it is necessary to spread their Holy Message as much as is possible. We began this website in an effort to acccomplish this task. com-Contact us with comments, questions, suggestions, or whatever.</td>

 Reproduction in whole or in part in any form or medium without express written permission of Ziff Davis Media is strictly prohibited . . In order to access the secret cow level, you'll need the horadric cube (found in Act 2), a tome of town portal (purchasable at vendors) and Wirt's leg. To find Wirt's leg, return to act 1 and take the red portal in the Stoney Field that leads back to Tristam (where Deckard Cain was found). Somewhere along the west edge of Tristam (next to the wall) you'll find the body of Wirt (the gimpy kid from the original Diablo).</td>
