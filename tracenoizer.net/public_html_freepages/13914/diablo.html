 . Well, the cows haven't forgotten about it, and they want revenge. After you have defeated Diablo (or Baal, if you're playing the expansion), start a new game, in the same difficulty level that you just completed. if you just killed Diablo in a Normal game, start a Normal game. if you just killed him in a nightmare game, start a nightmare game.</td>
