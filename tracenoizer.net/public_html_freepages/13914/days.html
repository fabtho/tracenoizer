<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" I wrote this page because there is so little information out there for women who work and breastfeed. Most of the support people in LaLeche are stay-at-home moms. They are very helpful in the initial days and as support for long-term breastfeeders, but for working moms, they can only give you theory. I hope that if there are LaLeche leaders out there who have experience working outside of the home while breastfeeding, that they can contact me and help me build this page. In the mean time, I am looking for information from anyone who works outside the home and breastfeeds (or has in the past).">

 It is called the "The Wired Professor - A guide to incorporating the world wide web in college instruction" by Anne Keating and Joseph Hargitai. K35 (1999) Besides having a nice format for the layout of the book, it seemed to be a rather easy-to-read introductory sort of book about the subject of integrating web resources. Like many publications these days it has a number of screen shots of both resources produced by the author as well as those available online. Additionally, the reference list is rich in online resources - that alone may be worth a glance. .</td>

 Cow Foods and Nutrition Bovines are known to naturally consume a lot of vegetation with a majority of their intake comprising of grass. Natural Defenses Through the conversion of essential elements such as iron, sulfur and other materials through their complex system of multiple stomachs and advanced glands, cows are capable of producing a wide range of artillery on short notice to defend themselves both in the wild by themselves and in groups overseen by cow generals. This is a very rare photo of the cow king in his early days at the bovine war academy on Planet Lactose. ..</td>

 Recent work from the University of Illinois (3) assists in quantifying this point. This study examined the relationships between disorders, dry matter intake and milk production. In this study, 48 cows in the university herd were monitored for the first 20 days of lactation. Average daily milk production for this 20 day period was 65 lbs. Twenty-four cows had at least one of the listed events during this period.</td>
