 Mad Dog welcome you to the first home page for The Holy Church of Moo. MOOISM is the world's oldest religion and has attended to the spiritual needs of animals since life first began on this green earth. In a last ditch effort to save the dying earth and all living things the doctrine of MOOISM is being transmitted to humans in hopes that their manipulative ways will cease. The only requirement for membership in The Holy Church of Moo is your renunciation of the belief that man is the most intelligent animal on the planet. All current man-made religions continue to deceive us about the true nature of life because they don't know any better.</td>
