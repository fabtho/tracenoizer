 No BST or other chemicals are ever used and the high butterfat content of the milk from these pampered cows ensures a rich, smooth cheese - handmade and comparable to France's best. . The cows are fed only fresh hay, grain, and pasturage; spend time outside every day; and each has her own pen personalized with her name and age.

 Copyright 1997 by Hugh Holub Back to the Rants Index Back to the Bandersnatch . . Bad Cow Public Relations BAD COW PUBLIC RELATIONS Arizona, like most of the western United States, has an antiquated set of laws that provide that cows must be fenced out, not fenced in. Back in the 1890's when the west was mostly unsettled, it probably made sense for ranchers to not have to pay a lot of money building fences to keep the cows on their land. And with so much public land around, or neighbors' land, it also made good economic sense to let your cows wander about eating someone else's grass.</td>

 Cow level statistics Curious as to what this level really had to offer, i decided to compile some statistics. Yeah i know i should get a life but i really love the way they go "moo moo moo. The 2 unique cows were no longer there but were replaced by 4 hell bovine champions. The cow king was still there, same as ever with his pitiful lightning enchantment only. I also picked up a chipped sapphire and 3 chipped emeralds.</td>
