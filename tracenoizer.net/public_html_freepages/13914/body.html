 In order to access the secret cow level, you'll need the horadric cube (found in Act 2), a tome of town portal (purchasable at vendors) and Wirt's leg. To find Wirt's leg, return to act 1 and take the red portal in the Stoney Field that leads back to Tristam (where Deckard Cain was found). Somewhere along the west edge of Tristam (next to the wall) you'll find the body of Wirt (the gimpy kid from the original Diablo). Click on his body and he'll drop quite a bit of gold as well as "Wirt's Leg". Once you've gotten his leg, return to the Rogue Encampment.</td>

In addition, delayed skeletal maturity resulting from underfeeding can result in decreased pelvic width (and overall area) and increased calving difficulty. Due to the differences in size and body composition existing both between and within beef breeds, it is difficult to provide exact recommendations for feeding levels for growing heifers. In general, however, feeding to maintain an average daily gain of 1. A caution must be made concerning overfeeding heifers.</td>
