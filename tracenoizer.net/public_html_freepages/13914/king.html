 Every cow looks the same, there is no variation in coloration or weaponry at all. The level is all on the surface, there aren't any sub levels or dungeon or cave areas, but there is a main wooden stockade sort of area, with walls just like those in the Rogue Encampment. Multiple VisitsYou can open the red portal to the cow level as many times as you like, providing you don't get credit for killing the king. Read this portion of our MF Javazon Guide for more details. Are in the Cow Level, when some other player who has never killed the king before (on that difficulty level) kills the Cow King.</td>

 Yeah i know i should get a life but i really love the way they go "moo moo moo. The 2 unique cows were no longer there but were replaced by 4 hell bovine champions. The cow king was still there, same as ever with his pitiful lightning enchantment only. I also picked up a chipped sapphire and 3 chipped emeralds. Lastly, since i really wanted to know just how many cows there were, i recorded my xp b4 and after the whole thing and found out that i had gained 41117xp which indicated around 500 cows including the special ones.</td>

 Place a Tome of Town Portal, and Wirt's PegLeg (you should have picked it up when you were in Tristram, rescuing Cain. A portal will be opened, which will lead you to the Cow level. If you can manage to avoid killing the Cow King, you will be able to repeat the level. They're Hell Bovines, with Polearms, and they aren't exactly happy to see you. It isn't a very large area, but there are an incredible number of cows in it.</td>
