 All you have to do to come back is whenever you beat the Cow Level just save and exit, when you load your game again just go back to Tristam, get Wirt's Leg from his body, buy a Tome of Town Portal and Transmute them and another portal to the Cow Level appears. Use this process to play the Secret Cow Level as many times as you want. However if you do not kill the Cow King, you can keep going there and get lots of items and gold. If you see a non-working or fake code in the list above, let us know by using the Bad Code Notification Form. You can submit your own codes or secrets for this game using the Code Submission Form.</td>

 but i have beaten the single player on all the difficulties 'cept Hell. may not be the best tho but its free and free stuff is hard to come by most of the time. GOOD STUFF ON EAST FOR ALL LEVELS A bullet in the head doesn't always kill. thats why you put two in there for good measure or maybe just a good shotgun. .</td>
