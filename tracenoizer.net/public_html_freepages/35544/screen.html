 Finally they came for the first amendment, and by then it was too late to say anything at all. . No, you do NOT need mipmaps for quads to the screen in projection mode. The frame buffer lives in video memory, on the video card. OpenGL provides calls to read from and write to the frame buffer, but it is slow, and thus not really useful for this.</td>

 But when I want to animate a bitmap of let's say 640x480 in real time, I find it's too slow because I have to call gluBuild2DMipmaps every frame. I would like to access the bitmap memory of the OpenGL surface directly. I can see the picture on the screen, so it must be somewhere in the memory. ..</td>
