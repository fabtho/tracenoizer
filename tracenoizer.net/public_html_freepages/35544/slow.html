 No, you do NOT need mipmaps for quads to the screen in projection mode. The frame buffer lives in video memory, on the video card. OpenGL provides calls to read from and write to the frame buffer, but it is slow, and thus not really useful for this. Then they came for the sixth amendment, but I kept quiet because I wasn't guilty. Finally they came for the first amendment, and by then it was too late to say anything at all.</td>
