 I can see the picture on the screen, so it must be somewhere in the memory. . Is there a feasible way to blit to an OpenGL surface. a background picture) or reasonably small animated textures. But when I want to animate a bitmap of let's say 640x480 in real time, I find it's too slow because I have to call gluBuild2DMipmaps every frame.</td>
