<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" You may not know all of the answers, but by asking the questions, you show that you understand the business of practicing law. You also make it much easier for your marketing director to make apples-to-apples comparisons with several other potential marketing activities. You preach to your clients to involve you in important deals or litigation as early in the process as possible. Also, when you receive a request for proposal, make sure the marketing department knows about it and has a copy well in advance of the due date for your response. If you schedule an important meeting with a prospective client, your next call should be to your marketing director, who can help you research the company and prepare for the meeting.">

 "Our relationship with AccuData and AccuLeads is obviously very important, because it is one of our largest customers, but the focus of what it sells and what we sell is very different," she said. " "We know what the challenges were-how to maintain the immense files, the dynamics of exchanging the information, mounting the database on the web-and we used that learning curve to the benefit of our Alvion Technologies customers," Lang said. Internal Efficiency One of the original goals of Alvion's technology was to increase internal efficiency at AccuData by automating the list count and order process, she said. "But as the Internet has evolved with its e-commerce channels specifically in the business-to-business marketplace, more list or data brokers are looking to provide their customers a self-service count and or order process so their sales people can spend more time making better recommendations to clients. " List Automation For those companies that just want to automate their internal list count and order processes, but do not want e-commerce on their web sites, Alvion Technologies also offers password protected Intranet sites to run the technology.</td>
