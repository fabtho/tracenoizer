 Haystack mountain was a favorite lookout point for buffalo that roamed in the Gunbarrel area. After the Sand Creek Massacre, the Arapahoe tribe left the area and an era of cooperative living ended. You can stroll to quaint shops, a variety of restaurants, practical services and open space walkways. The Elementary and High School are within the area. There is great participation in the Niwot Community Association which offers a monthly newsletter.</td>

 In the 11 years since we began our great experiment, we've found that doctors and women exercise the right to abortion responsibly, without the need for any legal restrictions. And we don't need restrictions on certain types of abortions. I'd like to share with you Canada's unique history of abortion, how it came to be that we have no law, and what abortion services in Canada are like today. First, I must admit that Canada has its share of problems trying to deliver accessible abortion services to women. Some parts of Canada are run by politicians who wouldn't lift a finger to improve women's access to abortion, especially around election time.</td>
