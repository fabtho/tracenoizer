 In 1962 a fifty-six-year-old inventor named Edwin Link helped inaugurate the Undersea Age when he spent eight hours submerged off the coast of the French Riviera inside a one-man aluminum cylinder. Link's success emboldened others, and over the next 15 years at least 65 different habitats, representing the labors of 17 countries, were built. A standout was Jacques Cousteau's series of three experiments in which a total of 13 aquanauts and one parrot built fish pens, studied the marine environment, and recorded their physical and psychological reactions over the course of 59 days spent on the ocean floor. Another outstanding effort was the American Tektite II habitat, in which some of the 53 aquanauts lived for a month at a time. Medical problems in most cases were minor -- the most common being nagging ear infections.</td>

 (And also Hanson's "MMMBop" and a few Rolling Stones abortions, but why quibble. It was like 'Hey, Led Zeppelin wants a new drummer -- and we picked you. " For most any aspiring pomo popster these days, recording with the Dust Brothers has become part dream, part fraternity-style ritual. As for the ritual part, Laguana also reveled in some of the rock artifacts lying around the Dust Brothers' ranch-style Silver Lake studio. "At one point, I'm sitting outside strumming Beck's guitar plugged into Marilyn Manson's portable guitar rig," he says.</td>

 " The bill became law in 1969, exactly 100 years after abortion was first made illegal in Canada. It gave the medical profession exactly what they had asked for -- legal sanction for the status quo. You see, in the old days, groups of doctors at some big-city hospitals would get together and approve abortions by committee. So the new law was great for doctors, but it didn't do much for women. First, hospitals were not required to set up therapeutic abortion committees (TACs), so most simply didn't, even if they were the only hospital around.</td>
