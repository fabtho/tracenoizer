DnDConstants public final class DnDConstantsextends Object This class contains constant values representing the type of action(s) to be performed by a Drag and Drop operation. The link verb is found in many, if not all native DnD platforms, and the actual interpretation of LINK semantics is both platform and application dependent. Broadly speaking, the semantic is "do not copy, or move the operand, but create a reference to it". Defining the meaning of "reference" is where ambiguity is introduced. The verb is provided for completeness, but its use is not recommended for DnD operations between logically distinct applications where misinterpretation of the operations semantics could lead to confusing results for the user.</td>

 Special Abilities A special ability only affects the section in which it appears. A multiple dial warrior may use the Charge special ability as long as the sections with the Charge ability are given actions, and the sections with the Charge ability did not start the turn in base contact with an opposing figure. Movement A multiple dial warrior may only move in one of two ways on any given turn. Chariot multiple dial warriors may not move straight backwards. The dragons and the tanks have the option of moving straight backwards without turning or changing facing.</td>
