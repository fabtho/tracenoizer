 The budget for the semifinal held at the end of March 1994 was around 30000 ECU, five times more than ESTIEM's annual budget. The European Final in Eindhoven was sponsored by Philips, who had two tailor-made case concepts for the event. Cases in the final were less about management than personal sales technique. This caused bad feelings among other competitors, but not with Stockholm, who took the victory. The prize was internships for the entire team at Philips any time the winners wished - anywhere in the world.</td>
