 . See how employee suggestion programs can increase profits and customer service. Employee suggestion systems have been in existence for over one hundred years in one form or another, ranging from the proverbial suggestion box to fully-developed suggestion systems overseen by administrators, evaluators and idea specialists. To learn how employee suggestion systems can benefit your organization contact the Center for Suggestion System Development, the leader in suggestion systems design and development. Our proven tools and strategies will help you build a strong foundation for successful employee suggestion programs.</td>

 Since we consider each and every installation a showcase (almost like a showroom underwritten and maintained by our clients), we give periodic calls at no charge to make sure the system is working properly. Long-distance jobs are a great way to lose your shirt. That meant that we had to stop putting in certain kinds of products (phones, alarms) and systems (no centralized multi-zone audio controllers and NO home automation or motorization). This cost us in the overall price of the system, but it certainly didn't hurt our business, or reputation. By making every system bulletproof, service calls became almost non existent, freeing up more time for new projects.</td>

 We do not address associated issues such as constructing the proper hardware platform and reorganizing institutional procedures that use the software to improve overall operations. We discuss the initial collection of system requirements and scheduling of efforts only to the extent to which they impact analysis. Similarly, we discuss situation-dependent implementation matters such as programming in particular languages, porting to different systems, and performing release management only with respect to general design issues. Also, while we devote considerable attention to the process of OO development, we do not often address the management of this or any software development process. In order to describe the behavior of a target system, we have to describe relevant parts of the immediate context forming the boundary of the system.</td>
