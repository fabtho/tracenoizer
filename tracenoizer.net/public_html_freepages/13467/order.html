 Alan Grant, a renowned paleontologist who is asked to inspect the park; Laura Dern as his colleague, Dr. Ellie Sattler; Jeff Goldblum as a brilliant but eccentric mathematician whose chaos theory explains the dangers inherent in the project; and Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello as Hammond's young grandchildren. In order to tackle the scope and breadth of the project ahead, Winston designated a group of teams that included both artists and engineers. To give you an idea of each team's complex responsibilities, meet "Team rex," which consisted of 12 operators performing widely varying functions. Constructed from a frame of fiberglass and 3000 pounds of clay, the 20 foot tall T-rex was covered with a durable yet delicate latex skin and then painted by a team of artists who blended a rich palette of colors to bring his body to life.</td>

 The third column in Table 2 lists group size, which is a confounded factor in these data. Why might rate of idea generation be an important factor. In order to benefit from the extra stimulation of knowing the ideas of others in the groups, one must have time to both perceive the ideas (e. , in electronic tasks, reading them) and think about them. In other words, there is a cost associated with reading and thinking about the ideas of others.</td>
