 As the cast and crew lifted their glasses in a champagne toast on the final night of filming, a weary but enthusiastic Spielberg announced that "Jurassic Park," an ambitious project which had been two years in the planning and four months before the cameras, had finished on budget and 12 days ahead of schedule. . About the Production With Jurassic Park, Steven Spielberg recalled from extinction the greatest creatures our planet has ever known. 4mb To resurrect these ancient and powerful species who ruled the world for 165 million years, the director and his team of special effects wizards embarked on a three-year journey of discovery, creating new technologies, transforming old ones and ushering filmmaking into the 21st Century. In May of 1990, Universal Pictures obtained the galleys of best-selling author Michael Crichton's upcoming book Jurassic Park, and within a matter of hours, the studio was intently negotiating to purchase the book on behalf of Steven Spielberg.</td>

 There are some fun touches in this story, including Gomez arm-wrestling Thing. Rudnick wisely gives her the lion's share of this film. Production Designer Ken Adam is best known for his work on numerous entries in the James Bond series. Mercedes McNab (the perky girl scout in the first film) is a delight in this one as Wednesday's foil. Director Barry Sonnenfeld has a cameo as Joel's father.</td>
