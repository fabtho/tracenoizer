 He's a real artist at delivering this kind of film. He has a particular vision and a knack for placing the camera for complicated moves that really pay off. Equally important, his films have fleshed-out characters who carry a particluar code of honour. " Broken Arrow also stars Samantha Mathis as Park Ranger Terry Carmichael, who teams with Hale to combat Deakins and his gang. "Samantha brings a kind of sweetness and vulnerability to the character in addition to the toughness," points out Terence Chang.</td>

 Jurassic Park showed that Spielberg hadn't lost his knack for building suspense to the point that audiences are on the edge of sheer terror. Jurassic Park, like Jaws, is one of the most frightening films ever made. Spielberg's talent is almost enough to make up for the dumb script co-written by Michael Crichton (with David Koepp) and based on his book, which like most of Crichton's work, is based on an interesting premise, but quickly piles on every hot new idea he could glean from Popular Science magazine mouthed by wooden characters. The premise of Jurassic Park is that an eccentric entrepreneur, played by Sir Richard Attenborough (the Oscar-winning director of Gandhi), has discovered a way to clone dinosaurs by extracting DNA from blood found in ancient mosquitoes caught in amber, and plans to open an amusement park with living examples of the once extinct reptiles as the exhibits. The film begins with a scene that's practically lifted from the opening of Jaws.</td>
