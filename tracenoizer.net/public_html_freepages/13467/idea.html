<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" But the big disappointment is Robert De Niro's Al Capone. All of the movie's Capone segments seem cut off from the rest of the story; they're like regal set pieces, dropped in from time to time. De Niro comes on screen with great dramatic and musical flourish, strikes an attitude, says a line, and that's basically the whole idea. There isn't a glimmer of a notion of what made this man tick, this Al Capone who was such an organizational genius that he founded an industry and became a millionaire while he was still a young man. The best performance in the movie is by Sean Connery, as a Scottish-American cop who signs on as Ness's right-hand man and seems, inexplicably, to know everything about the mob and its liquor business.">

 Unblocking Brainstorming Through the Use of a Simple Group Editor Charles McLaughlin Hymes, Gary M. These earlier tools are essentially computerized versions of Nominal Group Technique. We examined the ability of a simple, unstructured parallel editor to facilitate idea generation in face to face groups. Our results showed that parallel interacting groups outperformed serial interacting groups, and parallel interacting groups did not differ significantly from nominal, non interacting groups. Thus, an informal tool that allows parallel work is an effective way to increase idea generation in real interacting groups.</td>

 Jurassic Park showed that Spielberg hadn't lost his knack for building suspense to the point that audiences are on the edge of sheer terror. Jurassic Park, like Jaws, is one of the most frightening films ever made. Spielberg's talent is almost enough to make up for the dumb script co-written by Michael Crichton (with David Koepp) and based on his book, which like most of Crichton's work, is based on an interesting premise, but quickly piles on every hot new idea he could glean from Popular Science magazine mouthed by wooden characters. The premise of Jurassic Park is that an eccentric entrepreneur, played by Sir Richard Attenborough (the Oscar-winning director of Gandhi), has discovered a way to clone dinosaurs by extracting DNA from blood found in ancient mosquitoes caught in amber, and plans to open an amusement park with living examples of the once extinct reptiles as the exhibits. The film begins with a scene that's practically lifted from the opening of Jaws.</td>

 None the less RECAp has been observed to substantially improve web site structure, while helping design terams maintain focus on users and usability Active Design Documents Guy A. Proceedings of the eighth ACM conference on Hypertext, pages 57-66 Abstract In this paper we discuss the use of design patterns for the process of building hypermedia applications. The idea of design patterns has been recently developed, and rapidly spread outside the object-oriented community to a general audience of software developers. By using patterns it is not only possible to document design experience with a very simple and comprehensible format, but also reuse the same experience several times for different applications. We argue that the hypermedia community will take a vital step towards better designs of hypermedia applications and systems by developing a pattern language for that domain.</td>
