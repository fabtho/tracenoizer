 . Back in the studio after nearly two years, nothing has really changed and boy it brings back memories. Well today is always the hardest day, because as a band we have to get a very professional head on, as we have to be pro's for the next week. Anyway enough of my knowledge and down to what I have done today. 'My Mafia', 'Orphan Origin' and 'High-Octane Party', were recorded basically for drums and bass today, I'm only playing guitar as a guide for Matt and Iain.</td>
