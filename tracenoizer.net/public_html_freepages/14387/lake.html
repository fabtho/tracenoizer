 The Marion Steinbach Indian Basket Museum houses a world-class collection of 800 Native American baskets representing tribes from the plains to the Southwest. . North Lake Tahoe Historical Society North Lake Tahoe Historical Society Tahoe City, California The North Lake Tahoe Historical Society was founded in 1969 and incorporated in 1971 by a group of concerned citizens who saw many of our landmark structures torn down in the 1960's to build condominium developments. Determined to preserve our local history, the non-profit, public benefit corporation dedicated itself to the study, preservation and interpretation of Lake Tahoe history. It's first major project was to preserve the Historic Gatekeeper's Cabin, then to rebuild the structure as a museum after it was destroyed by arson fire in 1978.</td>

 . When her book begins, Williams' mother has just been diagnosed with ovarian cancer, and the book follows the next five years of her life and death. At the same time, the Great Salt Lake is rising to record heights, flooding the Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge and scattering the birds and animals with whom Williams has lived her life. CommentaryWith it's beautiful and poetic, yet clear and readable language, this book stands out as one of the best of the illness narratives. The contrast of nature acting on the Great Salt Lake, as detailed by maps and water measurements throughout the book, against the natural--or unnatural--cycle and death of Williams' mother and grandmother is set to add to each story.</td>
