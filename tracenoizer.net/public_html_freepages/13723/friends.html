 For this reason it has come to be called the Smile Factory. In the mid 60's, the building briefly suffered through a third incarnation, this as a roller skating rink. It's not hard to imagine skaters circling the auditorium floor while friends watched form the mezzanine above, but the venture did not fare well and was short lived. At this time, the clearance of the old area to the east of Soulard for the new Kosciusko Industrial Park caused the Powercraft Corporation, which had been in business for decades, to search for a new location. In 1967, Powercraft bought 2001 South 9th Street and began to manufacture there what certainly must be Soulard's most unique product, heavy duty switches for electrified rail systems.</td>

I don't know how this came to be seeing as how this is Western Washington, and you are in Louisiana, but I just wanted to ask you to change that prayer request to one for Lowen's family. I can't tell you how much it means to me to know that there were people all over the country praying for not only his health, but his salvation.</td>
