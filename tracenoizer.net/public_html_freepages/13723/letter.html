 The honorary alumnus award from Assumption College was awarded to Larry Spongberg, reference librarian at d'Alzon Library. With the children off to school, Brian invites friends to share his "empty nest" in Kelso. His letter sounds more inviting than any travel brochure possibly could. In addition, Steve Jefro and Dick Gordon are planning to meet Brian in Reno to enjoy the Super Bowl. If you are interested in joining the group for the weekend, please contact Brian.</td>
