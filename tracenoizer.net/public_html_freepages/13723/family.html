 Eileen Johnston Carbone described it as feeling like 1970 again when she and her husband Gary "retired" two years ago, sold their house, second car and most of their stuff, climbed into the Jeep and headed west. They have settled (for now) in San Diego where their daughter Elsha also lives, but "we aren't yet sure what we'll do when we grow up. " I was looking forward to Alice Crowe Smith and her family being transferred to the Washington area, but Chuck's orders were changed and the Smiths moved from Hawaii to Osan, Korea. John Huber was awarded a Presidential Award of Merit from Meredith College, where he is professor of psychology. We shared the anxieties of having a teenage driver in the family; her son is 16.</td>
