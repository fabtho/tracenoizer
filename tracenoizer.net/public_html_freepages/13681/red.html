 We were ecstatic for what we had accomplished, and we all felt light-headed for days afterwards. (Later that summer Al drove the 'Dealer' to Top Speed of the 13th U. He red-lighted away the first round at that meet, while recording the Dealer's all-time best ET - 6. ) This month, June, 1997, will mark the 25th anniversary of Al's passing.

 Cal Equipped, Haines and Cross, spent the whole summer in the Midwest. In fact, Clark Marshall came through town in his type Jaguar and stopped to visit with Arvy while his team was in town. Al Williams and Archie Leiderbrand were touring with Als' wife and daughter all crammed into the front seat of that Red Ranchero. Bobby Sullivan was on the road steady, unless his route from race to race took him home. He had his 60 Olds Wagon set up so he could and did sleep in the back, to save money.</td>
