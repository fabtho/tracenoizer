 ) Our first qualifying run at LIONS resulted in a broken right-side exhaust header, and an unacceptable time. We scrambled to get another header to replace the broken one. (Not so easily done as one might think, in those days. ) After much effort we were finally ready to make our second qualifying pass, the last by anyone that day. (LIONS was a scary strip to run on, especially for those not familiar with it.</td>

 Tell the dealer you are not interested in allowances; you want to know how much they will pay you for your used-car even if you don't buy a new one from them. It's actually best to first sell your used-vehicle in the dealership used-car department, then come back the next day and shop wisely for your new car. You will save the most money this way, even if have to cab it for a few days or rent a car for a few weeks. The buying and selling of vehicles occurs 40 million times a year in the United States, and a major percentage of those transactions are from trade-ins. Trade-ins keep dealerships in business; and buyers like them because the whole buying and selling process is made so easy for them.</td>

 Where records were set and memories will never be forgotten. Dave Dewars a 1320 member from Minnesota recently uncovered several pcxs taken during that summer, below is Minnesota Raceway's track photographer's comment about that summer. Over the next few days, I'll post all of Dave's pictures, the first of them are posted below with Big Yohns' comments. This is a great time of the year to look back and that year, 1960, was a magic year for me as it probably was for Pit Crew Pete. In my view, 1960 was a kind of watershed year, when cars really started traveling around the country, and some even touring for the whole summer.</td>
