When you have had your surfeit of poetical whimsy and are ready for some good, hard facts, come here to be set straight. When Cagney, Bogart, Robinson and Raft got in a turf war, this is how they talked. I'm sure it wasn't because of the Back Street Boys.</td>

 Irregular tire wear is another tip-off of poor maintenance, since uneven tire wear, outside or inside, could mean front end alignment problems or even that the vehicle has had frame damage. Dealers will check your suspension and if your Mercury needs new shocks, they wonder what else you've neglected. All they need do to test your suspension is to quickly press down hard, several times on the corners of your Mercury, then let up. If your car continues to bounce, they'll have all the proof they'll need to devalue your Mercury. The few hundred dollars you'll need for new shocks may or may not be worth the price.</td>
