 I was the assistant manager at a suburban-Maryland speed shop who had just come into a large inheritance. That wasn't my original plan, but - as it turned out - I agreed. despite the fact that Al had never raced anything faster than a Chevy 409 before. He knew exactly how to approach this challenge, and he made it sound easily workable. During the year that he drove for me, Al blossomed.</td>

 Ivo was, of course, one of the most notable to start touring in 1960. Cal Equipped, Haines and Cross, spent the whole summer in the Midwest. In fact, Clark Marshall came through town in his type Jaguar and stopped to visit with Arvy while his team was in town. Al Williams and Archie Leiderbrand were touring with Als' wife and daughter all crammed into the front seat of that Red Ranchero. Bobby Sullivan was on the road steady, unless his route from race to race took him home.</td>

 I disliked the article when I read it, though probably not for the reasons most of the Rothman-bashers out there dislike it. My complaint with "My Fake Job" is that it was too easy, that it comes from a reportorial universe where all conclusions are foreordained and the purpose of journalism is merely to confirm one's prejudices. Reading the article, you could keep a checklist of standard dot-com jokes, marking off each hoary "fact" as Rothman rediscovers it. Technology is dehumanizing and people at technology companies don't know one another. Dot-coms are in trouble, no questions why, and here come the layoffs.</td>
