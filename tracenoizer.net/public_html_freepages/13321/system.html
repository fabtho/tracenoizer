 When we work at distances arms length or closer, our eyes are constantly focusing to achieve clear vision. Not surprisingly as a result, when our eyes tire or strain, our head tires and since our head controls how our whole body feels, we get home after a day of near work and our whole body feels exhausted.

 Rationale Users may not be able to hear or distinguish sounds if they are deaf or hard-of-hearing, work in noisy environments, or turn off sounds to avoid disturbing others. In order for these users to respond to audio alerts, those alerts must be presented visually as well.

Techniques Use one or more of the following techniques to meet Checkpoint 3. Windows application developers should check the ShowSounds flag by calling the SystemParametersInfo function with the SPI_GETSHOWSOUNDS value, and if set, present visual equivalents of all audio information.</td>
