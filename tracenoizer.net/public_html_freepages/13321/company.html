 Doll and distributed through RTMark, CueJack allows consumers to scan product barcodes to learn "alternative information" about corporations. The CueCat scanner was shipped last fall to subscribers of Wired and Forbes magazines and is distributed free of charge at Radio Shack stores in the US. Using CueCat's bundled software, consumers scan UPC codes on products and are whisked directly to company webpages depicting tidily packaged images of the company and product. A "software parody," CueJack allows this same consumerist scanning technique to instead whisk users to webpages containing information such as boycotts against the manufacturer, corporate misbehavior, or company profits. The information CueJack displays comes from sources all over the web.</td>

RTMark, an organization that offers bounties for "acts of creative subversion against mass-produced items," is now offering free software that turns CueCat against its corporate masters. With the software, called CueJack, in place, a scan of a bar-coded Web address will actually point the user to Web sites that contain critical information about the company in question. CueJack was developed by a hacker who goes by the nom de guerre of Cue P. "It's not that I have some vendetta against CueCat," Doll told The Net Economy in an e-mail interview.</td>
