 No more fiddling around with endless tape cassettes or burning a CD, only to have the director change their mind. Simply cue up all the sound effects on your computer and click to play. Change the order on the fly, fade in, fade out, add new ones and save your cue list ready for the performance. It also has a built in text editor so you can mark your cues on the script on screen.

 For long term theatrical productions CueDriver allows you to record custom cue elements for each performer and understudy in your cast. You then select the performer lineup before each performance to create a unique set of cues tailored to each performer. Variations to cue order can be preprogrammed for different versions of a show. CueDriver essentially acts as the ghost-hands of the operator. The mixing engineer still has the ultimate control over what is occurring, and can override or edit cues, and cue order on the fly.</td>

 The new version has been completely redesigned and equipped with a multitude of new features. The redesigned interface optimizes the user's interaction and workflow, and is more closely oriented towards DJ hardware, extended by the specific possibilities of a modern software solution. The various functions are separated into individual groups, which can be selectively hidden in order to make more room for the control elements most important to the individual user. For example, when TRAKTOR is controlled with an external DJ mixer, the software mixer can be hidden in order to grant more space to the playlist. There are a number of parameters with which to program scratches, cuts and fades, which can then be saved as presets and accessed through hot keys.</td>
