 We had both previously worked for Control Data and were pioneers in developing engineering approaches to software development, which was a new concept at the time. To the best of my knowledge, though, this was the first use of the term in Silicon Valley. I had also specialized in developing software that would measure computer performance and we thought that there would be a big market for that kind of software product in the rapidly-growing IBM 360 customer base. So the plan was to sell our services as software engineering consultants and get the money together to be able to develop some performance measurement products for the IBM 360 market. Software product companies were a really unknown concept so we had a hard time finding a venture capitalist who would listen to us.</td>

 Looking into 2001, Digital Convergence hopes to distribute forty to fifty million of their inexpensive scanners. , an acronym for Keystroke Automations Technology, the driving force behind the cat. itself is really a handheld scanner that attaches to a personal computer like a mouse. This optical scanner cat reads bar codes that automatically bring up specific Web sites on the computer screen. Digital Convergence This feline-shaped, mouse-sized scanner will provide digital convergence by bridging the gap between the Internet and today's print, video, and audio media.</td>
