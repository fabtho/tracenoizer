 Developed by seven Indian engineers, the device will be shared by village cooperatives throughout Third World countries. The units lack a keyboard, but feature a touch-sensitive display, simple visual icons and voice synthesis for the illiterate. Users will carry inexpensive smart cards that can hold data and settings and will leverage the Internet for multilingual translation support. Understanding collaboration between firms Collaboration can be defined as the cross-coordination of resources across organizational boundaries, essentially two separate firms working together. Collaborations usually include an agreement, but not all the potential situations can be efficiently covered in the contract.</td>

 Information for Contributors Information for Contributors The JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT (JITM) is a forum for the communication of solutions found by practitioners and academicians to the multifaceted problems associated with managing information and information technology as a corporate resource. JITM is published by Maximilian Press on a quarterly basis and is sponsored by the ASSOCIATION OF MANAGEMENT. Written for non-technical audiences of practitioners and of academicians, the Journal invites manuscripts with a strong applied orientation in topics such as strategic importance of information systems; information systems planning and policy; systems development alternatives, methods and tools; end-user systems development and management; data base design and administration; network and telecommunications design and management; role and effectiveness of the information executive; and behavioral and human resources aspects of information systems. Because of the two audiences served by the Journal, (practitioners and academicians) special formats for manuscript publishing were adopted specifically for articles, short studies and case studies. Emphasis on testing of existing concepts, frameworks and methodologies, and on development and testing of methodologies, procedures and techniques to support the managerial use of information technology.</td>
