 Information for Contributors Information for Contributors The JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT (JITM) is a forum for the communication of solutions found by practitioners and academicians to the multifaceted problems associated with managing information and information technology as a corporate resource. JITM is published by Maximilian Press on a quarterly basis and is sponsored by the ASSOCIATION OF MANAGEMENT. Written for non-technical audiences of practitioners and of academicians, the Journal invites manuscripts with a strong applied orientation in topics such as strategic importance of information systems; information systems planning and policy; systems development alternatives, methods and tools; end-user systems development and management; data base design and administration; network and telecommunications design and management; role and effectiveness of the information executive; and behavioral and human resources aspects of information systems. Because of the two audiences served by the Journal, (practitioners and academicians) special formats for manuscript publishing were adopted specifically for articles, short studies and case studies. Emphasis on testing of existing concepts, frameworks and methodologies, and on development and testing of methodologies, procedures and techniques to support the managerial use of information technology.</td>

 . Analysis of Metadata Creation Tools MetaWeb Project Analysis of Metadata Creation Tools Introductory Note These evaluations have been undertaken by the MetaWeb Project in good faith for the purpose of assisting the Australian metadata community to choose tools which are most suitable for in-house use. The MetaWeb Project is a joint partnership of the Australian Defence Force Academy, Charles Sturt University, the Distributed Systems Technology Centre and the National Library of Australia. Adherence to the Dublin Core metadata standard is achieved with varying levels of success by the tools mentioned, so a close examination of whether to supply more than unqualified Dublin Core needs to be completed before implementing extensive amounts of metadata. The qualified Dublin Core standard is yet to be fully developed.</td>
