 You will achieve more predictable results by unifying your team with common processes that improve communication and create a common understanding of all tasks, responsibilities, and artifacts. On one centralized web exchange, Rational Software, platform vendors, tool vendors and domains experts provide the process components you need to be successful. Using online browser navigation, each team member has instant access to RUP's knowledge base and process guidelines from their desktop. The knowledge base further unifies the team by identifying and assigning responsibilities, artifacts, and tasks so each member of the team understands his contribution to the project. By unifying your team, you can streamline communication and ensure that you efficiently allocate resources, deliver the right artifacts, and meet deadlines.</td>

 The data should not be taken as an exact representation of the nutrient content of your diet. The numbers used for analysis are averages and there is great variance in nutrient content for each food item in the database. The nutrient information is also not complete for every food listed in NAT as there are still gaps in our knowledge of food composition. With these limitations in mind, I believe that the tool can provide valuable information on the relative composition of food and I hope this tool will aid you in your quest to achieve or maintain good health via nutritious eating. Assistant Professor Coming Soon - The Nutrition Analysis Tool Food Diary Study Interested in participating.</td>
