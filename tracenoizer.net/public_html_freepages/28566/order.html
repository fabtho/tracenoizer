 Right across Third Avenue from the ramp (at 25th Street) is a surface lot with 72 spaces. The new, two-level lot, located at the northeast corner of Third Avenue and 24th Street, has provided an addition 147 spaces since it opened in December 2000. Tickets instruct you to obtain an exit code from the museum in order to exit the lot after your visit. The new lot is under camera surveillance and is patrolled by museum security staff. Call boxes are located on both levels and at both exits.</td>

 The aim of our work is to modify these trojan peptides so that they can transport the immunotoxins across the membrane. As the trojan peptides can not distinguish tumour cells from normal cells, it should only become effective after the antibody has bound to the tumour cell. In order to develop such a protein which fulfills all these functions, and others not mentioned, requires years of research. To test the effect of individual developed peptides, we use so-called cell lines. They originate from 'genuine' tumour cells and can be propagated in the laboratory in incubators.</td>

 The outbreak of the illness usually develops in the latter half of life (men are more frequently affected), at which time however, unreversible damage to the organs has already occurred. Early diagnosis of the illness is therefore important. In order to promptly diagnose and treat this disease and other illnesses due to defective iron metabolism, it is important to better understand the iron uptake process than is currently the case. Our research essentially deals with three proteins, the transferrin receptor, transferrin and the haemochromatosis protein (HFE). Transferrin is found in the blood where it binds iron and transports it to the individual cells (further information about cells and the cell membrane is available in Easy-text under Immunotoxins).</td>
