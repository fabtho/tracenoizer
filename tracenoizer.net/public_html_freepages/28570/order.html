 All of the newest post offices have been in "evil" communities, so it gives the appearance that evil communities will not be part of the current system. That may be fine (when ERs are back in the game I find it hard to imagine some representative Uruk-Hai from Cirith Ungol coming to the White Tower to vote on issues), but in the absence of a Plan, it looks like an oversight. In order to participate in selecting an MC representative, characters must register in a town with representation, or a town that is linked in some way to a community that does. This effectively deprives anyone of participation (by vote) in MC matters unless they run around and temporarily register at different mailboxes, a practice that runs contrary to the establishment of communities. With the removal of the main comms, the towncomms were to encourage communication within communities, yet, not having a towncomm active deprives members of community interaction.</td>
