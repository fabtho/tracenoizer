 We show examples where this technique allows a deliberative system to reason about the objects (cars) detected by a vision system embarked in an unmanned helicopter, in the framework of the Witas project. . One important aspect of this link is how to connect, or anchor, the symbols used at the higher level to the objects in the vision system that these symbols refer to. Anchoring is complicated by the fact that the vision data are inherently affected by uncertainty. We propose an anchoring technique that uses fuzzy sets to represent the uncertainty in the perceptual data.</td>

 . Unlike most pattern recognition systems, this approach does not totally rely on the intervention of a human to extract and define a set of features for it. This new system is capable of efficiently searching a database of raw information to match patterns and detect objects. A new pattern recognition and detection technique will help radiologists select suspicious areas of digital mammograms for further study.
