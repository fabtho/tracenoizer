 . One important aspect of this link is how to connect, or anchor, the symbols used at the higher level to the objects in the vision system that these symbols refer to. Anchoring is complicated by the fact that the vision data are inherently affected by uncertainty. We propose an anchoring technique that uses fuzzy sets to represent the uncertainty in the perceptual data. We show examples where this technique allows a deliberative system to reason about the objects (cars) detected by a vision system embarked in an unmanned helicopter, in the framework of the Witas project.</td>

 For most OS's Unicos AIX Setting the TCP window size under Unicos How big do I set the TCP window. Setting the TCP window size with nettest More sources of information What is this TCP Window Thing. A TCP window the amount of outstanding (unacknowledged by the recipient) data a sender can send on a particular connection before it gets an acknowledgment back from the receiver that it has gotten some of it. For example if a pair of hosts are talking over a TCP connection that has a TCP window size of 64 KB (kilobytes), the sender can only send 64 KB of data and then it must stop and wait for an acknowledgment from the receiver that some or all of the data has been received. If the receiver acknowledges that all the data has been received then the sender is free to send another 64 KB.</td>

 . Experiment Information Experiment Information Experiment Title (ID) Role of Visual Cues in Spatial Orientation (9301136) Research Area Neurophysiology Species Studied Homo sapiens (Human) Principal Investigator Oman, Charles M. Experiment Description Due to the right of subjects who participate in scientific studies to restrict the use of their data, only selected human subject experiment data are available at this time. This experiment focused on how the balance between visual and vestibular cues shifts toward the visual system in microgravity. Information gained from this experiment will help investigators understand why, in the absence of gravity, astronauts become dependent on visual stimuli.</td>
