 . Sure, soccer is not as action-packed as hockey or basketball, but it's almost like a live action chess game that can occasionally take on a life of its own. But it usually takes the effort of an extraordinary and talented player to take the game to new levels, and David Beckham is the kind of player that makes fans stand up. But that wasn't enough to impress us; what really convinced us was his supernatural-like ability to score goals from one side of the field to another. A footballer with uncanny ability to score goals and get the crowd on its feet.</td>

 It takes many months to create and populate a stadium. Beginning with a wire frame model built to the exact specification of the real-world stadium it represents, textures are added to give the model depth and a physical presence. Once the lighting is switched on, the illusion is complete and you can really believe you are out there before 80,000 chanting fans. David has worked closely with Rage to ensure that we capture his likeness in our 3D models. When David's hair cut changed dramatically earlier this year, we were informed in advance to make sure that our virtual Beckham was up to date.</td>
