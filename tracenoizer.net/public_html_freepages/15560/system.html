 Our objective is to extend existing control theory to ensure reliable and affordable manufacture of products from new aerospace materials. Major innovations in in-situ remodeling and multivariant nonlinear optimization are emerging. We integrate materials and scope design with process design through memory-driven, feature-based design system. This system provides affordability analysis of alternative materials and processes. Our impetus is to extend the concept of self-directed systems from process control to process design.</td>

 Additionally there is no budget for modifying existing programs and no engineering resource available; resource has logically been allocated to new products. The result of an ergonomics intervention is thus, to some large degree, a compromise solution. Certainly there are some successes where simple, cost effective solutions can be implemented but these appear to be more common at individual work stations and not with regard to the total production system. , are thus important and fundamental system parameters that frequently cannot be retroactively resolved. Consequently productivity and quality penalties associated with these concerns must continue throughout the life of the production program with a concurrent reduction of profits.</td>
