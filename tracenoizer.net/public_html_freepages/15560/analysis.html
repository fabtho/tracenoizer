 Each subject was required to key text and random letters for six 20-minute sessions on each of the two (traditional and Kinesis) keyboards. Subjects were given seven hours of keying practice on the Kinesis keyboard the day before the test. Postural analysis showed hand deviation and extension were substantially less on the Kinesis keyboard than on the traditional keyboard. Analysis of muscle load revealed substantially less load on muscles controlling hand deviation, extension, and pronation on the Kinesis keyboard. Subjects exhibited virtually the same muscle load for elbow adbuction for both keyboards by the end of each test.</td>
