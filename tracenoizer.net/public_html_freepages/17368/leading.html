Byrd, Freeman and Howard (1993) simulated NGC 4622's pattern with a small companion in a plunging retrograde orbit in the disk plane. This encounter created a single long-lived central leading arm.

 Academic Programs Office - Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution '; document. and foreign universities that have marine interests have participated in the research at WHOI since it was founded in 1930. WHOI's educational role, at the graduate level, was formalized in 1968 with a change in its charter and the signing of an agreement with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for a Joint Program leading to doctoral (Ph. Joint master's degrees are also offered in selected areas of the program. Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution is also authorized to grant doctoral degrees independently.</td>

 . Measles Initiative Each year, a disease barely remembered by most Americans kills nearly one million children, a half million of those in Africa alone. This fact makes measles the single leading cause of death among children in Africa - more than HIV, more than tuberculosis, and more than malaria. In a place where health conditions are extremely poor, living conditions are more than difficult, and access to health care is minimal, measles can be easily prevented with a simple vaccination. The Measles Initiative is a long-term commitment to control measles deaths in Africa by vaccinating 200 million children, preventing 1.</td>

 Kim Barnett was the first to go, for two sixth overs in, and he was followed in the next over by Craig Spearman, caught by Muchall for four. By the time Matt Windows (two) was run out by Peng, the visitors had slumped to 10 for three. Alleyne reached 18 before his partnership with Craig Taylor was ended when the captain got a leading edge from a short Killeen ball which was caught by Michael Gough at gully. With the score rooted on 95 Taylor was given out lbw for 37 and Snape also failed to see out the day after being unable to deal with a short delivery from Hunter and being caught for 28 by Pratt. .</td>
