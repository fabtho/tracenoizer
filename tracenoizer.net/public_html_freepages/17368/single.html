 . Measles Initiative Each year, a disease barely remembered by most Americans kills nearly one million children, a half million of those in Africa alone. This fact makes measles the single leading cause of death among children in Africa - more than HIV, more than tuberculosis, and more than malaria. In a place where health conditions are extremely poor, living conditions are more than difficult, and access to health care is minimal, measles can be easily prevented with a simple vaccination. The Measles Initiative is a long-term commitment to control measles deaths in Africa by vaccinating 200 million children, preventing 1.</td>

 Muchall matched Pratt's feat, reaching 50, but was unable to take it on - out lbw for 52 from a short Jeremy Snape ball. Pratt moved on towards a century assisted by Ian Hunter, who made 33 before becoming Snape's second victim. Then, with the score on 459 for eight and Pratt seven runs short of his century, he attempted a quick single with Graeme Bridge and was run out at the bowler's end. The unbeaten Bridge (12) and Mark Davies (one not out) added a further 11 runs before Collingwood declared. His bowlers wasted no time in making early inroads into the visitors' batting line-up.</td>
