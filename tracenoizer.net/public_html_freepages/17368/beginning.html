 Pratt had earlier followed up the sterling work of younger brother Gary to record a new highest score of 93 and lead Durham to 470 for eight declared in their first innings. Durham began on 238 for three with Paul Collingwood unbeaten at the crease on 47, but got an outside edge off a Mark Alleyne delivery when on 65 which was caught behind by Russell. Nicky Peng was beginning to look settled having cracked three fours to reach 19, but he soon followed his captain back to the pavilion having being trapped lbw by Ian Fisher. Gloucestershire were sensing they were back in the game with Durham on 275 for five, but their hopes were dashed by Gordon Muchall and Pratt. They put on a 100-run partnership to take their side in at lunch on 375 for five.</td>

 However, the extremely likeable Affleck does pull off the part. At one point, Ryan yells at him, "I don't go on missions, I just write reports. " Maintaining standards Another big reason for this film's success is producer Mace Neufeld, who has nurtured the Clancy franchise from the beginning. It also should be noted that the score by Oscar winner Jerry Goldsmith is excellent. The storyline carries a haunting sense of the possible.</td>
