<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" On the morning of Tim's Ride, October 15, 2000, a low lying fog chilled a group of cyclists and hikers that met to carry Tim's ashes up the mountain. The ride started in Fairfax, went up Deer Park, over to Pine Mt. The sun greeted them once they neared the top, revealing beautiful vistas above cities fogged in. Charlie Cunningham and Patrick Seidler led the way as bikes were left behind in a quest for the perfect vista for Tim. Charlie eventually found it, an open spot against a backdrop of trees at the edge of a cliff with a panoramic view.">
