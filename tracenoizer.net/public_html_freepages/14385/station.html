 He stayed at Appledore until 1947 when he was loaned to the Merchant Navy where, for the next two years, he sailed twice round the world visiting many countries including Japan and Canada. Charlie married Madge in August 1949, they have had 52 happy years together. Charlie left the shipyard for good in 1956 to go to the half complete East Yelland Power Station where he was seconded to Parsons to assist with the completion of the remaining turbines. In 1960 he transferred to the training school which had been set up in 1957 by Tom Godfrey who was at that time the sole instructor. Charlie enjoyed his work at the school immensely, feeling (justifiably) that he had helped many young men to a good start in their working lives.</td>
