 html Back to top Sport and Recreation The Sports Centre situated between Keynes College and CBS, offers a wide range of facilities for both individual and team sports. For students, Sports Centre classes and use of the facilities are free, and there are concessionary rates for the use of the sauna and solarium, and for a fitness test and programme. html UKC has a flourishing programme of music and, because there is no academic music department here, students of all subjects have the opportunity to get involved in the wide-range of extra-curricular music activities. html The University also has its own theatre, the Gulbenkian Theatre, situated close to the Templeman Library. It is part of the Unit for the Enhancement of Learning and Teaching (UELT), and is based near the banks.</td>

 Valedictorian Michael Shelling, who will attend the University of Miami, earned a 5. Springer, with his middle school grades taken out, earned a 5. Contention is not unusual in Spanish River's annual race to the top academic slot. Last year, the chase for the valedictorian's honor destroyed a seven-year friendship between the top two contenders, who went to Yale and Harvard. When Springer was looking for college-level courses, he proposed the wine class, described as a look at the "role of wine in modern culture" in an FAU course summary.</td>
