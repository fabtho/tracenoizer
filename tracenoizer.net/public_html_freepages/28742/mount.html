 Remember that this is a fundraiser for the Global Peace Walk and your donations are greatly appreciated and needed for its success. This conference was sponsored for the benefit of the Global Peace Walk by the DePalma Institute and dedicated to the memory of the late Bruce DePalma, former senior scientist with the Polaroid Corporation, lecturer at MIT on electrical engineering and photographic science, discoverer of the heretofore unsuspected influences of rotation on physical properties that led to his invention of the n-Machine "free-energy" generator duplicated in several places around the world. DePalma Institute will be represented at this conference by Andrew Mount who quit school at the University of California at Santa Barbara in 1988 to become DePalma's administrative assistant until his passing October 4, 1997. Andrew is actively working on the development of a new-energy research center at Capital Hills California in Tehachapi. For more info on this, see the Capital Hills Research Center list archives.</td>
