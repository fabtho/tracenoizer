 Town of Denton - History Denton, seat of Caroline County, is on the Choptank River and generally near the geographic center of the county and the Eastern Shore of Maryland. The name of the ground designated for public use was to be Edentown. The Caroline County Court first met in march of 1774 at Melvill's Warehouse which was located north of Pig Point on the Choptank River - temporary quarters which had to suffice for conducting the administrative and judicial business of the county at that time (and for many years thereafter). Plans for the construction of a permanent courthouse at Pig Point were begun during that first court session, but the impending conflict with Great Britain caused the postponement of construction of the public buildings at Edentown. Thus began the settlement of what was to develop into the village and town of Denton.</td>
