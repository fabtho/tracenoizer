This conference was sponsored for the benefit of the Global Peace Walk by the DePalma Institute and dedicated to the memory of the late Bruce DePalma, former senior scientist with the Polaroid Corporation, lecturer at MIT on electrical engineering and photographic science, discoverer of the heretofore unsuspected influences of rotation on physical properties that led to his invention of the n-Machine "free-energy" generator duplicated in several places around the world. DePalma Institute will be represented at this conference by Andrew Mount who quit school at the University of California at Santa Barbara in 1988 to become DePalma's administrative assistant until his passing October 4, 1997.

 This bridge remained a toll bridge until shortly before the Civil War, when it was sold to the county and in about 1875 was replaced by the iron bridge which remained standing until 1913, when another iron bridge was constructed. At that time, extensive reinforcement was done on the bridge until a new concrete bridge could be built. Construction of the new bridge was begun in early 1980 and the present bridge was dedicated on Memorial Day weekend, 1981. Sometime before 1860, there was a stage line started between Easton and Felton, Delaware via Denton. After 1860, the stage met the Chester Riverboat at Queenstown.</td>
