 Taguchi's Loss Function - Taguchi's Loss Function is a method of measuring quality central to Taguchi's approach to design. It establishes a financial measure of the user dissatisfaction with a product's performance as it deviates from a target value. Thus, both average performance and variation are critical measures of quality.
