 But it is particularly geared toward administrative processing of an external event, from the moment it comes to the attention of the company until its processing is completed. Workflow applications are designed to know which tasks and procedures to apply to the cases they are designed to process. They break a case down into separate tasks and assign each one to a particular user, or participant , according to the management procedures in effect at the time. Workflow applications are generally linked to electronic document management applications, and they can bring about productivity gains of 20 to 50 per cent in the tasks they automate, and a 30 to 90 per cent reduction in delays. Document Management Systems Electronic document management used to be used only in rare, critical instances.</td>
