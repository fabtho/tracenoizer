 .com Before the greens turned hard and dry, before the leader's hat swirled away in a stiff afternoon wind, it was hard to understand the fuss. '' That was Green's opinion on the front nine yesterday, when he and playing partner Gil Morgan played The Slammer and The Squire course at World Golf Village in 8 under par. ''We played pretty good for a bunch of old men,'' said Green, whose round-brim, blue hat blew off just before chipping to set up a par on the par-4 No. ''The course is very tough - no doubt about it,'' Wargo said.</td>

 The revised version of the report and motion for a resolution containing the various amendments is now available. The question of how libraries can support citizens' access to information has also been raised independently by the Council and the Commission. The Telematics for Libraries sector welcomed the recommendation in the Morgan report calling for a Green Paper on the role of libraries in the Information Society. We have therefore collected information and facts on national policies and libraries in the Information Society as we believe the issue is a timely one. The Green Paper's main purpose would be to stimulate discussion towards a coherent approach on how, within the context of the evolving Information Society, libraries can best serve the needs of European citizens by providing mediated access to the growing wealth of digital resources.</td>

 this pub which dealt with rough trade until in July 1999 has metamophorsid into a trendy Chelsea bar restarant. It is almost exactly what the French think of as a wine bar. Situated just off the King's Road and only a minute's walk from Chelsea Green,the air-conditioned interior have been influenced by traditional and contemporary design which helps to give what the owners describe as 'giving the impression of a gentleman's library with a feminine feel'. Personally I do other things in librarys and only with books. There is an extensive range of beers, both casked ale, direct from the barrel and bottled beers, over a dozen different wines by the glass and outstanding food from a menu that changes regularly.</td>
