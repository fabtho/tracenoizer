 Povar, Consulting Editor Elva Mathiesen, Assistant Editor Allan M. at the University of Wisconsin, Madison in 1956, under the guidance of Harry F. He spent two years doing post-doctoral research with Roger Sperry at Cal Tech, then was hired by Brown University as an assistant professor of psychology. He immediately began to establish a primate behavior laboratory, but found that there was no central source of practical information about establishing and running a facility with caged nonhuman primates. He set about remedying the situation with the Laboratory Primate Newsletter, which has been published quarterly since its inception in 1962.</td>
