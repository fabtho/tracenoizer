 If the intention is to create a program that will be sustained from year to year, it is important to establish a cycle of leadership that will provide experience and know-how in the future. Wide support can be gained by framing the objectives of a campaign in terms of general benefit to the individual or to an entire group. Campus prevention programs rarely command the resources necessary for professional services, purchase of media advertising, and evaluation of programs. Using students as volunteers or paid employees in a prevention effort not only saves money but helps identify the campaign with the student population. Seeking sponsorships or other support in the way of cash or in-kind contributions is another tactic in campaign budgeting.</td>
