 And this brings us to the real cause of the conflict which is shaking the government coalition. Back at the time when the Nationals belonged to the so-called block of "parties of Slovenian spring" and when negotiations began with Drnovsek concerning creation of a "large coalition", Podobnik conditioned his agreement to join the government with the demand, among other, that ministry of education be given to his party. Already at the time, he claimed in his public statements that the school was still too "red" - to summarise his stands as much as possible, and that it was necessary to increase the contents with religious messages and system of values in the teaching process. The only obstacle to this is the Constitution of Slovenia which has strictly separated the Church from the state, although many concessions have been made to the Catholic Church (not the other religions) - including of church educational institutions into public schooling system, for one. Prolonging of the mandate of the national curriculum council turned out to be a good opportunity for straining relations in the coalition and by changing the names in the council, for bring professionals into it who would advocate introduction of religious contents in public schools.</td>
