 These mechanisms include cell-cell recognition and taret-dependent induction of the presynaptic secretion machinery. Our studies investigate synapse formation of identified motoneurons following nerve injury in vivo and following isolation of neurons into cell culture. Since the synapse is the site of most interneuronal communication within the nervous system, an understanding of the development, regeneration and plasticity of these connections is crucial to an ultimate appreciation of neural integration and brain function. In our studies of synaptic specificity, we take advantage of the accessibility of neurons within the buccal nervous system of the American pond snail, Helisoma trivolvis. The central focus of my research program investigates the role of target-recognition and synaptic induction in the formation of neuromuscular synapses.</td>
