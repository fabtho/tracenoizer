 If you don't see the animation above, you need a Flash plug-in. World Times Domain shortcuts, weather info, or map of a particular city. This pages are hand-coded, DHTML and tables have been extensively used to control cell-by-cell placement and appearance of elements; fonts, sizes and colors individually selected and coded for optimum effect; graphics individually toned for greatest impact and optimized to minimize load times. It is impossible to predict the effects of viewing this site on the near-infinite range of possible PC configurations, on equally different range of internet speed, as well as wide variety of Web browsers. On the other hand, if you'd like to know more about my view of things, then Movies, Tesla and Amsterdam are more appropriate pages.</td>
