 Zoran's contributions include the control processor, the encoder, and decoder technology optimized for recording and playback in the new PVR system. This new three-chip PVR architecture enables cost effective PVR solutions through chip level integration and a glueless construction that enhances system performance. The new system delivers recording and playback of analog and digital TV streams with a rich feature set that includes DVD decoder trick modes for an enhanced home theater experience. "We believe the market leaders in consumer electronics want to quickly and easily add PVR, caching and other exciting functions to their new devices today. We teamed with Zoran Corporation to create new PVR architectures that provide our consumer electronics customers with a richer feature set at a lower cost point than any other existing platform," said Richard Johnson, President and CEO of CacheVision.</td>
