 4) Astronomical Imaging - CCD images of young galactic clusters are obtained at various observatories in order to study the form and variation of the initial mass function in these regions. Additionally associated nebulae have been studied using a tunable liquid crystal filter coupled to a cooled CCD camera. 5) Digital Radiography - A phosphor screen lens coupled to a coded CCD camera is the basis of an X-ray imaging system that has been assembled and tested at the University of Rochester Medical Center. The system uses a large format 2048 x 2048 CCD chip to record fluorescence from a standard mammographic screen. The system offers direct digital images at rates superior to that of film, higher dynamic range and less expense.</td>

 It's the emblem of Nato's technical (and, by implication, moral) superiority, the martial equivalent of the television zapper. In the absence of the hero-warrior and the shared values he would embody, television, the consumer society's storyteller supreme, has been floundering in the attempt to construct a narrative that makes sense to us. Images of suffering slide into our entertainment system and are neutralised. Fabrication of Racak massacre, report from French media Diana Johnstone Who is William Walker.
