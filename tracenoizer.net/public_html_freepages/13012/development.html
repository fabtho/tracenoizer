 I was born and grew up in Yugoslavia , where I also earned a B. degree in electrical engineering from University of Belgrade, Belgrade. My research concerns development and application of control theoretic methods for increased performance of switched reluctance motors (SRM). The SRM has many advantages over other types of electric motors, including constructional simplicity, low cost, high degree of fault tolerance and efficiency. However the acceptance of SRM drives in industrial applications is limited in large part by simplistic control strategies which do not yield acceptable levels of torque and speed ripple, and by noise produced by the motor.</td>
