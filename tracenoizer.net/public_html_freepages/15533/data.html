 . The complete Drosophila life cycle will be analyzed. The first set of data from this project is available in a companion database to the paper below. We hope that others will use a similar reference sample so that our data can be compared directly. cDNAs Available from Research Genetics These cDNAs can be used to construct your own DNA microarrays.</td>

 They also allow us to rapidly survey genetic variation in populations. Using DNA microarrays, we have been performing comparative analyses of gene expression among Drosophila strains and species that have adapted to different environments, or that are at various stages of genetic isolation from one another. For example, close interaction between programmers, database developers and molecular biologists has allowed us to create carefully designed whole-genome Drosophila microarrays and a powerful database to store and disseminate microarray data. In collaboration with other groups, we are working toward expanding the utility of this database to a broader community (see the Yale Microarray Database). We also will need to develop new tools that allow us to analyze and visualize large amounts of functional genomic data.</td>
