 8 Kitaen, Finely trade accusations Time to lobby Tippett to take over in Dallas . . In fact, his initial year in that position remarkably qualified as the most successful across-the-board year in the history of athletics at Notre Dame. He brought a combined 18 years of experience in those positions with him to his assignment at Notre Dame. Then four teams during the spring semester achieved their highest in-season averages ever.</td>

 Granted, White has made a couple of high-profile mistakes. His most serious gaffe was in giving an undeserving Bob Davie a contract extension. This was done despite the fact that Davie had yet to prove himself a consistent winner. But thinking that Davie had turned the corner after going 9 and 2 during the 2000 regular season and wanting to establish continuity within the program, White took a calculated gamble that Davie would continue to produce results. Alas, this wasn't the case but to White's credit, he quickly recognized Davie's limitations and wasn't hesitant about folding a bad hand.</td>
