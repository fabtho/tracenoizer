In the developing world, income growth has fared even worse. Ricardo argued that nations would reap the most benefits if they specialized in the products in which they had the greatest advantage or least disadvantage compared to other countries. As England was better at weaving cloth and Portugal at making wine, for example, both would gain more if they concentrated on what they did best and then traded the products with each other than if each tried to produce both goods domestically. In the 1840s, Ricardo's followers promoted the opening of British grain markets in part as a way to alleviate the Great Famine in Ireland.">
