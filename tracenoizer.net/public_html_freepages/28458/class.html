 So, in this fourth and final installment, he will present a framework based on the dynamic proxy classes in the Java 2 Platform, Version 1. This framework will make creating SOAP clients just as easy and intuitive as creating SOAP services. A dynamic proxy class is a class that implements a list of interfaces specified at runtime. This proxy can then be used as if it actually implemented these interfaces. In other words, any method on any of these interfaces can be called directly on the proxy -- after properly type-casting it, of course.</td>
