In searching for these answers, you won't have to look too far before you stumble upon SOAP. SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) -- a wire protocol that uses XML for data encoding -- takes Java's platform independence and portability to a higher level of interoperability. In Part 2 of this four-part series on SOAP I introduced you to Apache SOAP, an implementation of the SOAP specification that easily creates SOAP-based applications. Using that implementation, you built two simple HelloWorld services and clients that invoked the sayHelloTo() method on those services.">

 It will use multiple years of the National Postsecondary Student Aid Survey (NPSAS). . Agenda items will include updates from the work groups on the Common Core of Data (CCD) (improving the count of vocational schools), National Survey of Postsecondary Faculty (NSOPF) (drafting a module for 2-year faculty), and Education Longitudinal Survey (ELS) (designing the 12th-grade survey instruments). We will also discuss key findings from recent reports, including those that have contributed to the ongoing National Assessment of Vocational Education (NAVE). A detailed agenda will be sent to TRP members soon.</td>

 When you add a record in the DNS console, the DNS server will update the zone files automatically. First, the DNS server will keep the information in the memory for some time. If you want to force the server to make changes to the zone files immediately, right-click either the DNS Server or the zone in the DNS console and select Update Server Data File. While we don't recommend manually modifying zone files, if you must do so, be sure to know what you're doing. This causes the DNS server to reload all information from the zone file.</td>

 Last year, 27 percent of freshmen failed English, according to the Consortium on Chicago School Research. That percentage is down six points since 1994, a period during which the percentage of freshmen scoring at or above national norms in reading rose 15 points. In the academic quarter ending in January, 44 percent of all Chicago high school students failed one or more courses, School Board data show. The problem, teachers say, is that the kids lack motivation. Researchers and social welfare professionals who deal with city kids agree.</td>
