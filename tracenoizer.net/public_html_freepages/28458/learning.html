 . Collaborative Research Network - Resources Different worlds. Technology-mediated classroom learning and students' social practices with new technologies in home and community settings Colin Lankshear and Michele Knobel Faculty of Education, Queensland University of Technology Introduction This paper presents theorised 'snapshots' involving seven Australian school students of different ages and backgrounds as they engage in social practices mediated by electronic technologies in school and out of school settings. Its theoretical frame embraces larger social, economic, cultural and policy contexts and processes. Our aim is to indicate some of the complexities facing educators who are seriously concerned with issues of equitable education in the electronic age.</td>

 The students were also asked if the prospect of their writing being published on the Web influenced their work - they all stated that they primarily aimed to produce the best standard of writing irrelevant of its being put on the Web, though some found the possibility of their work being open to public criticism a little daunting. The Explorations module took up more staff time both in preparing material for students, and delivering the course (students taking Adopt an Author largely work independently). Although the module provided a guided introduction to research methods, some of the students found the shift towards independent learning challenging. Although the course has been discontinued, this was largely due to staffing problems. Effects on the teaching process Initial lectures and seminars for Adopt an Author focusses on the Web-based material.</td>
