Agenda items will include updates from the work groups on the Common Core of Data (CCD) (improving the count of vocational schools), National Survey of Postsecondary Faculty (NSOPF) (drafting a module for 2-year faculty), and Education Longitudinal Survey (ELS) (designing the 12th-grade survey instruments).
