 The following schema shows a very simple CORBA service, which allows clients to get and store the name associated with an email address. For the purposes of this example, we won't worry about modifying or deleting an existing user. idl We start by declaring a module for our address book system (modules can be mapped to Java packages). Inside the module, we declare our interfaces and the exceptions they can raise. Since its such as simple system, the methods of the interface will only return a string, but we can create more complex return values if needed.</td>

 Gregg Tavarres has produced a very detailed page on using a Japanese WinCE machine with handwritten kanji recognition and JWPce. The Tokyo PC Users Group has an interesting site, and has informative meetings and articles. for users of my favourite operating system, Linux, there is the Tokyo Linux Users Group (TLUG). Sean Nelson has a particularly useful page on enabling Japanese support in Windows 2000. Nobby Miura has a valuable Internet in Japanese page, with tips for email, etc.</td>

 Make sure to keep the conversation on-topic and appropriate if you don't want your thread to be locked. If you post an obscene topic or continuously post topics that aren't appropriate, you will be banned. This means that you can no longer reply to any thread in the entire Jedi Council forum system, not just the Fan Films forum. Depending on the severity, you can be banned from a few days to permanently. A username ban is one that prevents any replies under a certain username from being made.</td>
