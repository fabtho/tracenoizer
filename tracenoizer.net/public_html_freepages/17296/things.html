 If you want more information about the 100LX, or the newer 200LX, try the TechNet Palmtop Web page. (These days I mainly use my Palmtop as a portable Japanese dictionary. ) Odd Things A link to my Work_in_progress page, where I experiment with HTML thingos. A link to the Bill Sux page, which I constructed from some email from a joke list. A URL for a Telnet window back to my mail server, as these things are sometimes useful.</td>

 We in the Goddess's Own Country live in such times as Mencken or Twain would have given limbs to chronicle. '' It is, to begin with, one of the most intelligent magazines being published, in a league with the New York Review of Books or The Economist. Second, its writers are all leftists of a sensibly old-fashioned sort, not above noticing things like poverty and the lock-out in Decatur. Third, they have no patience with cant, and in fact tremendously enjoy puncturing reputations and pretense and fooling the all-too-gullible. This puts them in a bit of quandry, since the circumstances which let them make use of their considerable talents --- and we have not seen their like since the glory days of the Partisan Review --- are the ones which set at naught all their political hopes, and tempt them to writing apocalypses.</td>
