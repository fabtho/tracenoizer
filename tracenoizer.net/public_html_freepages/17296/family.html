 Stunned to his soul, Earl heads for Chicago, where he finds that Ray not only knows his secret but wants nothing to do with him. Slowly, however, in this marvelously drawn script by Billy Bob Thornton and Tom Epperson, the two brothers find common ground. The theme--about discovering a family bond where none existed before--works better than the story-telling, which is a shade predictable. Watch for a great supporting performance by actress Irma Hall, who plays the aunt of both men. --Marshall Fine --This text refers to the VHS Tape edition.</td>

 Books that children relate to can help them to so lve problems by seeing how situations and circumstances are dealt with by others. Books can also inspire children to pursue goals because someone like them did the same thing. Family, home life and cultural backgrounds and lifestyles vary with different ethnic groups. Children must to be able to find books that focus on their ethnic identities and backgrounds to help develop the sense of self so important to growing up and to the appreciation of others and the world around them. Many of these bibliographies are over ten years old, but they are included to provide a more thorough look at this body of literature.</td>
