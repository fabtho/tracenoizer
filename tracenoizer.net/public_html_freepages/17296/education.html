Often a family intervention occurs in the person's home, others in the leader's office. Sometimes a great deal of family education takes place before the intervention, in others it takes place afterward.

 Along the way I collected an MBA, which convinced me I didn't want to be manager, so in 1983 I joined a consultancy as a communications consultant. Lots of travelling, stress and missing my family led me to move to academia, and in 1985 I took a position of Principal Lecturer at the old Chisholm Institute of Technology. In 1990, as part of the "unification" of the tertiary education system in Australia, Chisholm merged with Monash University. My position was converted to the university equivalent (Associate Professor), and I took up a fixed-term appointment as (full) Professor while I was heading a department. Our eldest daughter, Katrina (30) lives nearby in Surrey Hills; she is a Suzuki teacher too, having done a BA in violin at the VCA.</td>
