 From 1989 through 1992, I was a Research Scientist and Lecturer in the Computer Science Department at Rice. Before this, I was a graduate and undergraduate student at Rice, completing my Ph. (1982) with a double major in Computer Science and Mathematical Sciences. As a graduate student at Rice, my advisor was Willy Zwaenepoel. As an undergraduate, I was a member of Lovett College, one of eight residential colleges at Rice; I was also a Faculty Associate at Lovett for two years before leaving Rice for CMU in 1992.</td>
