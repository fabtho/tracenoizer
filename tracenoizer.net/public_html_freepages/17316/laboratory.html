 The focus will be on effects at the organismal level and above (populations and communities), but will also include effects within organisms. Environmental change will also be discussed within the context of economic, political, and social factors. Meets core requirement for a non-laboratory science course. Hay Introduction to the science of biology designed to meet science requirements of non-science majors. Course content and emphasis will vary with instructor.</td>

 His dissertation dealt with radiative transfer calculations of the sodium D lines in the atmospheres of cool dwarf stars. Boice developed and maintained a Mie scattering code for investigating the propagation of laser light in various battlefield environments. While a postdoctoral fellow with the Theoretical Division at Los Alamos National Laboratory he modified and extended a computer model of comet comae. Boice is currently continuing his comet research to assimilate information from ground-based observations and spacecraft instrumentation to develop a better global understanding of comets. Observational astronomy is another area of his expertise.</td>
