 This combined conference will represent one of the world's premier research forums in high-performance object-oriented computation. Preceding the JavaOne 2001 conference, Java Grande - ISCOPE will also enable the attendees to expose themselves to the latest in basic Java Technology. Research papers should describe work that advances the current technology or understanding of concepts and problems. Papers which demonstrate object-oriented technology in the context of an actual application are highly-encouraged. For all types of papers, references and comparisons to existing work will be significant criteria in evaluating the contribution.</td>

 Boice developed and maintained a Mie scattering code for investigating the propagation of laser light in various battlefield environments. While a postdoctoral fellow with the Theoretical Division at Los Alamos National Laboratory he modified and extended a computer model of comet comae. Boice is currently continuing his comet research to assimilate information from ground-based observations and spacecraft instrumentation to develop a better global understanding of comets. Observational astronomy is another area of his expertise. Boice has been a visiting astronomer at Kitt Peak National Observatory (NOAO) where he obtained echelle spectra for his dissertation using the Mayall 4-meter telescope, Arecibo Observatory (NAIC) where he was co-discoverer of a radio flare on a late-type giant star (alpha Ceti), and Sacramento Peak Observatory (NOAO) where he observed solar plage spectra and Ellerman bombs on the Tower telescope and sunspots in white light.</td>
