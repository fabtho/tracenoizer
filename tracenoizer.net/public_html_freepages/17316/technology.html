 For the same payload size, SEP can shorten interplanetary cruise times and require fewer planetary swingby gravity assists than a chemical propulsion system. Solar Array Because of the ion propulsion system power requirements, DS1 needs a high-power solar array and this is another one of the technologies to be tested. It is known as SCARLET II, which stands for solar concentrator arrays with refractive linear element technology. This solar concentrator pair uses cylindrical lenses to concentrate sunlight onto a strip of photovoltaic cells. A relatively small solar array area is actually covered by solar cells.</td>
