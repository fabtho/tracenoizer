 Guidelines for Writing System Software and Tools Requirements Guidelines for Writing System Software and Tools Requirements for Parallel and Clustered Computers A collaborative effort involving both users and developers of system software These documents present the findings of a national task force convened in 1995, on the recommendation of the Second Pasadena Workshop on System Software and Tools for High-Performance Computing Environments. The group was charged with establishing the basic requirements for a software infrastructure to support parallel applications development. Those requirements must be representative of the high-performance computing (HPC) user community as a whole. It must also be possible to implement the requirements in a robust and consistent fashion across a full range of parallel and clustered computing platforms. In the interests of expediency, the requirements must be implementable without significant new technological development.</td>
