 "(C)" as code-word for artificial life behaviors which thrive in the subcutaneous layers of digital consciousness. Broadcasting from the Internet studios of Pseudo T. A soundtrack consisting primarily of "artificial life music" will go out live over "real audio", "Internet phone" (or equivalent technology). Texts will be generated by participating members in the chat window, and simultaneously translated into digitally generated vocalization to be added into the score.

 Fakeshop will produce a live event in conjunction with the 2000 Biennial Exhibition. Courtesy Catherine Clark GalleryOuija 2000 was created by Ken Goldberg in collaboration with engineers and designers at the University of California, Berkeley, where Goldberg is an industrial engineering professor. Visitors to the website manipulate a real Ouija board, located in Goldberg's lab, by moving the mouse on their computer. A live streaming video of the board's progress is visible on the web page. Equating occult mysticism with the web, the artist slyly critiques some of the more mystifying aspects of new technologies and satirizes our increasing reliance on the Internet as a source of information.</td>
