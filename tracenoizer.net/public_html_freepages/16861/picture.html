 ARCHIVE Car - Cg Car of Dreams (1935) John Mills is the all-singin', all-dancin' juve lead of this antique musical in which he woos the girl of his dreams by giving her a Rolls-Royce and posing as a chauffeur. Musicals don't get much sillier (and songs don't get much worse) but there's a lot of fun to be had here. Robertson Hare steals the picture, particularly with his trombone testing sequence. Poor lad Stewart Granger and rich lass Anne Crawford grow up loving each other, but nasty cad Dennis Price also has the hots for Crawford. Granger asks for Crawford's hand but insists he won't marry her until he has made his fortune.</td>

 That Bill Frain did not survive to enjoy the substantial scientific successes achieved by the HISCALE investigation saddens us all and reminds us of the imperative to produce the maximum return to science in honor of those who did not survive to experience it personally. We dedicate this document to the memory of Bill Frain. HISCALE Team Picture HISCALE Team Roster Return to HISCALE Data Analysis Handbook Table of Contents.
