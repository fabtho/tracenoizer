 . The following preface gives a brief overview of the Ulysses mission in addition to the procedures used to create, distribute, and archive the data that originates from the HISCALE instrument on the Ulysses spacecraft. The primary purpose of the Ulysses mission, a joint venture between the European Space Agency (ESA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), is to explore the inner heliosphere of the sun away from the ecliptic plane. This mission is unique in that the spacecraft will travel over the solar poles, exploring regions of the sun in a manner not previously attempted. The project began in 1977 and was originally called the Out-of-Ecliptic mission.</td>

 The author is apparently confusing it with 'nuclear winter' -- the climatological effect of a large-scale nuclear warhead exchange. But it is NOT correct to speak of a 'nuclear winter' in the aftermath of a large meteor impact. Surely NASA can't be so influential as to completely cover up the considerable evidence re the dangers as included in Karl Grossman's book THE WRONG STUFF. Prior to July 4, 1999, reader comments were posted on individual stories. We had put the beginning of the Universe at a mere 15 to 20 million years ago, when of course it should have read that the Big Bang occurred 15 to 20 billion years ago.</td>
