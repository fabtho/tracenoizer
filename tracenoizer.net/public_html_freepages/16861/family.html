 A new public room for the Division of Special Programs in Lewisohn Hall was dedicated in memory of Ward H. Dennis, dean of the School of General Studies from 1977 to his death in 1992, in a ceremony last Friday. Members of his family were on hand as Provost Jonathan R. Cole and Frank Wolf, dean of the Division of Special Programs, spoke about Dennis' long-standing commitment to bringing the best a major research university has to offer to qualified people from all sections of society and from all parts of the world. Cole said the opening of the room completed the University's effort to recognize Dennis' achievements.</td>

 Their beautiful designs have been around since 1916. I have built many Kuempel clocks for my customer's including the grandfather clocks to the right. If you are looking to purchase a new Grandfather Wall or Mantle clock, or need a family heirloom repaired and serviced, please contact me. I am available for house-calls and consultations in the Northern California area. I invite you to browse through my Picture Album to get an idea of the work I have done over the years.</td>
