 Dennis, dean of the School of General Studies from 1977 to his death in 1992, in a ceremony last Friday. Members of his family were on hand as Provost Jonathan R. Cole and Frank Wolf, dean of the Division of Special Programs, spoke about Dennis' long-standing commitment to bringing the best a major research university has to offer to qualified people from all sections of society and from all parts of the world. Cole said the opening of the room completed the University's effort to recognize Dennis' achievements. He recalled that before Dennis died Columbia had named the Junior Faculty Development Fund in his honor, to reflect his championing the interests of junior faculty in the arts and sciences.</td>

 -- if so, how'd it get onto the surface, being as water "freezes pure". (Other than inclusions, which would need a disturbant like wind -- which there isn't there. I have been conducting field research in Iceland for the past two years. I am specifically working on the catastrophic flood deposits from jokulhlaups, these are glacial outburst floods. It is quite common to observe small rocks and boulders with percussion marks.</td>
