 After I retired from a career in banking in 1997, I devoted more and more time to my "hobby" until it became my new occupation. shop behind my home in beautiful Redding CA, to house my clock building and repair work. I hope to continue to repair and build many variaties of mechanical clocks for my customers for years to come. Their beautiful designs have been around since 1916. I have built many Kuempel clocks for my customer's including the grandfather clocks to the right.</td>

 The only "mystery" is why an otherwise correct and rigorous science page would endorse this rigamarole. Don't you realize that you are legitimizing claptrap by recommending such a title as "science". I am dismayed and disappointed, and I hope you will reconsider. It was a pure editorial failure on our part, as ez strives always to be a place for legitimate science only. While there is a wide range of interpretations within that concept, the book mentioned is clearly outside the realm and, unlike good science fiction, promotes unworthy ideas as fact.</td>
