 Program and project management, engineering support, financial, and scientific components of the HISCALE investigation have all been importantly aided via the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the European Space Research and Technology Center. The persons involved are too numerous to list exhaustively here. Essential to the success of the HISCALE investigation was the work of Bill Frain, our project manager at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. That Bill Frain did not survive to enjoy the substantial scientific successes achieved by the HISCALE investigation saddens us all and reminds us of the imperative to produce the maximum return to science in honor of those who did not survive to experience it personally. We dedicate this document to the memory of Bill Frain.</td>
