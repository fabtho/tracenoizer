Six hours into the flight, the spacecraft was separated from the shuttle. The spacecraft was sent to Jupiter into an out of ecliptic orbit for a technique called Gravity Assist Maneuver. The spacecraft arrived at Jupiter in February, 1992 and used the planet's immense gravity to swing it back toward the south pole of the sun. Ulysses was originally scheduled to be a five year mission, with the first south polar pass occurring in June-October 1994 and the north polar pass occurring June-September 1995.">

 Comet observers will find the Comet Observing page a useful resource, including the complete text of the online observation logbooks for Hale-Bopp and Hyakutake (which have been imported from the old site). Not surprisingly, the Links of Interest page provides a gateway to many magazines, organizations and observatories around the globe. The Minor Planets page contains some exciting links to resources that will assist you in searches or observations. The Online Resources page contains references to some of the most exciting online tools, catalogues and resources. We do have other interests -- visit our Dolphin Interaction page.</td>

 not that i'm generally a fan of prizes; but because this is such a crucial technology in the development of space industrialisation that anything which can fast-track its development would be valuable. It's worth noting that the same basic technology could also be adapted as Earth-impacting asteroid mitigation strategy. something we're going to have to develop sooner or later) The fourth challenge would be to develop propulsion systems capable of using local raw materials (probably light for power; with hydrogen as a fuel - although mass drivers using slag from the materials processing systems are certainly conceivable) to nudge the mined asteroid (with or without gravity assist manouevres) towards Earth orbit (assuming Earth orbit actually is the mine's final destination, of course). These thrusters don't have to be powerful; but they do need to be longlived (industrial strength Deep Space 1s, if you like), because the most cost effective way of running this operation is for the mined asteroid to reach its destination as close to the time when its raw materials have been completely processed as possible (the exception to this statement would be NEOs such as 1999 AN10, which make regular passes through terrestrial space. under these circumstances, one could aim to make deliveries of processed material on every flyby).</td>
