 After I retired from a career in banking in 1997, I devoted more and more time to my "hobby" until it became my new occupation. shop behind my home in beautiful Redding CA, to house my clock building and repair work. I hope to continue to repair and build many variaties of mechanical clocks for my customers for years to come. Their beautiful designs have been around since 1916. I have built many Kuempel clocks for my customer's including the grandfather clocks to the right.</td>

 Surely your writers know that anatomically-modern humans only left caves for village-centred agricultural groups about 10,000 years ago and that they were no more hairy, slobbering etc than you or me. Yes, Neanderthals were short, stocky and beetlebrowed; so are a great many people alive today who don't necessarily communicate via grunts. You do your site's reputation and your readers' education no service at all to continue to push the hackneyed image of Neanderthals as drooling, shambling, idiots. Many readers don't know the truth about our ancestors. I visited explorezone to learn more about the Perseid meteor shower, and found a wealth of information in a beautiful format, plus great links.</td>
