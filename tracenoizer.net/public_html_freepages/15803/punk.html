 They were in fact a great band, who came across with stray cat guitar riffs, slutty girl group harmonies and bronx cheer lyrics. The Dolls were stars simply because they said they were. The more famous ultimately was Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers, but for a while there it was a close thing when the New York band, Johnny Thunders and The Heartbreakers moved to the UK at the time of the original punk explosion. Even before Britain had seen or heard the band, the Heartbreakers were near legends. They were included as part of the first ever punk package tour, which featured the Pistols, the Clash, and the Damned.</td>

'In Cold Blood' is an unflinching account of a unique guitarist whose drug problems often overshadowed his considerable style and talent, and whose influence on such bands as The Sex Pistols and Guns N' Roses is still resonant. Seven tracks are alternative, unreleased mixes from the recording sessions of the remarkable 1977 Johnny Thunders and The Heartbreakers album, 'LAMF'.</td>
