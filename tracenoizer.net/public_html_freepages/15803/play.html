 The Reign was just a bunch of kids from Johnny's neighborhood sweating out this raw music. Side B of this record is an unknown band performing 'I've Had Enough'. You really can't hear any of Johnny's trademark guitar sound on this tune as he must have just learned how to play. The cover photographs of a very young JT are great. I found it interesting to hear the first time but I won't play it much more.</td>

 Topics dealt with here include poison flour and dead barbers. A couple o' years ago I had a short talk with Long Gone John axin' him about the posability of some kinda Gizmos retrospective; after he wondered how much such a concept might sell, I said that it probably would be along the lines of his Child Mollestors releases to which he replyed "those are my worst sellers . It's prolly hard to get this band if you don't "get" the wasteland that was the mid 70s, bands like this couldn't play by numbers 'cause there were no numbers to play by. With Mariconda at the controls and Walter Daniels on harp, this might be the best of it's kind since the Oblivians' 'Soul Food' and that ain't no mean feat. Comes complete with extensive linernotes by the man himself and the ussual Norton attention to detail, file under Essential.</td>

 Their trashy NY sound definitely launched "punk" as did their former manager Malcom McLaren. McLaren worked the bugs out while managing the NY DOLLS before getting it right with the SEX PISTOLS. Johnny Thunders took Doll's drummer, Jerry Nolan with him to form THE HEARTBREAKERS, who taught all the punks how to play. htm HANOI ROCKS - Inspired by the NEW YORK DOLLS glam, they added elements of THE CLASH, GEN X and Saloon to their music. Their albums have all been re-released on CD by GUNS N ROSES, Uzi Suicide label.</td>
