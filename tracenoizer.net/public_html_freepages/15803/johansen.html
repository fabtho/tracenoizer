 After a trip in 1969 to London to check out the wildand heady music scene there, Johnny returned to New York with a renewed determination to fulfill his rock n roll star aspirations. Johnny Genzale became Johnny Volume, who evolved into, Johnny Thunders. He joined a small time group called Actress, by a friend and frontman David Johansen. Actress at the time featured bass player Arthur Harold Kane, Columbian drummer Billy Murcia, and Cairo born Sylvain Sylvain on rhythm guitar. It was Sylvain who suggested they should re-name themselves The Dolls.</td>

 In 1969 after a sojourn to London to check out the hedonistic and heady music scene there, Johnny returned to New York with a renewed determination to fulfill his rock n roll star aspirations. Johnny Genzale became Johnny Volume, who soon evolved into Johnny Thunders. Thunders was recruited into a small time outfit called Actress, by a friend and frontman David Johansen. Actress at the time featured alcoholic bass player Arthur Harold Kane, Columbian drummer Billy Murcia, and Cairo born Sylvain Sylvain on rhythm guitar. It was Sylvain who suggested they should re-name themselves The Dolls, and Thunders who tacked on the New York prefix - thus The New York Dolls were born.</td>

 Blasting out of the gutters of NYC with more attitude and snarling aggression than had been seen before, the Dolls personified rock'n'roll decadence. Unfortunately, due to industry indifference, bad management and a lack of promotion--the Dolls went over like a stinkbomb at the senior prom. But their charismatic lead guitarist, Johnny Thunders, stood out in a band that included snot-voiced lead singer David Johansen and talented songwriter Sylvain Sylvain. When Thunders and drummer Jerry Nolan quit the band due to drugs and ego problems, Thunders was free to front The Heartbreakers and record solo albums like the stunning "So Alone" (1978). Filled with excellent photographs and the candid remembrances of family, friends and bandmates--"In Cold Blood" is a fascinating look at the public and private sides of one of rock'n'roll's greatest heroes and biggest tragedies.</td>
