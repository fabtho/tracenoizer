 Even before Britain had seen or heard the band, the Heartbreakers were near legends. They were included as part of the first ever punk package tour, which featured the Pistols, the Clash, and the Damned. 1977 saw the band play every major rock venue in London, before releasing their debut LP on Track Records. Thunders pursued a solo career, and an ever increasing heroin habit that he would maintain for the next decade. The Heartbreakers reformed in 1984, and from this tour resulted in various live albums and bootlegs.</td>

 Not everything they put on is to my taste (far from it), then again, few are as choosy as I am. That said, with upcomin' gigs by the Knoxville Girls, New Bomb Turks and Supersuckers I ain't complainin'. So what made me leave the house for the long track to the Ekko last week. Supportin' was local combo Misselijk, who played their set sober (a first, me thinks), an thus didn't sound half as bad as they usually do. They still sound way too much like some post Bad Religion band for me to enjoy (or for them to admit), but mayhaps their new found sobriety might lead them to a more rockin' route.</td>

 An enema or an electro-shock session was clearly in order. Somehow, every young woman from a distance seemed to be her, and I persisted with the delusions. Inside, the track and time board tiles flip flopped every few minutes. Prestige, journalistic obligations, and Johnny Thunders would not wait were my departure to be delayed. I was not totally prepared, but enough to capture what minimal documentation there would be time for.</td>
