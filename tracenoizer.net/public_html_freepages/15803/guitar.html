 The Reign was just a bunch of kids from Johnny's neighborhood sweating out this raw music. Side B of this record is an unknown band performing 'I've Had Enough'. You really can't hear any of Johnny's trademark guitar sound on this tune as he must have just learned how to play. The cover photographs of a very young JT are great. I found it interesting to hear the first time but I won't play it much more.</td>

 Born John Anthony Genzale on July 15, 1952, Johnny spent his early years on the streets of Queens NY hoping to become another Micky Mantle. An introduction to music at an early age interupted his promising baseball career. While only in his teens Johnny was fast becoming an accomplished guitar player. Johnny drew inspiration to form his first band in the late 60's and called it Johnny and The Jaywalkers. After a trip in 1969 to London to check out the wildand heady music scene there, Johnny returned to New York with a renewed determination to fulfill his rock n roll star aspirations.</td>

 He lived a dangerous life and eventually came to represent what most people would rather forget when it comes to popular entertainment. Sure, they may want to read William Burroughs or go and see ' Trainspotting' but media tourists rarely want to tangle with the real deal, chossing instead the darkness of the cinema or the printed word, so they can walk the same streets without having to cross through the shadows that exist there. Johnny didn't set out to be a dope fiend artiste rulling the roost of slum city rock, the needle haze as much a part of his performance as the guitar playing. He wanted to be as great as Presley before the army, or Sinatra in his prime, and sometimes he was. As the condemned man of rock 'n' roll, Johnnny wasn't always as oblivious as casual observers might have believed or critics presumed but he wasn't strong enough to escape, either.</td>
