 Think Debbie Harry hijacks THE MUFFS and takes the REZILLOS for a ride. If OASIS knew how to rock and listened to CHEAP TRICK or ELO, they'd be Petrol. I can't describe it but you better check it out for yourselves. RATBOY - What can I say about the man-rat that he won't tell you himself at the site. Only that he lives on a street called Rock and Roll and that he's played with just about everyone.</td>

 This was the beginning of the end in a nine year saga, for Christ's sake. Every Thunders fan within a hundred mile radius (those worth their Dolls badges, anyway) would be in attendance, and besides, Lech was paying for the room. Something seemed to be afoot, and I wondered if it would be a good idea to remind them to check my stuff. But the train started moving again, and arrived within 30 minutes. Toronto is a beautiful town, made me feel good just to be there.</td>
