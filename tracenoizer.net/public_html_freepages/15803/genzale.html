 Many tales have been told of his shooting up on stage sticking needles into his gutar strings with each fix or noding out and falling face down into his food.

 GRAPES OF WRATH All The Things I Wasn't (2000) An uncharacteristically pushy, sitar-laden remake that wittily evokes The Beatles' "She Said She Said". A perfect complement to the new reunion single, "Black Eye". THE REIGN Zippered Up Heart The long-lost first recording by 16-year-old Johnny Genzale, a. Johnny Thunders, who went on to fame and misfortune with the New York Dolls. A surprisingly accomplished slice of 1967 garage pop.</td>

 An introduction to music at an early age intercepted his promising baseball career as young Johnny was by now becoming an accomplished guitar player. In 1969 after a sojourn to London to check out the hedonistic and heady music scene there, Johnny returned to New York with a renewed determination to fulfill his rock n roll star aspirations. Johnny Genzale became Johnny Volume, who soon evolved into Johnny Thunders. Thunders was recruited into a small time outfit called Actress, by a friend and frontman David Johansen. Actress at the time featured alcoholic bass player Arthur Harold Kane, Columbian drummer Billy Murcia, and Cairo born Sylvain Sylvain on rhythm guitar.</td>

 To them, Johnny Thunders was just another junkie John Doe. Did you find there was much of a difference between the public myth of Johnny Thunders and the actual person. Then there was Johnny Genzale, the shy sweetheart who could be as sentimental as a valentine, and longed for a secure homelife. Do you think Johnny realised how much he meant to his fans. Johnny Thunders wanted to put on a good show, and he toured long and hard.</td>
