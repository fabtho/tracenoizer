 Skinny as a rail, pawn shop Gibson slung at crotch level, ciggie dangling from lips puckered with contempt, and decked out in black. Whoever invented the electric guitar surely had Thunders in mind when he was at the drawing board. Yet after so many years of treating his body like a toxic waste dump, the grim reaper finally caught up with Thunders, and on 23 April 1991, he was found dead in his New Orleans hotel room. Thunders was in New Orleans finalising long discussed plans for his new blues band, The Oddballs, and at the time of his death was attempting to fight his heroin addiction. It is important to mention that Thunders became a rock legend in spite of this addiction, rather than because of it.</td>

 Johnny Thunders was the last embodiment of a broken perfection that was true rebel culture before commerce married creativity and stifled the bride. . JOHNNY THUNDERS Dead-End Kid Nina Antonia on her Johnny Thunders bio by Chris Parcellin The early 1970s were an abysmal time for rock'n'roll. With only The Rolling Stones and a few cult groups like The Stooges and The MC5 pumping-out great hard rock sounds the stage was set for a revolution. Blasting out of the gutters of NYC with more attitude and snarling aggression than had been seen before, the Dolls personified rock'n'roll decadence.</td>

 Classic Jamaican DJ LP makes it's return to the vinyl shelves. From the almost surreal title tune on, this one jus' don't let up, an' if you can deal with this kinda stuff (before it became all mechanical 'n septic), this 'll hit you like a six pack o' Red Stripe. Topics dealt with here include poison flour and dead barbers. A couple o' years ago I had a short talk with Long Gone John axin' him about the posability of some kinda Gizmos retrospective; after he wondered how much such a concept might sell, I said that it probably would be along the lines of his Child Mollestors releases to which he replyed "those are my worst sellers . It's prolly hard to get this band if you don't "get" the wasteland that was the mid 70s, bands like this couldn't play by numbers 'cause there were no numbers to play by.</td>
