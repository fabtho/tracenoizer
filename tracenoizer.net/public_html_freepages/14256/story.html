 I've published four novels and more than fifty short stories. Sometimes it seems as though the stuff I write has the shelf life of lettuce. A story appears in a magazine and a month or so later it winds up in a corner of some basement -- or the landfill. ..</td>

 In fact, I hope someone is bringing the single-author collections being produced these days to the attention of libraries, since they provide the only way for most libraries to get some of the best work of today's leading authors. . The title story is the best known, and the most discussed, of all of them. And in fact it's not a new idea, but has been part and parcel of teleportation discussions for a long time now. Kelly combines it well with an alien sub- plot, though, and makes it interesting from that perspective.</td>

 NICE has a rich paleontologist in it, who returns from the Cretaceous period with an infant specimen of a new species of apatosaurus. Dinosaurs are of course a staple of time travel stories, so that was one reason I brought one in. My other reason was that the story is modeled on the screwball comedies of the 1930s. the leopard in BRINGING UP BABY, the snake in THE LADY EVE, the dog in THE AWFUL TRUTH. So I thought a dinosaur would add a new wrinkle to that old standard.</td>

 ' Included in the anthology he might have been, but whether it can be claimed that Kelly is concerned with cutting edge technology (and why should he be. The evidence provided in Think Like a Dinosaur suggests not. In the course of the transfer, the humans are copied, one of the copies travelling on to their stellar destination, while the other is exterminated before regaining consciousness - the hanen way of thinking (hence the story's title) allows no sentimentality over the eradication of the copy left behind. When Burr releases a traveller from a malfunctioning device, only to discover that transfer has actually been effected, he must end the life of the copy he can only view as human. They lead a life of carefree adolescent hedonism - a kind of SF take on Clueless - though even in this light-hearted vein Kelly does not lose sight of the fact that we need to believe and care about the characters, and their motivations, no matter how bizarre they might appear.</td>
