 . Insofar as I'm known at all, it's for my science fiction and fantasy. I've published four novels and more than fifty short stories. Sometimes it seems as though the stuff I write has the shelf life of lettuce. A story appears in a magazine and a month or so later it winds up in a corner of some basement -- or the landfill.</td>

 The other stories represent the best of Kelley's work, and make it available in a permanent form. This is the first volume from a new publisher, Golden Gryphon, and is a very well-produced volume. The single-author short story collection is not as dead as some claim. It isn't even relegated to the small press, as some would have--just this month sees the publication of a single-author collection by Ace, for example. In the case of THINK LIKE A DINOSAUR, what will work against its success is the fact that all but one of the stories in it were first published in ASIMOV'S, and most readers who know of Kelly are probably subscribers to that magazine.</td>
