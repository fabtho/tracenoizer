Andrew Kelly was the first of the family to leave his homeland. Mary and five of her adult children, arrived between 1852 and 1855, residing around the Tower Hill area. It is interesting to note here, that three of Andrew Kelly's children (Ellen, Patrick and Andrew) all married a Kelly.

 We hike in the summer, ski in the winter, and play at the park alot. We value most the ability to care about others and feel honesty and integrity are important in this goal. We have always envisioned our lives surrounded with several children. When it became clear this would not occur, we thought about adoption. We are good at parenting mostly because we love "little people".</td>
