 It includes certain tables of 'Assays' which were drawn up by Sir Isaac Newton. Volume I seems to have been based on Elert Kruse's Hamburgh Contorist.

Elliott first semester of my sophomore year, it made me punctual and taught me to put designs on the top of my scantrons. Good times, good memories, and good lessons that I will surely never forget.

Perhaps you remember looking out the window, daydreaming about what you really wanted to do (I did that a lot.

Aside from such problematic experiences, you may have memories of enthusiastic learning at different times in your life. Recall what you did, explored, and learned of your own accord.</td>
