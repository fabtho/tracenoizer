 . Insofar as I'm known at all, it's for my science fiction and fantasy. I've published four novels and more than fifty short stories. Sometimes it seems as though the stuff I write has the shelf life of lettuce. A story appears in a magazine and a month or so later it winds up in a corner of some basement -- or the landfill.</td>

 And in fact it's not a new idea, but has been part and parcel of teleportation discussions for a long time now. Kelly combines it well with an alien sub- plot, though, and makes it interesting from that perspective. The other stories represent the best of Kelley's work, and make it available in a permanent form. This is the first volume from a new publisher, Golden Gryphon, and is a very well-produced volume. The single-author short story collection is not as dead as some claim.</td>

 Maybe we're still worried that if they ever come back, we're toast. NICE has a rich paleontologist in it, who returns from the Cretaceous period with an infant specimen of a new species of apatosaurus. Dinosaurs are of course a staple of time travel stories, so that was one reason I brought one in. My other reason was that the story is modeled on the screwball comedies of the 1930s. the leopard in BRINGING UP BABY, the snake in THE LADY EVE, the dog in THE AWFUL TRUTH.</td>
