 Even if a failure of a technology causes termination of the mission, DS1 will still be considered a success if this failure can be diagnosed and the risk to future missions can be reduced. It is in these future missions that the real science return of DS1 will be found. However, this high-risk project also will attempt to return science data during its test flight. Although returning such data is not the primary goal of DS1, it is an important part of the overall demonstration that all technologies are consistent with a mission that conducts science. It is derived from designs for fast flybys of the outer planets.</td>
