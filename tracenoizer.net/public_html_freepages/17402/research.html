 After completing my doctoral work, I taught geology and mineralogy at Youngstown State University in Ohio and within a few months I began a postdoctoral program at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. I joined the science staff of the laboratory 2 years later and have been there ever since. My current research interests involve understanding the scattering behavior of electromagnetic radiation upon interaction with planetary surfaces. Professor Hakpe remains one of my research collaborators to this day. I wish all teachers could be like Miss Mueller, Mrs.</td>
