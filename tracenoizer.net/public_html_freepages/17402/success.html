 Many college library directors contact the program director as a direct result of their chief academic officer forwarding this letter to them. Chief academic officers want the library directors they hired to be successful. The success or failure of the library director can be a reflection on them, as well as a significant expenditure of time and money for the institution. Both usually have little formal training for their responsibilities. Both serve in somewhat isolated positions with few or no peers on campus with whom to consult or confide.</td>

 This created a very gentle but continuous period of thrust which propelled the spacecraft almost continuously during its interplanetary cruise. Within about a month after launch, DS1 completed most performance assessments of its payload. Even if a failure of a technology causes termination of the mission, DS1 will still be considered a success if this failure can be diagnosed and the risk to future missions can be reduced. It is in these future missions that the real science return of DS1 will be found. However, this high-risk project also will attempt to return science data during its test flight.</td>
