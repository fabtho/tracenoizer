 INSPASS (Airport); INSPASS (Land); PORTPASS (Dedicated Commuter Lane); and PORTPASS (Automated Permit Port). The first two use hand geometry; the last two voice verification since they are designed for use by people in vehicles. The difference between the last two is that the Dedicated Commuter Lane also uses a Radio Frequency tag affixed to the vehicle and gets the biometric as the vehicle is moving; the Automated Permit Port requires the vehicle to stop - we also back it up with a "Video Inspection System" that allows an inspector located at a different Port-of-Entry to video conference with the driver if the biometric fails to identify the traveler. All of our automated inspection systems use a "one-to-one" search; that is we attempt to verify a claimed identity. The person seeking admission to the United States presents a card which has an identifying number which corresponds to a record pertaining to an enrollee.</td>

 Document Installation (by Document Librarian) No document enters the document database until the document librarian checks that the submission is from a valid party, verifies that the template bibliography file has correct data, and assigns a unique document name to the document. At Cornell, the document librarian also verifies that the author has signed a copyright release document. This creates a directory in the file system and copies the PostScript file and bibliography file into the file system. install_tr takes two arguments, the handle or complete document id (including the publisher), and the temporary filename. After the document has been added, the librarian then uses the database maintenance tools to add the document's information to the Dienst index files.</td>
