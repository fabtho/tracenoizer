 Tertiary students can now learn at their own time, at their own pace and at their own place thanks to online courses that are springing up at universities and TAFE colleges across the nation, and the world. Meantime e-learning is the buzzword within Australian schools with the announcement of funds to further online learning opportunities in last week's state Budget. And while online learning should never completely replace face-to-face teaching according to those within the system, it is adding another dimension to the education of Australian children and adults. SCHOOL Every teacher and student at a NSW government school or TAFE college will have a personal email account in four years under a new State Government scheme. NSW Education Minister John Aquilina said the tender process for the introduction of individual e-learning accounts was close to completion with some to be available by the end of the year.</td>
