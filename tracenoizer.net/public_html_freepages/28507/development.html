<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" . Largaespada's laboratory is working to exploit insertional mutagenesis for cancer gene discovery. A mouse model of murine leukemia virus induced acute myeloid leukemia is being used to identify and characterize genes that have a role in myeloid leukemia development. Largaespada is focusing on genes that have a role in regulating Ras superfamily signaling, including the Neurofibromatosis type 1 gene and a new family of calcium and diacylglycerol regulated guanine nucleotide exchange factor genes. In addition, they are adapting a recently constructed transposon system for insertional mutagenesis in mouse somatic and germline cells.">

 The picture on the right shows postgraduates enjoying the library in 59 Oakfield Avenue. The course met the needs of unqualified workers employed in a variety of posts in the community. This was extended by the development of a Bachelor degree programme which is now offered on an in-service basis. This became the MPhil in English, Educational and Cultural Studies in 1999. The photograph opposite was taken on Graduation Day 1998.</td>
