 Referee for articles in German Studies Review (Fall, 1997) and Austrian History Yearbook (1999). . Because of the controversy over the incorporation of Joerg Haider's Freedom Party in the new Austrian government, I have prepared several short documents on the subject. A summary of my views on Haider and the FPOe developed in an email exchange with an Italian Journalist. A summary of the discusion about Haider's putative praise of the SS.</td>

 . In a surprise move Haider resigned from his position as party chairman. Austrian commentators see in the withdrawal a tactical move to increase his chances of a comeback at the next elections to the chancellor-position. Only hours after Haider made his statement, the Austrian Minister of Justice resigned. The 39 year-old climbed the career ladder slowly but steadily, wrote the Austrian News Agency APA.</td>

 We are very concerned about the way in which politicians like Joerg Haider become popular figures within Austrian society. . Joerg Haider, 49-year-old leader of the Austrian right- wing Freedom Party (FPOe), is on his way to becoming one of the most powerful political leaders in the Alpine State. At the very least, the FPOe will cast the swing vote. To his supporters, Haider seems to offer a fresh alternative to the two established parties.</td>
