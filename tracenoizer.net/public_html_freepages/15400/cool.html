 The fluid-enhanced design offers a dry, lasting cooling effect, combined with cushioning support. On hot show days, keep your Canine Cooler in an ice chest when it isn't in use. Then it will be ready in an instant to cool your dog. Here is a fan you can hang on your dog's crate or set on the floor. It's very quiet, has two speeds and moves quite a bit of air.</td>
