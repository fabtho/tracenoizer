 Hell, if ANY cooler keeps things cool enough, it could sound like a Boeing 747 and I'd probably still use it. Notables The Monster II is not an overly large HSF combination as the name might imply. I believe the name is marketed more towards it's cooling power than the size of the unit. I should note there were no problems with interference with the motherboard components during installation or afterwards so you don't have to worry about breaking out the hacksaw or soldering iron just to use it. Performance Installation and noise doesn't mean squat because cooling is everything right.</td>
