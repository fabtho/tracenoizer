<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" Taking advantage of the array of genetic tools available for Toxoplasma, we are attempting to identify genes encoding sporozoite-specific surface proteins through gene trapping strategies. These efforts supplement other conventional approaches to isolate cDNAs encoding sporozoite surface proteins and those proteins that are secreted into the unique sporozoite vacuole. Ultimately, gene knock-out strategies will be employed to determine whether a sporozoite-specific protein is essential to invasion and development. Coccidian parasites regulate growth in concert with their developmental program, thus, ensuring that parasite expansion occurs at the appropriate time and in the correct host cell. Coccidian growth is also usually self-limiting with the scale of expansion at each developmental stage predetermined by the parasite genetic program.">

 Thus a diffraction pattern is produced, the intensity of the reflected X-ray beam varying with the glancing angle q. (a) By using X-rays with a known wavelength and observing the angles of maximum intensity for the reflected beam, the spacings between the atoms in a crystal, the quantity d in equation (6), may be determined. Determine the spacings between the planes of nickel atoms. (b) Remarkably, electrons exhibit the same kind of diffraction pattern as do X-rays when reflected from a crystal; this provides a verification of de Broglie's prediction. The experiment performed by Davisson and Germer employed low energy electrons which do not penetrate the crystal.</td>

 Demo The Remote System Control (RSC) demo will provide you with an overview of Sun's RSC software that runs on a dedicated System Service Processor, and can be connected via PPP or dedicated ethernet. This feature provides a warning when hardware or software failures occur. The notification includes a detailed event log, so Systems Administrators can determine the cause of failures. This demo is available for all versions of Netscape Navigator, Netscape Communicator and Internet Explorer via the Java Plugin It will also work with Hotjava version 1. 6 Solaris 7 Solaris 8 Additionally, you can install the RSC 2.</td>
