 You can try any problem you like and if the problem is a little difficult you can get helpful hints by following the hints link. This web site has been established with support from Industry Canada and is located at St. Our thanks to the Waterloo Mathematics Foundation for their permission to adapt problems from the Canadian Mathematics Competitions.

 Each problem or sequence focuses on one mathematical idea and also connects that idea with others. Answers and solutions are provided, and many problems include hints. Each issue of the newsletter also features one special problem with commentary on its underlying mathematics, interesting features, and classroom uses. Finally, the newsletter includes selected comments submitted by our Web site visitors about particular mathematics problems. The work described in this website was supported by a generous grant from the National Science Foundation (ESI-9818735) to assist students and teachers with mathematics education.</td>

 Petersburg, and Yuri Matiyasevich's book Hilbert's Tenth Problem. .Mathematical Problems of David Hilbert The Mathematical Problems of David Hilbert About Hilbert's address and his 23 mathematical problems Hilbert's address of 1900 to the International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris is perhaps the most influential speech ever given to mathematicians, given by a mathematician, or given about mathematics. In it, Hilbert outlined 23 major mathematical problems to be studied in the coming century. Some are broad, such as the axiomatization of physics (problem 6) and might never be considered completed.</td>
