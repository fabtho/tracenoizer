That did not cause any particular problem, because including one sentence in an ad is not a great practical difficulty. If other developers who used BSD-like licenses had copied the BSD advertising clause verbatim--including the sentence that refers to the University of California--then they would not have made the problem any bigger. But, as you might expect, other developers did not copy the clause verbatim. The result is a plethora of licenses, requiring a plethora of different sentences.">
