 A graduate of the University of Texas in Austin, Elaine entered the classroom as a special education teacher in the 1970's. In the 1990's, Elaine created an adaptive education program and implemented a student teacher program in a cooperative effort with the University of West Florida. In the reciprocity agreement, Elaine received masters level course enrollment in exchange for training teachers in her classroom. She opted to take the masters level courses in the area of learning disabilities. Through the West Florida program and the actual classroom demands of her adaptive education program, Elaine learned to create curriculum that met the students' needs.</td>
