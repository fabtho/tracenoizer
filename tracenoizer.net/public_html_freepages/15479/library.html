Some of you have had difficulty getting to the library during opening hours; the Librarian has offered to get library books to people outside these times. Find the book you need in the catalogue and then mail the Librarian. Find the book(s) you want in the catalogue and then mail the Librarian.</td>

 Students may also use the World Wide Web to locate funding and research opportunities. Here, students will find links to the Community of Science, advising services, and research opportunities geared specifically towards them. Students may also visit Shields Library and access the UC Davis library Web site and online catalogue. Searches for "Research Grants--directories" and "Endowments--Directories" can prove fruitful. Some students use the Annual Register of Grant Support, A Directory of Funding Sources by R.</td>
