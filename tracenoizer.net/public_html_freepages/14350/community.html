 Effusion by Jimmy Tran This piece is dedicated to all the people in my life that have helped me and that I have helped in my lifetime. Hope you think it's dope and if you don't, shove it. Regret by Jimmy Tran This piece is about the alienation I feel in my own community because of my Vietnamese language deficiency. ..</td>

 It has given me an opportunity to work with the Asian people again and be able to practice speaking the language from time to time. In working for SHINE I have been lucky to see two or three happy faces. It has been an honor and so fun to serve the Chinese speaking community here. It has always been a dream of mine to serve the Chinese community and use my bilingual skills in a work environment. It's been really nice because I have had the opportunity to get to know the elders and learn about their backgrounds.</td>
