 Recently, Largo was lost to the shadowlands when he was forged into a shield which the Warden now carries with him. He served the country and flag on several occasions, among them the Korean War. The Korean War was his hardest experience, as it pained him much to leave his family behind and travel over seas to fight the communists, but he believed in his country and the obligation to fight and defeat the north Koreans and their communist allies. During his time in the military he was trained to aid, serve and protect the innocent civilians. During the war Philip was involved in several hard fought struggles and incidents that marked him forever.</td>
