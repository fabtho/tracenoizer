 These materials have important industrial applications, but many of the questions we are addressing deal with fundamental aspects of structure, composition and reactivity. Studies of catalytic kinetics, reaction pathways, and mechanisms are an important part of our work. Production of chemical intermediates and value-added products by clean catalytic processing provides an important environmental motivation for our research. The goal of this research is to prepare interfacial materials with controlled architectures and composition which have specific properties and applications. Several strong collaborations with industry have been involved in both our catalysis and materials research.</td>

 These will include such emerging technologies as a marine algae bandage, an omni-directional periscope camera, new anti-fouling ship hull coating and REMUS, the Navy's newest robotic undersea scout capable of searching for mines and other obstacles. . The ONR Afloat Lab is a shipboard demonstration laboratory showing navy-sponsored research, invention and technology. During Fleet Week the Afloat Lab will open to visitors and feature over two dozen displays, exhibits, and demonstrations. Williams The Office of Naval Research's Afloat Lab (YP679) ties up across from the Intrepid Musuem in New York City for Fleet Week.</td>

 . As a result, the world is full of easy-to-use, small-scale configuration management tools and large-scale, hard-to-use ones. The Vesta project at the Systems Research Center is a research effort to address this problem. This talk begins with a description of "the software configuration management problem", then focuses on the key technical difficulties that must be overcome in order to manage the development of a software system of practically any size (that is, tens of millions of source-code lines). It then presents the Vesta approach and reports our experience with a highly functional prototype system.</td>
