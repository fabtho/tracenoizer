 Production of chemical intermediates and value-added products by clean catalytic processing provides an important environmental motivation for our research. The goal of this research is to prepare interfacial materials with controlled architectures and composition which have specific properties and applications. Several strong collaborations with industry have been involved in both our catalysis and materials research. ..</td>

 In part the answer lies within the family and its condition when the challenge occurs. One classification of conditions affecting family functioning is shown in Figure 1. So the first defense against challenging life events is to be strong and stable, able to fully function. Those with family businesses, either related to agricultural enterprises or not, must also assess the state of their businesses. A similar categorization is shown in Figure 2 to summarize some of the key characteristics of financial performance of farm businesses.</td>

 With a little increase in cost, farmers are not any better off on corn, although deficiency payments are higher. "Indiana wheat production is up about 10 percent, so wheat will be a small plus to Indiana farm income in the coming year," Schrader said. wheat production and price are similar to a year ago, and world production is down about 4 percent, resulting in strong export demand for U. " From mid-1993 to mid-1994, land values increased about 10 percent, based on higher crop prices and lower interest rates. "In the year ahead we expect the opposite situation," Schrader said, "lower crop prices and higher interest rates.</td>
