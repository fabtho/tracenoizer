 These materials have important industrial applications, but many of the questions we are addressing deal with fundamental aspects of structure, composition and reactivity. Studies of catalytic kinetics, reaction pathways, and mechanisms are an important part of our work. Production of chemical intermediates and value-added products by clean catalytic processing provides an important environmental motivation for our research. The goal of this research is to prepare interfacial materials with controlled architectures and composition which have specific properties and applications. Several strong collaborations with industry have been involved in both our catalysis and materials research.</td>

IMF criticism Korean shipyards like Hyundai and Daewoo are now the busiest in the world with order books full for the next two years The BBC's Andrew Wood reports on Korea's booming shipbuilding industryAccording to Lloyds of London, Korea has now replaced Japan as the world leader in shipbuilding. Together the two countires account for nearly three quarters of world production. Korean shipyards are cheap thanks to the devaluation of the Korean won after the Asian economic crisis. But a trade row is brewing with the European Union.</td>
