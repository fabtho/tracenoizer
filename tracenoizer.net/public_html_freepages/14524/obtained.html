 Management models show the need to create protected areas within which ecological balance can be restored. But this will require a further research effort, in particular to understand the most effective sites and size. Among other things, this can lead to the creation of 'eco-labels' for fishery products obtained by respecting these biodiversity criteria. 'Huge progress has already been made,' concludes Dr Nauen. 'Ten years ago we started an international collaboration towards a database on all fishes.</td>

 In addition, we have detected DNase during leaf senescence, providing important information on the mechanism of leaf senescence. Materials and Methods Plant materials Leaves at different developmental stages, from young (full expansion), green1 (May to Aug. ), yellow and dry leaves were obtained from strong and healthy Eucommia ulmoides Oliv. trees which were grown on the campus of Peking University, Beijing, China. DNA extraction and analysis Genomic DNA was isolated from leaf tissues using a CTAB method.</td>

 In the throes of passion or frustration, male otters grab females by their noses, sometimes biting off chunks (and occasionally drowning their chosen sex object in the process). Pups snatch meals from their mothers, and males mug any female in their territory for a snack. In fact, Riedman and Estes estimated that male otters obtained about a third of their caloric intake by theft. One typical behavior, they found, was for a male otter to locate a pup, then float nearby waiting for its mother to surface and confiscate whatever food she brought the moment she came up. Sometimes males even grabbed the pups and held them hostage until the mothers handed over their food.</td>
