 This event I believe is inevitable and to France's credit for being the first country to do such a thing. In my experience, France has consistently been the world leader in this whole debate over the past year or so. I find the US (in second place) slower on the uptake than France on the POLITICAL aspects of the artilect debate. France on the other hand just loves to muddy its hands in such social ideological controversy, so Im finding my reception in France far better. If Im right about this century being dominated by the artilect issue, then it is only a question of time before the politicians have to get involved, so something like this senate hearing has to happen.</td>
