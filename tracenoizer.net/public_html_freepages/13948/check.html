 Remember those weekends in Netley with Sally, Helen, Steve and Darrell. Would be great to hear from anyone that remembers me. me, I've signed in before and check who else has written stuff regularly, I live in Guildford now and work in Camberley for Nortel. no kids or pets, just a girlfriend, beer and music. t teacher that knocked six bells of crap out of me whilst I was in the Third year (what a big man ) I don,t bear any grudges but any witnesses to the incident contact me and for the teacher concerned I didn,t stay a third year for ever and went on to serve a few years in the parachute regiment so this ex paratrooper would like to meet up,its a small world as they say.</td>
