 Hidden somewhere within the sewer maze lies the ominous sounding Black Crystal. It looks just like a normal energy crystal, except you can't see it. You can only see it if you are standing on top of it. Unfortunately it's in a random place every time you start the game, so I can't tell you where it is. Turn off all the thrusters, turn on the electricity, and carry the White Robot through the sewer maze.</td>

 Eventually, WFIU invited listeners to participate by calling in with their answers and afforded correct callers an opportunity to have their name read over the air. And while it does not fit neatly into those multiples-of-five benchmarks, as we recognize important dates in WFIU's history, we can't let the month of May pass without acknowledging WFIU's first program committed specifically to Jazz music. Back to Top Reminiscences of WFIU by Lois Reitzes For Marcel Proust, it was the taste of one Madeleine cookie that unleashed a sufficient number of youthful impressions to fill seven volumes. It was the most valuable training I ever could have wanted for a career in broadcasting. Those years provided not only educational and practical preparation for on-air work; they also contained some sweet as well as hilarious moments.</td>

 It all seems so long ago, mind you history back then was probably easier as there was less of it. I'll keep an eye on the site and see who pops up that I remember. Mark Haughey - do you remember when he left his bollock on top of the fence. Anyone who wants to contact me please use the above email address and they will be passed on to me. now living in wales with two kids, slowly going grey.</td>
