Wherever possible, employment numbers should be reported in terms of full-time equivalent jobs and should indicate the time scale of the project. Where job losses are likely as a result of the proposal, consideration should be given in the EIS to any planned mitigating measures, such as re-skilling, vocational advice or relocation assistance. For major projects or policy changes, it may be necessary to conduct more in-depth modelling to determine the economy-wide impact of the project, including the net impact on employment. This component should be identified where possible and subtracted from the total project expenditure for the purposes of calculating the employment impact.</td>
