 The Kehillah wants to adopt a renewed interpretation of a prayer community for the millenium generation. The prayer style will be traditional yet contemporary, informative and interactive, musical and moving. Please use this form to volunteer to participate in the Capital Kehillah's High Holy Days services. Each person, according to this view, has an inner life that he or she may choose to devleop; this 'inwardness' goes deeper than the usual object of psychological terms. God is experientially accessible through the cultivation of this inner life.</td>
