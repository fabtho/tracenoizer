 It is a religious gathering to reflect upon our mistakes and look forward to a better life in the new year. Reflection, hope and resolution are among the basic elements of an active religious life. This formalized type of thought can be experienced at the New Year's Day Service with participation by every Buddhist including children. Ho-Onko (Thanksgiving to Shinran Shonin) This service takes place on January 16, the day that Shinran Shonin died. His followers gather to express their appreciation and thanksgiving for his efforts in making it possible for us to receive the Love and Mercy of Amida Buddha.</td>
