 Joe is Glaswegian hard man with a quick-draw temper but a basically sweet disposition, has got sober after years of alcoholism, pulling himself back from the brink because he has realised how violent he can be when he drinks. Joe is on the verge of middle age, edgy and anxious to make up for time wasted in the bottle. Slowly revealed in confidences and asides, the devastated emotional landscape that Joe's tough, bright exterior shields comes hurtling out of the past in a startling flashback. By then a new opportunity has come into his life in the shape of Sarah (Louise Goodall), a social worker who has also spent much time working with Liam and his wife. But the resolve of the human spirit and its ability to face up to circumstances that are depressing emotionally wrenching and even violent.</td>
