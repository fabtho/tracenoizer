 I hope this little page of mine is of any help to you. If you find it useful, the best reward you can offer me is to spread the word around. The people at StudyWeb thought this page was good enough to be listed on their Celtic history section. The StudyWeb pages are really excellent, check it out. .</td>

 McKay doesn't bowl over listeners with breathtaking metaphor or puzzling obliqueness--his songwriting style is fairly straightforward. However, he possesses a knack for keenly and sincerely bringing to life people, places and times from throughout his life. In this release, we get to know some of the history and characters from a part of New Jersey heretofore unknown to most non-Garden Staters, the farming area around Secaucus. For I have joined the elders now and I must take my stand in the furnace of humility I will trust His mighty hand. Ownership, copyright and title of this folk music CD review belongs to me, Kevin McCarthy.</td>
