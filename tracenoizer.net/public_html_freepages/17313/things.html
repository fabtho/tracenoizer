<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" "The problem with the program that we have slowly come to realize is that the dealers are plea bargaining out of those stiffer penalties," said Marilyn Evans, CUFA director. Bringing national attention to this issue would help the group's fight with prosecutors and judges to restrict plea bargaining when dealing with crimes occurring in drug-free zones, she said. "One of the things we found out was that Drug Czar Barry McCaffery was planning to spend a lot of money on a new national anti-drug campaign," Evans said. "We feel that we have done a lot of fighting and wanted them to see what we have accomplished. " The main goal for the group was to build a national resource for its programs and possibly get funding from the new drug campaign.">

 I'm going to use the acronym CONTACT to describe some guidelines on how you can build effective rapport with others and present yourself professionally. It is critical to project self-confidence through your handshake, eye contact, and your willingness to risk extending yourself first. One of the most powerful things you can do to make a confident and powerful first impression is to initiate in a handshake. The handshake is a common societal expectation for men and is never questioned. In fact, social etiquette experts still advocate that men should wait for a woman to extend herself first for a handshake.</td>
