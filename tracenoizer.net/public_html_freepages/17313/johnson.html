 Under this program, residents are given cards on which they record where they see drugs being sold in the neighborhood. These cards are then given to the Cincinnati Police Division, which investigates. This program is believed to be the most effective for reducing crime rates in small neighborhoods, said Annabelle Johnson, a member of CUFA for 17 years. The program allows residents from neighborhoods such as Elmwood and East Walnut Hills to anonymously report crimes that they see taking place. "This has allowed people who are afraid to get involved to keep themselves safe while they keep their neighborhood safe," Johnson said.</td>
