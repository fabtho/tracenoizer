 Students as enthusiastic and hard-working as Adrian and Phil could be regarded as a good example of what an ideal V. U member should be, because they are always willing to help. The rest of our members are working hard too, as practically every new member is already involved in voluntary work such as helping teachers in junior schools or working in charity shops, which is the most popular option so far. With Christmas approaching, our next important target will be this year's Rotary Floats, another opportunity for members to help others and have fun at the same time, whatever the weather. will continue to be successful, something that is only possible thanks to the effort and enthusiasm of all of our members.</td>

 This program is believed to be the most effective for reducing crime rates in small neighborhoods, said Annabelle Johnson, a member of CUFA for 17 years. The program allows residents from neighborhoods such as Elmwood and East Walnut Hills to anonymously report crimes that they see taking place. "This has allowed people who are afraid to get involved to keep themselves safe while they keep their neighborhood safe," Johnson said. Anonymously reporting crimes has led to the arrest of some "big fish" drug dealers that threaten the livelihood of neighborhoods, she said. Members of CUFA meet quarterly with the Cincinnati Police Division to receive updates on how programs are working, she said.</td>
