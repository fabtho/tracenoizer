 . Hardware-software tradeoffs play a central role in much of the work. The topics range from design of fast, efficient compilers to fault-tolerant computer systems. Microprocessor-based laboratory instrumentation and parallel processing are also research strengths. The computer engineering group interacts with the digital signal processing, VLSI, and remote sensing groups.</td>

 Copyright 1994 University of Michigan Learning Resource Center. . Chest radiographs remain widely used, but the applications of computer technology in Radiology over the last two decades have led to new imaging techniques capable of demonstrating both fine detail of normal structures and subtle disease processes previously undetectable without invasive procedures such as surgery. The use of imaging techniques for the diagnosis of disease continues to increase rapidly, and familiarization with these investigations is valuable in virtually all areas of medical practice. Thoracic Radiology introduces first and second year medical students to various imaging modalities which may be used to identify and assess the anatomical structures within the thorax and to introduce the concept of living Anatomy by the use of real-time dynamic images.</td>

 These labs include specialized equipment, graduate student offices, and work space for undergraduate researchers. One primary benefit of that research laboratories is that they facilitate group effort by faculty, graduate students, and undergraduates, and the close proximity of the group members enhances the mentoring relationship between senior and junior researchers. CIS and ECE (Electrical and Computer Engineering) have developed a close working relationship that has been beneficial to both departments. This includes maintaining a joint Research Computing Laboratory that provides technical support and oversees research equipment. Two years ago, CIS and ECE jointly received a major NSF CISE infrastructure grant that is providing a high performance cluster of 20 Sun Ultra 450s connected with a Myricom Myrinet switch, multimedia equipment, and additional lab support staff.</td>
