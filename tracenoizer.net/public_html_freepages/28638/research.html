 . These labs include specialized equipment, graduate student offices, and work space for undergraduate researchers. One primary benefit of that research laboratories is that they facilitate group effort by faculty, graduate students, and undergraduates, and the close proximity of the group members enhances the mentoring relationship between senior and junior researchers. CIS and ECE (Electrical and Computer Engineering) have developed a close working relationship that has been beneficial to both departments. This includes maintaining a joint Research Computing Laboratory that provides technical support and oversees research equipment.</td>

 Hardware-software tradeoffs play a central role in much of the work. The topics range from design of fast, efficient compilers to fault-tolerant computer systems. Microprocessor-based laboratory instrumentation and parallel processing are also research strengths. The computer engineering group interacts with the digital signal processing, VLSI, and remote sensing groups. Several faculty members are active in the design of a digital optical computer within the Optoelectronic Computing Systems Center.</td>
