 . The MARKETING LOT is a new start-up company I have set up to offer businesses the opportunity to outsource marketing requirements in situations where there is not adequate time available internally. My services are particularly helpful to companies which are either growing rapidly or which wish to enhance their business activities at a crucial stage in their development. The services are distinctive in that they can also ease demand on resources by completing unfinished work. My ability to pick up and complete work at any stage of its progress is useful at times when internal resources have become stretched for unforeseeable reasons.</td>

 UNDP programmes remain relevant in contributing to Botswana's efforts to address the challenges of poverty, affecting as much as 47 per cent of the population; an AIDS emergency with an estimated 17 per cent HIV infection rate among the adult population, and decreased life expectancy from 67 to 47 years; an unemployment rate estimated at 21 per cent of the 1. 5 million people; and a decline of economic growth rate from 13 per cent to 6. Lack of human resources and underutilization of existing capacity in the country, rather than funding, constitute major development challenges. Notwithstanding Botswana's status as a middle income country and the impressive socio-economic gains to date, there remains a continued need for UNDP and other official development assistance (ODA) support to the country. An effective interministerial coordination mechanism for poverty alleviation should be set up.</td>

 There should be an emphasis on cooperation rather than compulsion. The strategy secretariat or similar body has an important role to play, particularly through demonstration and pilot programmes bridging a number of sectors. Responsibility for implementation becomes more diffuse with each turn of the strategy cycle, and as the institutional mechanisms for sustainable development mature. These will include new forms of partnership that emphasize flexibility, informality and open approaches to problem solving and consensus building. Implementation feeds into, and is guided by, regular review and revision of the policy framework and action plan, based on monitoring and evaluation.</td>
