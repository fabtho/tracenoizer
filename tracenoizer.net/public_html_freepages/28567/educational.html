 Biological Resources Research Center The Biological Resources Research Center (BRRC) was established in 1992 to conduct scientific research and planning efforts necessary to preserve the distinct biotic diversity of Nevada while simultaneously providing for economic viability and other needs of its citizens. The BRRC is a member of the Nevada Biodiversity Research and Conservation Initiative, a collaborative effort among local, state, and federal agencies to incorporate biotic diversity conservation in public land management. The BRRC is part of the Department of Biology at the University of Nevada, Reno and supports educational programs for students, professionals and the community. The NBI was developed to help partner agencies develop land management practices that allow for the conservation of biodiversity, maintenance of ecological integrity and continued economic viability. Effort Gap is an interactive Web application that allows researchers to share their focus of research and discover what other researchers are investigating regarding Conservation biology in Nevada.</td>
