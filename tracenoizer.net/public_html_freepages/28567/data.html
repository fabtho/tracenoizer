 Now when a model is defined, XSPEC will give two sets of model parameters, one for the first datagroup and one for the second. . However, it is often useful to be able to fit simultaneously several data sets with a model whose parameters can be different for each data set. A simple example would be a number of data sets that we expect to have the same model spectrum shape but different normalizations. XSPEC caters to this need through the use of data groups.</td>

 Use this button to copy an existing data group, then add or delete application-ORACLE username pairs to create a new data group. . A data group is a list of Oracle Applications and the ORACLE usernames assigned to each application. If a custom application is developed with Oracle Application Object Library, it may be assigned an ORACLE username, registered with Oracle Applications, and included in a data group. An ORACLE username allows access to an application's tables in an ORACLE database.</td>
