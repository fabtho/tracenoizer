 Return to TDRSS Telecommunication Services Homepage . . Data Groups and Formats General TDRSS utilizes two data groups and several operating modes within the data groups. Data Group 1 (DG-1) is PN Spread, while Data Group 2 is Non Spread. Data Group 1 (DG-1) PN Spread Data Group 1 transmission is beneficial in reducing interference to other customers or terrestrial communication systems, and allows for meeting flux density constraints for lower data rate services.</td>
