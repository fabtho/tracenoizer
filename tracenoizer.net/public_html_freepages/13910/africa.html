 The exhibition includes 65 images from 24 leading South African photographers. It begins with Sam Nzima's famous 1976 photograph of the corpse of Hector Petersen carried in the arms of a friend, after being shot by police. It tracks the most repressive phase of the Apartheid regime in the mid-1980s, when resistance gained momentum although South Africa was placed under virtual martial law, and many of the images on exhibition were outlawed. The photographic journey ends with the final paroxysms of violence when political parties jostled for power in the period between the release of Mandela in 1990 and the historic elections in 1994, which finally introduced democracy. Prints are available for sale individually or as a complete archive.</td>
