 . Marinovich won a Pulitzer Prize for his photograph of a man beaten, burned and mutilated by a mob in the township violence that took place a decade ago, but larger issues haunted him. The images fueled anti-black propaganda while the brutal deaths brought him acclaim, writes Lynne Duke in a Washington Post story. So it's like, wow, sometimes you can have an effect.

 This is as important a document of the Balkan War, or of war in general, as has ever been put to print. The price of the book should not be considered too daunting - the price of war, however, should be. Haviv takes us through a wild and vivid journey in the pages of his Balkan War Journal, revealing the kind of passion and emotion in his images that make it impossible not to see the photographer within the photograph. The essays which accompany the pictures work as an introspective supplement for making the Balkan war more poignant to the reader. These essays, along with the text chronology of the war, are key in differentiating this collection of photographs from an ordinary photobook and helping the reader understand the order of events.</td>
