 . It includes a short description of a variety of 'educational episodes' that took place in that period.

 Creighton University was founded in 1878 with a bequest in the will of Mary Lucretia Creighton. Her gift honored her husband Edward's vision of founding a college to educate the children of the frontier settlers. Just as Creighton University was founded with a gift, it is sustained with gifts from generous donors who believe in the importance of a value-centered, Jesuit education. Creighton University relies on many different types of gifts to fulfill its educational mission. From visible projects such as the Lied Education Center for the Arts and the Beirne Research Tower, to the many endowments for student scholarships and faculty positions, private support helps make a Creighton education exceptional.</td>
