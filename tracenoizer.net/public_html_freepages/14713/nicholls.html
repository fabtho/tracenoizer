 . 4, 2001 BACK TO RESEARCH THIS ISSUE'S HOMEPAGE GAZETTE HOMEPAGE E-MAIL THE EDITOR . 11 What lies beneath by Diana Rucker SPARK writer Jim Nicholls is working hard to predict possible volcanic eruptions in Western Canada. By analyzing the composition of volcanic rocks Nicholls can work out the path the magmas follow to get to the surface. A key feature of this process is that the magma left behind in the chamber will have a slightly different chemical composition with each eruption.</td>
