 If not, more please, and how about a Stalybridge photo tour, preferably complete with a picture of West Hill High School which I went to. Visits to your pages are a constant delight though, as a former pupil of St. what we were really doing was rolling marbles from on end of the prayer-book shelf to t'other end. I cannot recall one single sermon, but I well remember the consternation caused when searching for dropped marbles. A first quick look at the Werneth photo' amazed me as it downloaded.</td>

 Within a level, Donald must track down three Energy Spheres, then find the Gyro-Gamma-Tubal-Teleport, which will warp him to the next level. Magic Books give a timed twist to standard collect-and-go fare. When Donald opens a Magic Book, he simultaneously charges the nearest Energy Sphere and starts a timer. Donald must then find the Energy Sphere before its energy runs out. The action begins on the lush slopes of Duckie Mountain before entering the mean streets of Duckburg.</td>
