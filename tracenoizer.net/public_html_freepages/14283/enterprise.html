 Entrepreneurial activity is shaped by a distinct set of factors, one of the most important being entrepreneurial training. Creating new enterprises in Europe calls for innovative, well trained and enterprising young people. The Junior Enterprise network is a fertile ground for creating such entrepreneurial skills, incorporating students from different universities across Europe in real life projects. As a result of this work students stimulate both their own personal development and the growth of the small and medium-sized enterprises to which they give their services. I wish JADE and all the Junior Enterprises they represent success with all of their activities, and I would like to encourage the students inside this network to create innovative, European-minded strategies in the businesses with which they will work.</td>
