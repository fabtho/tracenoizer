 Liikanen refers to its main findings and mentions first of all an area that affects him closely, namely innovations and the development of new products. For the responsibilities of the commissioner for Enterprise and Information Society in fact include innovation and information technology in addition to more traditional industrial sectors. Good examples of joint research and development have been the ultra-light material projects of the automotive industry, for example, innovative and durable construction materials, and steel containers. Another positive feature is that these projects have involved not only the steel industry but also customers, research and designers. The players in the European steel industry have the potential, and international mergers have shown that they can give major benefits.</td>

 By KevBrown, Industry editor, and Deborah Hargreaves in Brussels, 22 January 2001. . EC Prepares to Dismantle Business Regulation and Expand Corporate Control One of industry's ultimate dreams is about to come true in the European Union. After years of corporate campaigning, the European Commission (EC) is working full speed to replace EU regulations impacting business with self- regulation by business groups. In the few areas where regulations are still to be considered, these will be subject to tough business impact assessments.</td>
