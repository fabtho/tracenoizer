 The challenge is for all the rest of us, in both the public and private sectors. You also combine in an exemplary way local, European and global concerns. The information society and the new knowledge-driven economy have the potential of significantly improving environmental learning and sustainability. I welcome your participation to turn this potential into reality. Feel free to contribute also to the creation of the eEurope Action Plan which is being prepared for the June European Council meeting in Feira.</td>

 Chambers of Commerce of Ireland place your ad here. Throughout the European Union we still need to bring down Internet access costs further by fully liberalising telecoms - especially in the local networks. We also need strong action by Member States to invest heavily in IT-skills in order to secure an information society for all. Businesses, and in particular SMEs, need to be encouraged to embrace online interaction. Governments across the EU should look to the positives and negatives of USA telecommunication deregulations, and take active steps, in such areas as taxation and deregulation to encourage the SMEs to go online.</td>
