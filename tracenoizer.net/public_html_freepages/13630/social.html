 Locality is a particularly important attribute because only people who are immersed in a particular information ecology can provide a local habitation and fit for new technologies. . Introduction This week we want to continue last weeks' social informatics theme by extending our undestanding of information and communication technologies beyond the technology itself. To do this we will think about ICTs through different metaphors provided by Nardi. The general purpose of metaphor is to state relationships between things or categories of objects by using our ideas about these items.</td>

 This view involved a course of linear (or dialectic) Progress into the future. Technology has never been 'neutral' with respect to the logic and the dynamics of the market economy. It is obvious that this approach ignores the social institutioning of science and technology and the fact that the design and particularly the implementation of new techniques is directly related to the social organisation in general and the organisation of production in particular. rational control over nature, society and the self was achieved by redefining reality through the new machine metaphor. In other words, the flourishing of the mechanistic view of Nature was simply an integral part of the new social paradigm that became dominant in the last two centuries and, in particular, of the growth ideology which idealised the dynamics of the market economy.</td>
