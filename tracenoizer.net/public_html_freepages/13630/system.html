 But it is the flimsiest make-believe to pretend that vocational guidance is in the service of human beings. . problematizing vocational education Education in the Ellul's The Technological Society "If we really wished to take into consideration only the individual's aptitudes, we would have to tailor the economic system to them. The obvious impossibility of such a system demonstrates that is is senseless to apply the rule of the primacy of the individual and that vocational guidance cannot be isolated from the other techniques" (Ellul 360). "Vocational guidance then has the task of adapting the individual, through education, to planned manpower requirements" (Ellul 360).</td>

 . The wild life that had existed for millennia started dying, killed by a disease brought by alien versions of progress, arrogant visions of manifest destiny and a runaway utilitarian science. What one concludes is most likely dependent on how well one is faring economically, emotionally and physically in this competitive technological world and the level of privilege one is afforded by the system. These beings are the victims of industrial society. The freedom, for example, to commit murder and get away with it scot-free, with no other burden than the jaunty halo of conscience.</td>

 "Those who assume (usually unconsciously) the impossibility of realizing their life's desires, and of thus fighting for _themselves_, usually end up fighting for an ideal or cause instead (i. Those who know that this is the acceptance of alienation will now know that all ideals and causes are _ideologies_. "Whenever a system of ideas is structured with an abstraction at the centre - assigning a role or duties to you for its sake - this system is an ideology. An ideology is a system of false consciousness in which you no longer function as the subject in your relation to the world. "The various forms of ideology are all structured around different abstractions, yet they all serve the interests of a dominant (or aspiring dominant) class by giving you a sense of purpose in you sacrifice, suffering and submission.</td>
