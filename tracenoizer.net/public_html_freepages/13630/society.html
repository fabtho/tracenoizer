 But it is the flimsiest make-believe to pretend that vocational guidance is in the service of human beings. . problematizing vocational education Education in the Ellul's The Technological Society "If we really wished to take into consideration only the individual's aptitudes, we would have to tailor the economic system to them.

 Only a few are satisfied with their relationships to others. Everybody desires to be in a tight knit group and wants to experience fellowship and a accomplishment together with others. Even in the family - the most intimate unit in society - people, especially young people - lack deep relationships. Analysis of Gang problems have revealed that a Gang is something like a family to the members. A Gang has a very strong moral code and a deep commitment of the members to each other.</td>

 Technology has never been 'neutral' with respect to the logic and the dynamics of the market economy. It is obvious that this approach ignores the social institutioning of science and technology and the fact that the design and particularly the implementation of new techniques is directly related to the social organisation in general and the organisation of production in particular. rational control over nature, society and the self was achieved by redefining reality through the new machine metaphor. In other words, the flourishing of the mechanistic view of Nature was simply an integral part of the new social paradigm that became dominant in the last two centuries and, in particular, of the growth ideology which idealised the dynamics of the market economy. So, it is not technology as such that should be blamed for the present ecological crisis, as deep ecologists usually assert.</td>

 "), was "the dismantling of the present industrial system," as one Earth Firster said (shortly before being arrested for trying to topple an electric-power tower), not just to protect nature but to "throw a monkey wrench" into the industrial machine. Green movement (and co-author with another neo-Luddite, Fritjof Capra, of an early analysis of Green politics), has been an ecofeminist critic of modernism through teaching and writing. In contrast to the original Luddites, who focused on the particular effects of particular machines, the Neo-Luddites are concerned about the way in which dependence upon technology changes the character of an entire society. They are asking us to reflect on the entire configuration of modern technology instead of isolated pieces of it. .</td>
