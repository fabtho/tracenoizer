 The obvious impossibility of such a system demonstrates that is is senseless to apply the rule of the primacy of the individual and that vocational guidance cannot be isolated from the other techniques" (Ellul 360). "Vocational guidance then has the task of adapting the individual, through education, to planned manpower requirements" (Ellul 360). But it is the flimsiest make-believe to pretend that vocational guidance is in the service of human beings. ..</td>

 It was also clear to the critics and victims of colonialist expansionism. Western technological civilisation has, by virtue of its very success and dynamism created a world that teeters unsteadily on the edge of a terrible abyss. But the awareness of how the human project is under threat from its own 'success' can be truly overpowering, unbearable. Hence the recourse by whole populations to all the strategies of avoidance, denial etc provided by ever-growing industries of distraction. Critique, protest, perception of dysfunction are all starting points for recovery.</td>

 . By chance, in the course of history some men have had to perform crushing labors or expose themselves to mortal peril. Never before has the human race as a whole had to exert such efforts in its daily labors as it does today as a result of its absorption into the monstrous technical mechanism--an undifferentiated but complex mechanism which makes it impossible to turn a wheel without the sustained, persevering, and intensive labor of millions of workers, whether in white collar or in blue. The tempo of man's work is not the traditional, ancestral tempo; nor is its aim the handiwork which man produced with pride, the handiwork in which he contemplated and recognized himself. The important thing, however, is not that work is in a sense harsher than formerly, but that it calls for different qualities in man.</td>
