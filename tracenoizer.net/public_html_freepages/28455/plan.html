 FOCUS started 17 years ago when a small group of overseas and Australian students gathered together to study the Bible. We meet on Fridays and Sundays to study God's Word in large meetings and smaller groups, to have fellowship together as a church, and to build each other up in the hope we all share. We will be looking at the idea of Jesus' Resurrection from the dead, where does it fit into God's plan, and how does that impact us. This year will be on Monday 22 July to Friday 26 July at Merroo Conference Centre. Make sure that you have booked this event on your diary, for if you think the FOCUS Church Camp was great, MYC is even better.</td>
