 Next year my students in another course will learn about the chemical properties of DNA in a literature-based problem I call "Jurassic Park Revisited. . Yet when faculty consider introducing problem-based learning into their courses, one of the perceived "problems" is a lack of suitable problems. Adoption of the problem-based approach to learning can profoundly change one's notion of a good problem. End-of-the-chapter textbook problems suddenly seem inappropriate -- often contrived, narrowly focused, and vaguely irrelevant.</td>

NWK Problem Data Sets NWK Problem Data Sets These files contain the SAS statements and the data needed to create the SAS data sets for problems in Neter, Wasserman, and Kutner. The course notes, however, may refer to these files by their old names. This means that you can access these data sets directly, simply by referring to the data by the two-part name.</td>
