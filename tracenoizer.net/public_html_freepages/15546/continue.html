 These donations provide scholarships for students, support for faculty and programs, funding for current operations, and financial assistance for ongoing initiatives such as the Campaign for the Virginia Tech Alumni and Conference Center and the Campaign for the South End Zone of Lane Stadium. Private giving has contributed immeasurably to making Virginia Tech a world-class institution -- an institution that consistently ranks among the nation's top 50 research universities and is currently 24th among public universities in the latest U. As it prepares for the challenges and opportunities of a new century, Virginia Tech will continue to look to the generosity of donors to help support its land-grant mission of teaching, research, and public service. The Office of University Development is the fundraising arm of Virginia Tech. Gifts can be designated to a specific college or area or they can be unrestricted, which provides the university with the resources to meet its priority needs.</td>

 The most common grub species in our area is the annual white grub, of which the adult is a tan chafer beetle. Eggs are laid in the soil in mid-summer, primarily on well-watered lawns in full sun, often near pavement. Damage from annual white grubs typically starts in mid August and may continue until early October. Other species may damage lawns in northern Illinois, but usually are not as common as annual white grub. Monitoring and control of these species is the same as for annual white grub.</td>
