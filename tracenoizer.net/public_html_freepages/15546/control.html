 This White Paper assesses both standard and promising new therapies. In this White Paper, we compare and evaluate these established modes of therapy, as well as new alternative modalities of treatment. In this White Paper, we review the latest improvements in disease management, including how to take greater control of your own care. This White Paper discusses modern screening techniques and treatments for cataracts, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy.

 Damage from annual white grubs typically starts in mid August and may continue until early October. Other species may damage lawns in northern Illinois, but usually are not as common as annual white grub. Monitoring and control of these species is the same as for annual white grub. The true white grub (May or June beetle), for example, typically has a three-year life cycle, meaning it could potentially damage lawns throughout the season. Japanese beetle grubs can also occur in northern Illinois, with timing very similar to annual white grub.</td>

 Sometimes, an electrophysiology (EP) study is necessary to determine the presence of the extra pathway. Treatment Treatment of WPW is based on the severity of symptoms experienced with the rapid heart rates. Medications may be able to control the occurrence of any rapid heart rates. However, some people are not able to tolerate these medications. In addition, very fast heart rates and severe symptoms (such as loss of consciousness) may persist despite the use of medications.</td>
