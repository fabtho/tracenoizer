 . We are using functional genomics approaches to study development and evolution. The first focuses on the problem of building genome-wide regulatory networks. People working on this problem are using the transcriptional response to the hormone ecdysone to map the genetic circuitry responsible for life cycle transitions in Drosophila melanogaster. The second set of projects are concerned with the problem of the functional evolution of the genome and its relationship to phenotypic differences among closely related species.</td>

 I personally haven't received any Snow White stuff for a couple of days now, so hopefully the problem has been fixed. . I wanted to let everyone know that we're aware of the problem, and taking steps to prevent it from continuing. It's a variation of that Melissa virus or something (sorry, I haven't even used a windows machine in months, I don't follow the virus thing anymore). Anyway, don't open it, update your virus software, yada yada.</td>
