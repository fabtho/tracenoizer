 . Keanu Reeves is Thomas Anderson, a programmer for a respectable firm. In his spare time, Anderson assumes the role of Neo, a hacker who's guilty of every computer crime for which there exists a law against. The Matrix is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth. The matrix is really a simulation created by artificially intelligent (AI) beings who use humans as their power source.</td>

 Shimomura nimmt die Verfolgung auf und erlebt Interessantes, waehrend Markoff schreiben kann. Soweit man einen reality thriller ueber das Internet lesen will, wird man also gut bedient. Obschon die Hacker- und Internet-Szene (etwa in Hacktick. com) den Fall nur unter Gesichtspunkten der Datensicherung und der Netikette diskutiert, laedt ein zweiter Blick auf das Buch ein zu einer ganz anders gelagerten, naemlich kulturkritischen Betrachtung. Computer security programs are like a locksmith's picks, easily turned into burglary tools.</td>
