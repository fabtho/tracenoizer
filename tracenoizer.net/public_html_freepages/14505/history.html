 The Net As more personal information gets stored on computers, identity theft becomes a growing problem, especially for the main character of this film. When she later hears that the friend has died mysteriously, she realizes the program contains hidden information for which her friend was probably murdered. When the murderer discovers that Bennett possesses the program, he alters her entire identity by creating an elaborate, electronic criminal history in her name. Forced to run from authorities who believe she's a dangerous outlaw, Bennett must determine what the information in the program means and prove her innocence before the authorities find her. Hollywood hackers often don't bear much resemblance to their real-world kin.</td>
