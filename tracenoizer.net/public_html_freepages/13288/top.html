Singing Science Records Singing Science Records When I was a kid my parents got this six-LP set of science-themed folk songs for my sister and me. Zaret's main claim to fame is writing the lyrics to the classic "Unchained Melody" for the 1955 movie "Unchained", later recorded by the Righteous Brothers and more recently used in "Ghost". Three of the albums (the best three in my opinion) were performed by Tom Glazer, semi-famous 1940s folk musician and somewhat of a lyricist himself (he wrote "On Top of Spaghetti"). The Singing Science lyrics were very Atomic Age, while the tunes were generally riffs on popular or genre music of the time. In February 1998 I found the LPs in my parents' basement.</td>
