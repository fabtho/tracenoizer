 Judge Juan Guzman indicted Pinochet on a charge of kidnapping, asking that he be held under house arrest and ordering him to face trial in connection with the "disappearances" of prisoners in the first months of his seventeen-year dictatorship. The verdict, in which an overwhelming majority of the court upheld the lifting of immunity, means that Pinochet should now face trial for human rights violations committed at the start of his seventeen-year dictatorship. High Court ruling that Home Secretary Jack Straw should divulge details of the medical examination of the former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to the four states that are seeking his extradition. It urged British Home Secretary Jack Straw to release to interested parties the medical evaluation of the former Chilean dictator. The crimes for which Pinochet is closest to indictment include his command responsibility for a military task force, popularly known as the "Caravan of Death," which removed scores of prisoners from jail and executed them one month after the 1973 military coup.</td>
