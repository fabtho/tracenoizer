 Here we take you on a tour of web sites from around the world from those who loathe him, and those who worship him. Those who supported him and those who were executed by him. The General is a big 'Maggie' fan - apparently he calls her office to arrange afternoon tea every time he visits London. The Government may monitor and audit the usage of this system, and all persons are hereby notified that use of this system constitutes consent to such monitoring and auditing. Augusto Pinochet, Chile's former dictator, assumed a much-disputed Senate seat Wednesday.</td>

 Has it ever been a head of state, taken, arrested in this way. The amnesty law exempted a few people from prosecution and in fact today in Chile the head of the secret police, the former secret police, General Contreras, is in prison for human rights abuses. But most cases have been thrown out by the courts precisely because of the amnesty law that Pinochet had established before he left office. Wedgewood, give us some idea of how this evolved in international law. When Nuremberg said that there are crimes against humanity that can be tried by international tribunals, the Geneva Conventions that were created in 1949 after the war, established the idea of universal jurisdiction for war crimes in international wars.</td>

 In the plebiscite the advocates of a "No" vote won, and, again according to the provisions of the constitution, open elections were held the next year. Also due to the transitional provisions of the constitution, Pinochet remained the Commander-in-Chief of the Army until March 1998. Upon leaving that post, he took a senatorial position for life, granted by the constitution to all former presidents with at least six years in office. His senatorship made an eventual prosecution in Chile harder. While travelling abroad, Pinochet was arrested in October 1998 in London.</td>
