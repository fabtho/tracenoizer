 These components send and receive events consisting of Scheme expressions to be evaluated, results of evaluation, and waveform data. For more information, see the POD documentation included with the module. PL make test make install The test suite will not run in its entirety unless you have a Festival server running on your system. Please report any build or test failures to the address at the top of this file. .</td>

 I have a simple perl program written that runs as a wrapper around festival in tts mode, accepts multiple clients, and says whatever any of them feed into it. . Does this require that festival be run in server mode. Running festival in sever mode is a huge security hole, you can enter arbitrary scheme code to fiddle with files on the system, for example. It might not be a good idea to package something that requires the user open a gigantic security hole on their system to be useful.</td>

 If it does, switch back to ked by re-issuing the command (voice_ked_diphone) at the end of the file. Switching to a specific voice will overide any defaults, so you shouldn't need to change the defaults. If you were here at CSTR I would say check the version of festival that speechd runs is the same one that you get when you run it interactively, but I assume you only have one version installed. Failing all this, it may be possible that the client end is setting the voice explicitly, but I don't believe speechd does this (anyone care to comment. .</td>
