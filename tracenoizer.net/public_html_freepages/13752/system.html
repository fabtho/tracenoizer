 . Does this require that festival be run in server mode. Running festival in sever mode is a huge security hole, you can enter arbitrary scheme code to fiddle with files on the system, for example. It might not be a good idea to package something that requires the user open a gigantic security hole on their system to be useful. I have a simple perl program written that runs as a wrapper around festival in tts mode, accepts multiple clients, and says whatever any of them feed into it.</td>

 gz currently, because there is alot of broken or unfinished code in the script at the time. If you are interested in joining my effort to create a Emacspeak speech server to SABLE converter . net for a developer account (its absolutly free of charge and a very community based system) and Ill add you to the espeakf project so you can commit changes to the CVS. ..</td>
