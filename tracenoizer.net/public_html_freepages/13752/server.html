 net for a developer account (its absolutly free of charge and a very community based system) and Ill add you to the espeakf project so you can commit changes to the CVS. . The speech server is quite unfinished but already makes working with Emacspeak and Festival possible. gz currently, because there is alot of broken or unfinished code in the script at the time. If you are interested in joining my effort to create a Emacspeak speech server to SABLE converter .</td>

 2 Shell API The simplest use of Festival (though not the most powerful) is simply using it to directly render text files as speech. festival --tts This is easy to use but you will need to wait for Festival to start up and initialise its databases before it starts to render the text as speech. A socket based server mechanism is provided in Festival which will allow a single server process to start up once and be used efficiently by multiple client programs. For many application this will be the preferred interface method. Other text modes too are available through the command line by using auto-text-mode-alist.</td>
