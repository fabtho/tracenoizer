 Most images in this campaign show a female child in the hope of changing traditional Chinese attitudes towards girls (sometimes referred to traditionally as "maggots mixed in with the rice"). . Political Images This site is designed to give you a visual sense of some of the political events we cover in this class. This image is from a Cultural Revolution-era pamphlet denouncing Deng Xiaoping (vilified during the Cultural Revolution as "the number two person in authority taking the 'capitalist road'"). For those of you who read Chinese, notice that the last character comprising Deng's name is displayed upside down -- an expression of profound disrespect.</td>
