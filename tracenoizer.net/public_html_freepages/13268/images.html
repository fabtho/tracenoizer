 An article in Science (November 29, 1996) presents evidence for polar ice deposits from a bistatic radar experiment that used signals from the Clementine spacecraft (right). Bistatic observations from the Arecibo Observatory (left) appear to refute this interpretation, but new results from the Neutron Spectrometer instrument abord the Lunar Prospector indicate that hydrogen atoms are present at both lunar poles. The PDS Imaging Node, in collaboration with the Solar System Visualization Project and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Public Information Office, has constructed a Planetary Photojournal -- images of the planets produced by the U. Inspect the latest additions to the Planetary Data System, and the latest news from the National Space Science Data Center (NSSDC). edu) at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and updated monthly.</td>

 gov The purpose of this Web site is to contribute to the understanding of patterns, characteristics, and dynamics of land cover across the United States and across the world. Staff at the USGS EROS Data Center use satellite data to map national and international land masses, to analyze trends in land cover, and to provide applications assistance. In addition, the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics Consortium has compiled a series of Landsat-7 images over the United States. See MRLC's National Land Cover Web pages to check out land cover in your area. If you would like to use this feature, you will need to turn on your scripting abilities for your browser.</td>
