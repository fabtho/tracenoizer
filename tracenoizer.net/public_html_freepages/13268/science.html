 The SSDS customer community ranges from the NASA and international space science research communities to students, educators and the general public. . The Space Science Data System is the confederation of groups supported by NASA's Office of Space Science to provide public access to and to ensure the usability of science data from OSS missions and selected other data. Some SSDS groups develop tools and services for finding and using these data. Long-term data accessibility is ensured by SSDS archiving and preservation of the data.</td>

 . Planetary Data System Home The Planetary Data System (PDS) archives and distributes scientific data from NASA planetary missions, astronomical observations, and laboratory measurements. The PDS is sponsored by NASA's Office of Space Science. Its purpose is to ensure the long-term usability of NASA data and to stimulate advanced research. Additional information is also available in the PDS Annual Report.</td>

 We archive and distribute digital data related to the study of the surfaces and interiors of planetary bodies using active and passive microwave sensing techniques. A variety of Consultation Services are available to assist your work with our current data holdings, and to assist you in preparing new data sets. An article in Science (November 29, 1996) presents evidence for polar ice deposits from a bistatic radar experiment that used signals from the Clementine spacecraft (right). Bistatic observations from the Arecibo Observatory (left) appear to refute this interpretation, but new results from the Neutron Spectrometer instrument abord the Lunar Prospector indicate that hydrogen atoms are present at both lunar poles. The PDS Imaging Node, in collaboration with the Solar System Visualization Project and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Public Information Office, has constructed a Planetary Photojournal -- images of the planets produced by the U.</td>
