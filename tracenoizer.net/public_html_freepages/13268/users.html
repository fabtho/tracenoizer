 This mechanism should be entirely web-based, and should include a well conceived HTML player to ensure the mechanism can be used on all platforms. This includes the integration of all major propriety and free streaming codecs including Quicktime, Real, Microsoft, and MPEG codecs as well as Ogg Vorbis and Divx. In addition the player will have the built-in Frequency Clock functionality allowing users to select public timetables or 'channels' from the player interface. Lastly the player will integrate with the backend for communicating meta data about the content playing or scheduled to be played. Further backend-player communication is also anticipated (for more information about the player functionality please see the technical functional description).</td>
