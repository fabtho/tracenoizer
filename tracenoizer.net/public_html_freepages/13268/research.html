 Production of event data sets Using the KEDS and TABARI programs, news reports from the Reuters wire service, and the World Events Interaction Survey (WEIS) event coding scheme, we have produced several event data sets -- primarily for the Middle East -- for the period 1979 to the present. Shorter data sets (1989-1999) are available for the Balkans and Central Asia. Development of early warning methods For the past four years, most of our research has focused on the development of early warning techniques for political change, primarily using the Arab-Israeli conflict as a case study. Site Map KEDS Project A general description of the KEDS project and related event data projects. FAQ Frequently Asked Questions about the KEDS project Event data An introduction to the concept of event data and its application to political research, plus a bibliography of published articles using KEDS-generated data KEDS-based Research An introduction to the KEDS event data and research projects via our 1996 American Political Science Association poster session.</td>
