 The jet stream provides the foundation from which most major weather systems develop and grow. . Page Title Next Page Page 20 creased wind speed in the jet stream. Air lifting out ahead of this shortwave can create low pressure beneath the air mass in the lower levels of the atmosphere. Some of the biggest storms come when the northern branch of the jet stream can work together with the southern branch.</td>

 Three zones of westerlies can be seen in each hemisphere on this illustration. Each zone is associated with either the Hadley, Ferrel, or Polar circulation cell. It resembles a stream of water moving west to east and has an altitude of about 10 kilometers. Its air flow is intensified by the strong temperature and pressure gradient that develops when cold air from the poles meets warm air from the tropics. Wind velocity is highest in the core of the polar jet stream where speeds can be as high as 300 kilometers per hour.</td>

 More on winds, including jet streams Go to Weather front page . . Usually, the jet stream separates cold polar air to its north from warmer air to its south. During major cold outbreaks over the USA, the jet stream often dives south, sometimes moving well over the Gulf of Mexico. During unusually mild winter weather and during the summer, the jet stream retreats northward into Canada.</td>
