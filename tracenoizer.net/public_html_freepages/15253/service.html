 We get that with Illuminet--it just works with no hassle--which is what we need. Built upon our expertise in network and data management, we have been an active player in the definition and development of NP services for both wireline and wireless carriers. Illuminet offers an end-to-end service bureau approach to Number Portability that saves capital expense, human resources and administrative effort. We offer Service Order Administration (SOA) to manage the porting process. Our service offers competitive features that help you meet the demands of NP administration.</td>

 (3-20-2002) Back to CNS Home Back to Stanford Computing and Communication . . The same group of people will process your orders and will send you a confirmation via email with your Service Order Number and a date when ITSS will complete the order. ITSS is very interested in your feedback on the usefulness of the online CSO and your suggestions on how we can improve this service, including which other services you'd like to order online. ITSS hopes you find this new ordering option helpful.</td>
