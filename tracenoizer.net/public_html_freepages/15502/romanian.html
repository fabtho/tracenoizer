 .de) Here's an update of my thoughts on citizen politics and ICT. It's available on the WWW in Hungarian, Romanian, French (not yet up on the web) and English. (Maybe the e-mail systems will have problems with some Hungarian letters of the alphabet - but things should be o. ) Some applications of information technology to citizen participation in politics.</td>

 Dracula - The Truth VLAD THE IMPALER - DRACULA For almost a millenium, the lands in the Carpathian-Danubian-Pontic area were ploundered by the migratory people. Beginning with the 10th and 11th centuries, the Eastern part of Europe begins to be threatened by the last large migratory vallum, made of Turkish nations. The Romanian Country had the Black Sea in the East, the Ottoman Empire in the South and Moldavia and Transylvania in the North. Between 1389-1402 the ruler of the Ottoman Empire was Sultane Baiazid (nicknamed The Lightning). The Romanian Country was ruled by Mircea the Old, one of the greatest leaders of the Romanian army, who defeated two large military expeditions commanded by Baiazid.</td>

 . More than 20 thousand tons of sediment - laden with lead, zinc, copper and a small amount of cyanide - entered the Vaser spring, and from there flowed into the river Viso which is a tributary of river Tisza. This spill comes less than six weeks after another Romanian mining operation spilled cyanide into tributaries of the Tisza River. The cyanide from that spill at Baia Mare from the Aural S. mine tailings recovery operation was carried downstream into the Danube, killing millions of fish and other wildlife.</td>
