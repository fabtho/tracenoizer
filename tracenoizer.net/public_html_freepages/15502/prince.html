 If you find this review helpful, be sure to vote at Amazon. . Prince John treats Fulke poorly, deriding him as a country bumpkin because he heralds from the Welsh marshes. His father's lessons in honor have not prepared Fulke for the deceptions and cruelty of court, making him a frequent target of Prince John's ire, culminating in the day the prince breaks a chessboard across Fulke's nose. When the dust settles, the prince looked much worse.</td>

 After all these years Caernarfon's immense strength remains unchanged. Standing at the mouth of the Seiont river, the fortress (with its unique polygonal towers, intimidating battlements and colour banded masonry) dominates the walled town also founded by Edward I. Caernarfon's symbolic status was emphasized when Edward made sure that his son, the first English Prince of Wales, was born here in 1284. In 1969, the castle gained worldwide fame as the setting for the Investiture of Prince Charles as Prince of Wales. History comes alive at Caernarfon in so many ways - along the lofty wall walks, beneath the twin-towered gatehouse and within imaginative exhibitions located within the towers.</td>
