 During the privatisation of the electricity supply industry in England and Wales, Ian led teams designing and implementing processes and systems for a completely new business environment. For the 12 regional electricity companies he worked with client representatives to envisage the new business processes to support the new market in electricity, the computer systems needed, and the companies' staff roles and responsibilities. Working with the client representatives and with a large team of system developers, Ian went on to lead the development and implementation of the new systems and processes, including training not just in the use of the system but also in the new supporting business processes. The Non Fossil Purchasing Agency was a completely new body set up by the 12 regional electricity companies to manage their procurement of non-fossil energy, mainly from the nuclear generators. .</td>

 I have had my power turned off several times and some days I don't have anything in my refrigerator and am forced to ask people in the community to help feed me. Please don't be fooled by all of the public attention that Todd and Peter's case have gotten in California. The people who are supporting Todd and Peter financially, are not supporting me. I have worked hard to get my name out there and have my story heard and will continue to do so. I am doing this in order to win my case and help save my life and the lives of thousands of others and I will continue to do so until I win and set this important precedent.</td>

 It is possible to represent the truth values of each of these statements with what is called a 'truth table'. Each kind of statement will have its own truth table which will represent all of the possible combinations of truth and falsity for the simple statements and the resulting truth or falsity of the compound statement of which they are a part. The supporting statements are referred to as PREMISES, and the one supposedly being supported is called the CONCLUSION. In presenting an argument, the peddler is not just stating a list of separate facts, but rather is seeking to JUSTIFY (show the truth of) one statement by offering the other statements as support for it. An argument is a collection of statements, not "a squabble".</td>
