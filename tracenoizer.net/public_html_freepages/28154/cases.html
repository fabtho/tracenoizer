 If you are dealing (struggling) with adapting legacy systems to realities of changing business processes in your organization one or more of the papers are bound to be applicable. There is a wealth of knowledge, lessons learned and strategies buried between the covers of this book. Some of the papers are dryly written, but all contain thought-provoking ideas and, in some cases, solutions. This book is suited more for academics, upper technical management and consultants, and to that audience will prove to be a valuable resource. , each book must be in subject 1 AND subject 2 AND .</td>

 Please keep in mind that this is really important only when the string and evaluations to handle grows dramatically in size and complexity. Plus visually parsing it is a pain, as you have to go back and forth between the string and the format tuple. Again, for complex, long cases it gets fragile quickly. That's such a rare case that I don't mind strange solutions for it. Ping's implementation seems to 'do the right thing' in all cases, produces no surprises and doesn't at all require the kind of grossness you quoted.</td>

 Saying one thing, in here, and then attending meetings and acting as if they still belong are as much a traitor (to everyone involved) as the person who is attempting to goad us with news of an email. It appears that small items like mugs and other prizes for small contests never materialized. In some cases it was the FL who never sent in the request. In other cases it was the person in charge of procuring the items at corp. That was such a small irritation that I just chalked it up as incompetence.</td>
