 I encourage each of you to take advantage of the many educational and opportunities offered by the New York Metropolitan Chapter of ISSA. Attend as many meetings as possible during the course of the year. They are free to members and offer an excellent forum for knowledge transfer and information exchange. Network with your colleagues from other organizations. Many of you are receiving greater recognition from your management.</td>

 To a large extent, this is an organisational memory issue since much of the cost arises from the difficulty of recovering the motivating requirements for the existing processes and supporting systems. Without this information, the impact of proposed changes cannot be properly assessed. It is costly to elicit the information anew and, in any case, the key people who possess the knowledge may be unavailable. However, the information is often implicit in documents such as requirements specifications, operating manuals and data models. These typically provide definitions of functions, operating procedures and information structures but lack information about how the organisational structures and business processes provided their motivation.</td>

Is it their innate ability to divine the future, understand the past, or look absolutely perfect whether dressed for a royal wedding or frolicking on the French Riviera in tiny, thong-style swimwear.</td>
