 Clair, let's apply the personification-of-social-developments approach even-handedly. And the way to grab people's attention is not by waving statistical trends on deforestation or global warming or any of a myriad of other environmental ills. People respond when they can put a human face on problems. Edison's subsidiary Mission Energy is building dirty coal-fired plants in Indonesia. Local indigenous communities charge the company has polluted local rivers, killing fish and forests, and that the Indonesian military has committed brutal human rights abuses to crush anti-Freeport protests.</td>

 In proceedings of the workshop on Comparing Corpora, held in conjunction with the 38th annual meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2000). In proceedings of 5th International Conference on Applications of Natural Language to Information Systems (NLDB'2000). This poses many problems for engineers who must derive problem understanding and synthesise precise solution descriptions from free text. This is true both for the largely unstructured textual descriptions from which system requirements are derived, and for more formal documents, such as standards, which impose requirements on system development processes. This paper describes experiments that we have carried out in the REVERE project to investigate the use of probabilistic natural language processing techniques to provide systems engineering support.</td>
