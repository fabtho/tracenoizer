 ) What's the point of getting rid of your acne if you're obese and end up dying because of heart failure. To me acne is caused by one thing and that is STRESS.

 This Synergy, produced via communication through Our Shared World, greatly amplifies our collective abilities to Interpret and Model Reality and to Act within and upon that Reality. These Synergistic Actions would not be possible by either of Us alone, and are the result of Synergy enabled through the coupling of Our Worlds via Our Shared Signs. TOC Sign, Fact and Thing We classify and partition the Undifferentiated Reality into a Differentiated Reality composed of Things to which we attach Concepts within Our Worlds. The Thing Hood of the Things that We Impose upon Reality are Mental Constructs within Our World, in order that we may partition the Reality modeled by Our World. Our partitioning of the Undifferentiated Reality into Things allows us to Reason and to communicate about Reality, by breaking the Undifferentiated Reality into various constituent parts as the Things that make up this Undifferentiated Reality.</td>

 If read carefully, the hosts are accused of padding their bills, and being unrealistic about what was to come. Isn't it a fact that hosts are still being told everything is fine . when in fact things are far from being ok with this company.
