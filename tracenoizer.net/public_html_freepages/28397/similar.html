 Other analytical groups, based on geographic regions and levels of external debt, are also used. Low-income and middle-income economies are sometimes referred to as developing economies. The use of the term is convenient; it is not intended to imply that all economies in the group are experiencing similar development or that other economies have reached a preferred or final stage of development. Classification by income does not necessarily reflect development status. These operational guidelines were established three decades ago, based on the view that since poorer countries deserve better conditions from the Bank, comparative estimates of economic capacity needed to be established.</td>

 Most programs begin at the kindergarten or first grade level (a few have preschool components) and extend through the elementary span of the school (usually fifth or sixth grade). Articulation beyond elementary school has become a major concern for many districts, and few have so far instituted a full K-12 sequence. Program Design Although most programs share similar goals, design choices vary considerably. In some cases, the choices represent concessions to local conditions, such as demographics or community attitudes (e. , a neighborhood school with relatively few native English speakers may choose to go forward with a two-way program without a balance of language backgrounds represented in each class).</td>
