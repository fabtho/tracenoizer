 Low-income and middle-income economies are sometimes referred to as developing economies. The use of the term is convenient; it is not intended to imply that all economies in the group are experiencing similar development or that other economies have reached a preferred or final stage of development. Classification by income does not necessarily reflect development status. These operational guidelines were established three decades ago, based on the view that since poorer countries deserve better conditions from the Bank, comparative estimates of economic capacity needed to be established. GNI per capita is therefore the Bank's main criterion of classifying countries.</td>

 They vary a good deal, however, in the approaches and strategies they use to work toward those goals. Much of the variability can be seen as an asset, demonstrating flexibility needed to meet local conditions. Some issues, however, reflect concerns that remain to be addressed through accumulated experience and additional research. Not only do they provide a sound basis for academic excellence for all students, they also help us meet the goal of foreign language learning as one of the core subjects. With students learning through two languages in two-way bilingual education, we can profit from the growing diversity in our schools to address the need for better understanding and communication across cultures.</td>
