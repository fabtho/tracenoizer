 "One group is those with direct experience of the criminal justice system, personally or through family and friends. The other is those who only know what they read and hear, all from the point of view that more prisons make us safer. " This isn't Cornyn and Johnson's first venture into social action. Their studio was founded in 1994, when they and former partner Chris Vail signed on as the design team for a site to showcase photographer Gilles Peress's Bosnia photos. Cornyn and Johnson got the idea for 360degrees after reading The Real War on Crime, a report by an independent commission.</td>

 At the New Art Center, we nurture children's creativity, encourage emerging artists; develop teaching and performing oppurtunities; and engage in the community with new and important exhibitions. As one relates to an other, what lies between is the experience. -Alison Cornyn, curator "Between," features an array of eleven artists who are using technology to try and make sense or bring meaning to the experience of time, of intangible spaces and of the fusion of the two. I grew up across the street from the New Art Center; taking after school art classes and attending gallery openings. "Between" is the first exhibit I have seen at the New Art Center that concentrates on media or technology.</td>
