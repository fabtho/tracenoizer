 . The primary hope for interactive media is that it will enable the delivery of dynamic data and allow visitors to explore, at their own pace, historical and entertainment content. This site utilizes multiple forms of media to layer personal stories and views of the criminal justice system and at the same time contrasts them with historical content to create an multi-layered interactive experience. It also opens the door for connections from the audience to the various characters. With equal passion for content, design innovation and technology this site is not only beautifully rendered but impressively balanced.</td>
