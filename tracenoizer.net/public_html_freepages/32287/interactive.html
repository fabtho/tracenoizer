 com G Glass Compendium Interactive Specifier Sun Microsystems, Inc. . The primary hope for interactive media is that it will enable the delivery of dynamic data and allow visitors to explore, at their own pace, historical and entertainment content. This site utilizes multiple forms of media to layer personal stories and views of the criminal justice system and at the same time contrasts them with historical content to create an multi-layered interactive experience. It also opens the door for connections from the audience to the various characters.</td>

 Over the next few years, 360 Degrees will tackle issues such as immigration, welfare reform, class bias and the workplace. Creative Capital funding will help support a year-long pilot project on the American criminal justice system. Every two months a new module will be added to the series and will include first-person stories, interactive data and a forum for discussion. The project utilizes the technology of 360-degree QuickTimeVR panoramas, which place viewers in the center of a room so that the visitor can experience being in a prison cell or judge's chamber while listening to intimate portraits captured through audio diaries. Additionally, interactive data games invite visitors to put themselves in the big picture.</td>
