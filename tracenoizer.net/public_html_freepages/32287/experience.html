 Creative Capital funding will help support a year-long pilot project on the American criminal justice system. Every two months a new module will be added to the series and will include first-person stories, interactive data and a forum for discussion. The project utilizes the technology of 360-degree QuickTimeVR panoramas, which place viewers in the center of a room so that the visitor can experience being in a prison cell or judge's chamber while listening to intimate portraits captured through audio diaries. Additionally, interactive data games invite visitors to put themselves in the big picture. Changing these variables will reveal the influence that race and economics have on statistical outcomes.</td>
