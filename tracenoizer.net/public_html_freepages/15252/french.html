 This Ring of the never fading Rose site is owned by David Simmons. . Beginning just before Marie's arrival at Versailles and her marriage to the heir to the French throne, we follow the lives and loves of these people at the very top of French society, all the while seeing the signs of the upcoming Revolution that will bring it all crashing down. The Rose of Versailles incorporates many real French historical figures and events into its story, all the while maintaining the emphasis on human relations and emotions. Oscar, the story's central character and a creation of Ikeda, is a girl raised by her father as a man, who commands the palace guards at Versailles.</td>
