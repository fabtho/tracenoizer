 HYPERMENTAL discloses "post-surrealistic" aspects which are manifest in the works of many differing art movements in the second half of the 20th century. A power of the imaginary binds the pictures and objects, the videos and installations of this exhibition.

 After graduating from Yale in 1991, Barney entered the art world to almost instant controversy and success. The title of the films refers to the muscle that raises and lowers the male reproductive system according to temperature, external stimulation, or fear. The films themselves are a grand mixture of history, autobiography, and mythology, an intensely private universe in which symbols and images are densely layered and interconnected. The resulting cosmology is both beautiful and complex. Matthew Barney won the prestigious Europa 2000 prize at the 45th Venice Biennale in 1996.</td>
