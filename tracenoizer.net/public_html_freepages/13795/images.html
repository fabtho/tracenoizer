 1999 Olympics, Annie 1997 Broken Dreams, Antonin Krotochvil, Nov. . Our thoughts and prayers are with all the journalists in the war ravaged regions who are risking their lives to bring their images to the public. Our hearts and sympathies go out to the family and friends of Daniel Pearl. 1999 Olympics, Annie 1997 Broken Dreams, Antonin Krotochvil, Nov.</td>

 Despite their haphazard look of the works, there was evident art and affection at play. Eamonn carped that Barney, who was nominated for his Cremaster series of films, was represented in the exhibition by still photographs. Gerry was not so perturbed by this and was very engaged by Barney's images, their outlandishness, imagination and subversion. ..</td>

 After graduating from Yale in 1991, Barney entered the art world to almost instant controversy and success. The title of the films refers to the muscle that raises and lowers the male reproductive system according to temperature, external stimulation, or fear. The films themselves are a grand mixture of history, autobiography, and mythology, an intensely private universe in which symbols and images are densely layered and interconnected. The resulting cosmology is both beautiful and complex. Matthew Barney won the prestigious Europa 2000 prize at the 45th Venice Biennale in 1996.</td>
