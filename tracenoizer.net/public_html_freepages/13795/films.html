 This intermingling of sports and art informs his work as a sculptor and filmmaker. After graduating from Yale in 1991, Barney entered the art world to almost instant controversy and success. The title of the films refers to the muscle that raises and lowers the male reproductive system according to temperature, external stimulation, or fear. The films themselves are a grand mixture of history, autobiography, and mythology, an intensely private universe in which symbols and images are densely layered and interconnected. The resulting cosmology is both beautiful and complex.</td>

 This program is generously supported by Contemporary Extension, an auxiliary of SFMOMA. . Since 1994, Barney has completed three sections of the series-in-progress, beginning with Cremaster 4 (1994) and Cremaster 1 (1995), which will be the fourth and first films in the completed cycle. The Spring Film Program features the latest installment of his epic project, Cremaster 5, which will be the final film in the completed series. Through a montage of imagery and symbolically related events, Barney constructs a sinuous and erotic form of cinema.</td>
