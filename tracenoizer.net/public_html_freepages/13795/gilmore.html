 Barney's allegory-making mindset will always have a jump on us. " - Artforum New York-based artist Matthew Barney's Cremaster 2 is the newly released fourth work in his series of operatic films and installations. Loosely based on the final events in the life of Gary Gilmore (played by Barney), Cremaster 2 pivots on Gilmore's link with his alleged grandfather Harry Houdini (played by Norman Mailer, who chronicled Gilmore's life in The Executioner's Song). Shot on location in the Columbia Icefield of Canada and the Utah Salt Flats, Cremaster 2 interweaves genealogical ties and geographic terrain to invoke Gilmore's doomed misunderstanding of what it means to be an escape artist. Zimmerman Film Series is made possible by a gift from The LINC Group, Inc.</td>

 . Without that kind of coaching the film, while stunning to look at, defies narrative interpretation. For those who don't remember, Gary Gilmore was executed in 1976 for murdering two men on two consecutive nights. The case made history because it was the first execution in this country in ten years. More importantly, Gilmore refused the appeals process, demanding the right to die -- "blood atonement" in Morman doctrine -- for his sins.</td>
