 The audience simply wanders through the differences. When one encounters a stimulant that he is interested in, he should look at the methodology of each artist with a certain amount of discomfort. The possibility of presenting the body There is probably noone who misses the clear and bold intention of this exhibition. When we enter into a realm which cannot be solved with reason, we cannot easily find a simple answer or a method with which we are satisfied. We realize for the first time that we must reconsider at that point.</td>

 And the Brazilian artist Helio Oiticica argued that art has no autonomous object state, but is instead a searching process, a constructive nucleus, an enactment (1969). This is an idea that is also present in contemporary scientific developments in chaos theory and quantum physics. The artist's body is an art object that will not stay put and fixed in its role, it is contingent and gets up and walks back into the artist's life. As art object the artist's body is always ephemeral. The audiences for artists' body work are compelled to look with their own bodies, as well as their eyes, to feel on their pulses as well as rationalise and interpret.</td>

 ., Private collection Description This work is contained within the chilled space of a walkin fridge. The central piece, resembling body-building apparatus, is fabricated from frozen petroleum jelly. On the ceiling are mountain-climbing hooks, and on the floor a pink medical body implant. To what perverse use this equipment can be put is not clear, though the hooks do suggest the idea of bondage and restraint, while the implant illustrates the possibility of bodily transformation.</td>

 He has been making the Cremaster series of videos since 1994. Both of his knees were replaced due to injury, but he continued to play, despite excruciating pain. OTTOshaft developed out of Matthew Barney's obsession with this sporting hero, who epitomises a masochistic willingness to transform the body in pursuit of perfection. Like much of Barney's work, OTTOshaft combines video with an environment of fetishistic sculptural props; in this case resembling a deranged gym. The installation is divided into two parts containing an array of bizarre training equipment, which assume organic, even sexual forms.</td>
