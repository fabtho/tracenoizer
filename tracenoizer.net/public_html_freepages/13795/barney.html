 Gerry was not so perturbed by this and was very engaged by Barney's images, their outlandishness, imagination and subversion. . The panel ended up focussing on the work of Barney and Billingham. Mary and Eamonn were very taken by the photographs and video pieces from Billingham and the unsentimental depiction of his subjects. Despite their haphazard look of the works, there was evident art and affection at play.</td>

 This program is generously supported by Contemporary Extension, an auxiliary of SFMOMA. . Since 1994, Barney has completed three sections of the series-in-progress, beginning with Cremaster 4 (1994) and Cremaster 1 (1995), which will be the fourth and first films in the completed cycle. The Spring Film Program features the latest installment of his epic project, Cremaster 5, which will be the final film in the completed series. Through a montage of imagery and symbolically related events, Barney constructs a sinuous and erotic form of cinema.</td>
