 Those requirements might include (for example) attributes of security, reliability, performance, and survivability under a wide range of potential adversities. Security requirements typically might specify properties relating to integrity, confidentiality, and ability to withstand denial of service attacks. Trustworthiness can then be thought of as some sort of measure or indication of the likelihood that a given system, network, or component will satisfy its requirements. Less mathematically, we often say that a system is trustworthy (with respect to its desired requirements) with some level of assurance that it will behave as expected. This is very close to the European notion of dependability.</td>

 Just like their VCODE equivalents, the Java vector methods operate on the stack itself, popping their arguments and pushing their results. Note that this code assumes that the two argument arrays a and b have the same length. In the VCODE-to-Java system, Java throws an exception if a runtime length mismatch causes the shorter array bound to be over-stepped. For full protection, we could extend the method to throw an exception immediately if the two lengths are not equal. Many VCODE operations are defined only for segmented vectors, and require their arguments to have segment descriptors.</td>
