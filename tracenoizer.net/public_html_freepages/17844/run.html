 Our fourth deliverable (the first-year final report) will then represent a coherent synthesis of the first three reports, with additional material on assurance and architectures. Your feedback will be greatly appreciated throughout the project. As the discussion of principles evolves and becomes integrated with the composability document and the forthcoming architecture effort, somewhat greater formality is expected to infuse the entire analysis -- which in the long run is intended to enhance the assurance aspects of our CHATS project. However, the initial emphasis in this document version is to get the issues on the table for discussion within the CHATS program. Introduction Everything should be made as simple as possible -- but no simpler.</td>
