 Man she was a tough one too, she was half japanese. Tucson had a great scene back then, and Phoenix did too and was just up the road. Not to mention the drive out to LA for shows at perkins palace and the vex. Anyway, Karen was also an outspoken feminist and we even started to garner a hardcore-feminist-punk following of sorts, some group of women called the Fester Girls, out here in california. Regardless, Karen definately deserves to be on your page as Karen was a groundbreaker of sorts.</td>
