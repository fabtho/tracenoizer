 Day camps typically are more affordably priced because the camp does not have to provide lodging or multiple meals for the campers. Additionally, at a day camp, parents can closely monitor their children and keep up with any potential or ongoing problems, because the child returns home each day. Karen Allman, a district director for the Camp Fire USA First Texas Council since 1990, says that day camps are very effective at catering to younger children. "Parents of first- and second-graders may be more cautious about sending a child away from home," she says. "They enjoy the feel of a day camp, because they can have daily interaction with the people supervising their children.</td>
