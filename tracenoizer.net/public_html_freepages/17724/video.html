 Absolutely HUGE videos of dancing babies or silly things. If you are going to send something more than a picture, you should ask the person if they have seen it or if they want it beforehand. Nothin' worse than getting a 5 meg video of a frog-in-a-blender from 5 or 6 different friends. On the plus side, I get to watch a whole TV show while my mail downloads. If you are addicted to sending these type of emails to your whole address book or buddy list, please stop.</td>
