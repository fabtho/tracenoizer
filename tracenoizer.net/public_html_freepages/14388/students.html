 This list is like an ongoing electronic club meeting, and a major resource for participation in the club by its alumni worldwide. . ARCUA is open to students, faculty, and staff of the University of Arkansas. You need not be a licensed Amateur Radio Operator to join. In fact we welcome international (and domestic, of course) students who wish to use our facilities to listen to shortwave broadcasts.</td>
