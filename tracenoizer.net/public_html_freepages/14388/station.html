 If you would like to learn more about the fascinating world of Amateur Radio, please contact us. New photos of the April 2002 UTARC Club Meeting are online. The K5T Special Event Station, celebrating our 80th Anniversary, was a huge success. All requests for K5T QSL cards received so far have been processed and were mailed on 20 March 2002. Thanks to a generous donation by VE3NEA, we have a registered copy of DX Atlas for use in our club station N5XU.</td>

 Although it was a relatively laid-back event, the team managed to log a fair amount of contacts. ARRL International Earth-Moon-Earth Competition On Saturday and Sunday, Nov. 10 and 11, we will be operating a 144 MHz moonbounce station from the club shack at Site 530. This is our second chance to test the abilities of the large 2 meter az-el array that members have knocked themselves out to get operational over the past two years. Gary Lauterbach has constructed a new huge 2 meter amplifier that should allow us to work more stations (last time there were a number of stations heard that could not quite copy us).</td>

 A veteran of four space flights, he has logged over 932 hours in space. STS-55 also flew the Shuttle Amateur Radio Experiment (SAREX) making contact with students in 14 schools around the world. STS-71 (June 27 to July 7, 1995) was the first Space Shuttle mission to dock with the Russian Space Station Mir, and involved an exchange of crews (seven-member crew at launch, eight-member crew on return). The Atlantis Space Shuttle was modified to carry a docking system compatible with the Russian Mir Space Station. It also carried a Spacehab module in the payload bay in which the crew performed various life sciences experiments and data collections.</td>
