 . To begin with PORT was hosted by the List Visual Arts Centre (LVAC) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and organized by artnetweb, a New York-based collaborative. The conventional gallery venue at LVAC has now closed its doors but the exhibition, which set out to showcase the interactive and artistic potentiality of the internet, can still be experienced (in a limited capacity) on its special website. Consisting of numerous interactive real-time performances (scheduled in two hour time slots), the exhibition took place on four computer terminals at the LVAC Gallery and could be viewed by anybody with internet access regardless of their location. The gallery provided all the necessary technology for viewing the extensive list of international projects included in the show and assistants were on hand to help those physically visiting the gallery.</td>
