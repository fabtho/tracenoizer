Moreover,in order to understand how differently each penalty term works,an error surface evaluation is described. Finally,we show how cross-validation can be applied to find an optimal penalty factor. .">

 Section 1) is another example of utilizing this regularity. search to add literals until the clause covers as few negative instances as possible. The evaluation function used to guide the hill climbing search is an information theoretic measure. The former allows Foil to distinguish informative words from non informative ones, and the latter gives Foil the . In Tenth European Conference on Machine Learning, April 1998.</td>

 For children who are eligible under Part B of the IDEA, this is accomplished through the IEP process. For children determined to be handicapped under section 504, implementation of an individualized education program developed in accordance with Part B of the IDEA is one means of meeting the free appropriate public education requirements of the section 504 regulations. As part of the process of developing an individualized education program (IEP) for a child with disabilities under the IDEA, State and local education agencies must comply with the evaluation and placement regulations at 34 CFR 300. In meeting the indicidual education needs of children who are deaf under section 504, LEAs must comply with the evaluation and placement requirements of 34 CFR 104. 35 of the Section 504 regulation, which contains requirements similar to those of the IDEA.</td>
