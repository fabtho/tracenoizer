 The COED's report and its primary finding1 reflects a fundamental concern within much of the deaf community that students who are deaf have significant obstacles to overcome in order to have access to a free appropriate public education that meets their unique educational needs, particularly their communication and related needs2. The disability of deafness often results in significant and unique educational needs for the individual child. The major barriers to learning associated with deafness relate to language and communication, which, in turn, profoundly affect most aspects of the educational process. For example, acquiring basic English language skills is a tremendous challenge for most students who are deaf. While the Department and others are supporting research activites in the area of language acquisition for children who are deaf, effective methods of instruction that can be implemented in a variety of educational settings are still not available.</td>

 What and how the system will work in the future are not simple questions to answer. Ultimately the answers to the logistical and operational questions are driven by the values and philosophies of those charged with planning for the future. The purpose of this paper is to provide a framework against which this planning process might proceed. It articulates a mission that is driven by a vision of equal justice that empowers low income individuals and groups to define, promote and defend their legitimate interests through the civil justice system. The paper then identifies certain institutional values that flow naturally from the mission statement and which, in turn, lead to the identification of certain core operational capacities essential to any future organizational structures or service delivery configurations.</td>
