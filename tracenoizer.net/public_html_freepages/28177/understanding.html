If the afternoon service interferes with naptime or overextends your already frazzled child, then try an earlier, morning service, if this is an option in your church. And the rest of you, let's try to be a little more understanding. Save the censorious glances and comments in exchange for keeping your littlest members enrolled in their respective churches. They will grow older and learn what it's all about, if you just have a little patience and understanding.</td>
