 I explained the Eucharist so well that he said if I really believed that God came down upon the altar every time a priest said Mass, then I should be going to Mass each day. It was a challenge that struck home and I began to get up earlier and walk to Mass each morning. In the beginning it was easy and quite a thrill to get up early, but after a while I noticed that it became a struggle. It was not easy and I had no idea where it would lead. It was during my time with the YCW that I met my best friend.</td>
