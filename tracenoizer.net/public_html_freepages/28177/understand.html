 Giles is all I have left, I plan to hang onto him dearly. While I went to celebrate, even to do so subconsciously, she went to mourn, to think about all she's lost. I understand that while she's accomplished more than any other Slayer in history, she has also had to make more sacrifices. She's been the only Slayer to defeat so many things. She has a child's heart and soul, a love of all things innocent and beautiful, but her child's eyes are fouled every night by the constant death heaped upon her deceptively frail shoulders.</td>

 Pick one issue and stick to it even if you have to remind each other to stay on that one subject. It may be a symptom of a different problem that is not immediately obvious. Reaching understanding of the problem requires that you communicate with a joint desire to understand what the problem is. It does not require that you agree on any solutions at this time. Save your judgment for later when you are evaluating problem statements, ideas or options that you have created together.</td>
