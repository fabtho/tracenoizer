The back trajectory (back trajectories are explained in the Forecasting Pages) in the figure above shows the path of the air mass over the UK for the preceding 96 hours. The air over Southern England originated over over the continent, where it would have picked up the emissions from the industrial areas of Europe. the cleaner air over the North of the country travelled over the the Atlantic, hence lower concentrations were observed here. 10th - 12th August 1995 This episode is notable because of its geographical extent - high ozone concentrations were observed at almost all sites in the UK (with the exception of N.</td>
