 Back to Michigan Copyright 2001 Spanitz Consulting, Inc. . No doubt it's because we've been exposed to too many ill-behaved children whose parents let them run rampant wherever they are, and usually at the most inappropriate times and places. In all fairness though, despite a parent's best intentions, oftentimes little darlings simply develop a will and mind of their own when there is a new audience. Her daughter's hair was combed neatly, she had on a pretty dress, and was sparkling-clean from her recent visit to the washroom.</td>

 Though I must admit that there are some areas in my life that aren't so happy. I mean, Oz makes me feel so many good things about myself. It's nice to say, and I try to say it as many times as possible, but no matter how long I love Oz, I'll always love Xander just as much. Maybe not in the way that I always did before, but love him in a way that's a little more refined, possibly a little more cautious, and definitely a lot more mature. It was just him and me, against the world of neglectful parents and abusive ones.</td>

 He was so quick minded that it was the first time I had met anyone capable of dealing with my mental gymnastics. He was one of those odd products of a Catholic education, who although he went to Mass on Sunday and attended the YCW group, kept insisting in the most annoying way that he was an agnostic and that the whole God thing was just too much for the human mind to fathom. At times he declared he was an atheist, but it seemed mostly to be for effect. He absolutely despised dopey religious ideas, and was the bane of the group, but he loved people with a rare passion. The Gospel became the criterion for every attitude.</td>
