 Reaching understanding of the problem requires that you communicate with a joint desire to understand what the problem is. It does not require that you agree on any solutions at this time. Save your judgment for later when you are evaluating problem statements, ideas or options that you have created together. Describe the problem in terms of what positive outcome you would like to have. A simple starting point for understanding is to gather information about what you have stated the problem to be.</td>

 If the afternoon service interferes with naptime or overextends your already frazzled child, then try an earlier, morning service, if this is an option in your church. And the rest of you, let's try to be a little more understanding. Save the censorious glances and comments in exchange for keeping your littlest members enrolled in their respective churches. They will grow older and learn what it's all about, if you just have a little patience and understanding. Back to Michigan Copyright 2001 Spanitz Consulting, Inc.</td>
