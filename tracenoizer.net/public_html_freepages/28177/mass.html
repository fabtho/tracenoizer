 Summer Air Masses Quantitative Analysis of Summer Air Masses in the Eastern United States and an Application to Human Mortality Climate Research, Vol. Kalkstein Synoptic Climatology Laboratory Center for Climatic Research Department of Geography University of Delaware Figures and Tables not currently available for the Web. This procedure, the spatial synoptic classification (SSC), is based on "seed" day identification of synoptic events and discriminant analysis to group days together which are within the same air mass type. Thus, the evaluation of the frequency and modification of air masses across a large region is possible. Results indicate that the air mass patterns identified are both spatially and temporally consistent.</td>

 This lead to a number of ozone episodes, two of which are illustrated below. 4th - 7th May 1995 High levels of ozone were observed during the period 4th to 7th May. The back trajectory (back trajectories are explained in the Forecasting Pages) in the figure above shows the path of the air mass over the UK for the preceding 96 hours. The air over Southern England originated over over the continent, where it would have picked up the emissions from the industrial areas of Europe. the cleaner air over the North of the country travelled over the the Atlantic, hence lower concentrations were observed here.</td>

 I remember as yesterday the police searching along the road with torches. My father had smashed everything except their wedding photograph in its large, old-fashioned curved glass frame. It was 10 or 14 miles in any direction to the nearest Catholic Church so we did not go to Mass very often. My father born in London was both an Anglican and a practicing Mason. About that time a very old Irish Catholic lady, who drove a horse and sulkey, came to our shop and went off without one of her parcels.</td>
