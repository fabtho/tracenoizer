 With the recent attention given to foreclosure, there also has been corresponding interest in buying foreclosed properties. Foreclosed properties are very likely to be burdened with overdue taxes, liens and clouded title. A buyer should do his homework and ask a local title company for information concerning these outstanding liens and encumbrances. Title insurance may or may not be available following a foreclosure sale or various exceptions may be included in any title insurance policy issued to a buyer of a foreclosed property. Your local title company will be happy to provide additional information.</td>
