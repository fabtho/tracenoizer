Now real life experience tells us that in order to improve at a game we should play a broad variety of players, who are all experts. Now we have been supplied with Edgar, who is an expert but playing against him alone would mean we would produce expert anti-Edgar Othello players, and missing the broad variety. Playing against random players alone, would be equivalent of playing chess against only novices, we would become slightly better but we would miss having the experience of grand masters, and seeing their strategies in action.</td>
