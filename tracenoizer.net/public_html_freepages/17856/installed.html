The repaint of the new caret location will occur on the event thread in any case, as calls to modelToView are only safe on the event thread. The caret acts as a mouse and focus listener on the text component it has been installed in, and defines the caret semantics based upon those events. The listener methods can be reimplemented to change the semantics. By default, the first mouse button will be used to set focus and caret position.">
