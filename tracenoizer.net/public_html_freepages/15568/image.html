 Southwest Research Institute manages the IMAGE project and leads the IMAGE science investigation. . IMAGE is the first satellite mission dedicated to imaging the Earth's magnetosphere, the region of space controlled by the Earth's magnetic field and containing extremely tenuous plasmas of both solar and terrestrial origin. Invisible to standard astronomical observing techniques, these populations of ions and electrons have traditionally been studied by means of localized measurements with charged particle detectors, magnetometers, and electric field instruments. Instead of such in-situ measurements, IMAGE employs a variety of imaging techniques to "see the invisible" and to produce the first comprehensive global images of the plasma populations in the inner magnetosphere.</td>

 The images in the database are organised into SETS, with each set often representing a separate experimental study. . PICS Image Data Base Welcome To The Psychological Image Collection at Stirling (PICS) University of Stirling Psychology Department This is a collection of images useful for research in Psychology, such as sets of faces and objects. Please note that there are no pictures of anyone famous here, so don't waste your time and ours looking. The images in the database are organised into SETS, with each set often representing a separate experimental study.</td>
