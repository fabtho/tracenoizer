 Texas Tech is committed to carrying out state-of-the-art research in many different micro and nanotechnology areas. In the Fall of 1999, the Nano Tech Center was formed to capitalize on the growing interest in microsensors and microanalysis systems. Funding from the National Science Foundation supports a new course sequence in MEMS and Microanalysis Systems. ..</td>

 Well i guess you are right but then again i'm only a kid so what do i know. people i'm sure would be in furtive conversation about things like astral-projection or artificial intellegience. I like space talk, and would certainly have no objection to the forum being extended to cover speculation on any aspect of science (Which could cover almost anything). What would the powers that be (I know you are out there) have to say about it, and would it fit in with thier reason for running this place. However---I am of mixed feelings regarding bringing fiction in here.</td>
