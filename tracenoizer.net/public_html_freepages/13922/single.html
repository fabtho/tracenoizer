 Technology and the Media Asa Briggs The sense that the world is in the middle of a continuing communications revolution has been strong since the 1960s when television made its great breakthrough. It was not until the 19th century that the newspaper became the dominant pre-electronic medium, following in the wake of the pamphlet and the book and in the company of the periodical. It now became possible to combine thousands, later millions, of individual transistors on a single chip. They were thought of, like people, in terms of generations, with the distance between generations much smaller. Advanced countries, it was claimed, were evolving from an industrial to an information society.</td>

 Murray, head of physical sciences research at Lucent Technologies' Bell Laboratories. But visionaries are beginning to exploit the properties of molecules like buckyballs (above), which are made up of interlocking atoms of carbon. Researchers are building wires made from individual molecules and devices that work with the movement of single electrons, the first steps to supercomputers on a thumbnail, or shirt-button-size memories that could store all of human knowledge. In medicine, nanoparticles are being used to probe the workings of cells. Eventually, nanoprobes could spot--or even fix--glitches in single cells, turning genes on or off to conquer disease.</td>

The microscopic scanner has a range of about 75 microns, or the size of a single cell, UC Berkeley bioengineering professor Luke P. The device combines a microlens and scanner on a single 1-millimeter-square silicon chip. "We have shrunk a million-dollar machine down to a size that can balance on the tip of a ballpoint pen," Luke P.</td>
