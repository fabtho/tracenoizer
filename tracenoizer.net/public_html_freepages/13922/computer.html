 .Now I am looking for a new opportunities in the field of nanotech. Computer modeling was a black side of the Moon for my previous company because there was no appropriate budget. The Nano tech is still the buz word for the future, not for today's VCs. That is why I started to raise a lobby within nano techies to provide government support as well as it was done in the US, EU, Japan and Korea.</td>

 . I am considering going to grad school to get into Nanotechnology as applied to Molecular Biology. I have Electrical Engineering and Computer Science degrees from the University of Michigan. I have a notion of getting into a Materials Science program. Ideally I would like to design nano-machines that perform intracellular operations.</td>

 Now, realize that with nanotechnology we could shrink components down to . Chips would be exponentially faster, more efficient, and powerful than anything on the drawing board today. One such rumor is of a molecular device capable of functioning as RAM in a nano-computer. The impact would be tremendous on the scientific and commercial communities. A near-term application in 2-5 years might be a DVD-like movie stored in a space half the size of today's semiconductor chips.</td>
