 Funding from the National Science Foundation supports a new course sequence in MEMS and Microanalysis Systems. . Texas Tech is committed to carrying out state-of-the-art research in many different micro and nanotechnology areas. In the Fall of 1999, the Nano Tech Center was formed to capitalize on the growing interest in microsensors and microanalysis systems.

 For investors and entrepreneurs hoping to seize their share of the pie, it is critically important to understand in detail where and when the most interesting market opportunities are likely to emerge. European governments poured more than 184 million euros into nanotechnology in 2000, and this number is expected to grow to 1. In this session, some of the leading European government and private small tech experts discuss the opportunities for research, commercialization and investment in Europe and outline the European small tech environment. Local and regional organizations are beginning to take notice of the economic development opportunities offered by the small tech industry. The Human Genome Project, bioterrorism and the promise of remarkable new drugs and therapies based on small tech innovations have attracted the attention of politicians, media, and scientists and caught the imagination of the general public.</td>
