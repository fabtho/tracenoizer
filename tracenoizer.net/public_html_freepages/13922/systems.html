 . Texas Tech is committed to carrying out state-of-the-art research in many different micro and nanotechnology areas. In the Fall of 1999, the Nano Tech Center was formed to capitalize on the growing interest in microsensors and microanalysis systems. Funding from the National Science Foundation supports a new course sequence in MEMS and Microanalysis Systems. .</td>

 Some other links to related research groups (c),12. . The Idea During last ten years there has been a rapidly rising interest in effects taking place in systems with very small tunnel junctions of sub micron size at temperatures of 100 mK. The quantum nature of electron charge state leads to devices which manifest single electron effects. The basic device is the single electron transistor (SET), which consists of an island isolated by two tunnel junctions.</td>

 . Texas Tech University has an established Nano Tech Center that has Optoelectronics, Microelectronics and Microsensors as its focus. Applications are encouraged from candidates working in research related to nanofabrication of electronic and photonic devices, or microfabrication of microelectric mechanical systems (MEMS), chemical sensors and biosensors. Appointment can be at the Assistant, Associate or, Full Professor level, depending upon the qualifications of the candidate. in physics or a closely related field, industrial or national laboratory experience would be favorable.</td>
