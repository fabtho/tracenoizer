 Cooling below the air's dew point releases condensation first as cloud, and if uplift and cooling continues, as rain, hail or snow. . Cooling Air Cooling Air Many of the common phenomena of weather - clouds, frost, fog and rain - are due to the cooling of air and the consequent condensation of excess water vapour. A common form of contact cooling is radiation cooling. When the Sun sets, the Earth and any other radiating body upon it continue to radiate heat from their supplies.</td>

 Unfortunately, most cars don't overheat in the winter. . Cooling Systems Cooling System Overview Below is an explanation of this system's operation Visit The Service Department To Submit Your Problem Or Question Click Here For A More Detailed Graphic And Operation Of This System Click Here To Return To The Auto101 Index The Cooling System The purpose of the engine's cooling system is to remove excess heat from the engine, to keep the engine operating at its most efficient temperature, and to get the engine up to the correct temperature as soon as possible after starting. Ideally, the cooling system keeps the engine running at its most efficient temperature no matter what the operating conditions are. As fuel is burned in the engine, about one-third of the energy in the fuel is converted into power.</td>
