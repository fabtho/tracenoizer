 The humidity calculations page now has the detailed formulas for calculating the heat index, or apparent temperature. . Hot, humid weather is not only uncomfortable, it's dangerous to those exercising in it. For example, if the temperature is 95 and the relative humidity is 50 percent, find 95 in the temperature column on the left side, follow that row to the right to the 50 percent humidity column. The colors on the chart show the level of danger of various combinations.</td>
