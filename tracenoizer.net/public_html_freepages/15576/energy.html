 Black surfaces are generally good emitters and absorbers, while silvery metal surfaces are poor emitters and absorbers. .1 Temperature We have already seen that the average kinetic energy of the molecules in a gas is proportional to the absolute temperature of the gas. In a solid, the atoms can move randomly about their equilibrium positions. In addition, the solid as a whole can move with a given velocity and have ordered kinetic energy.</td>

 The document was produced by the Technical Information Program, under the DOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. . Cities Cut Water System Energy Costs Cities Cut Water System Energy Costs Water distribution can be the largest single component of energy use by local governments. Using Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, many cities are slashing these energy costs. A growing number of cities are trimming the energy appetites of their water departments by using SCADA systems.</td>
