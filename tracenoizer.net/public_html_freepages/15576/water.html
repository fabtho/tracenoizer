<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" . In this view of a lava entry point, the concentric color pattern visible on the ocean's surface represents several distinct temperature zones. Water is heated at the lava-entry point and moves outward until the long-shore current carries it south along the coast of Kilauea (away from camera). The brown color results from high concentrations of suspended glass fragments broken from cooling lava and from occasional gelatinous zooplankton. This is the coolest water near the lava-entry point.">

 , so we know that water temperatures from near-shore sites differ from temperatures offshore. . NDBC Science Pages Does water temperature differ between near-shore and offshore sites. The graph shows the average monthly water temperatures from Station 46029 and Station 46005. These two stations are on the same latitude -- about 46 degrees North latitude.</td>

 This is when the water molecules are basically not moving. . After water changes from a liquid to a gas (at 212 degrees Fahrenheit) it can actually heat up much hotter than that. In the gas form, water molecules are spread out and have a lot of room to move and get much hotter than the other two phases (liquid and ice). But it can actually get colder than that, all the way to what we call AbSOLUTE ZERO.</td>
