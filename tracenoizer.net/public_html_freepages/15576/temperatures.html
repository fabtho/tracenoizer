 As a result, inland climates are subject to more extreme temperature ranges than coastal climates, which are insulated by nearby water. . Although land and air temperatures vary dramatically within a day, water temperatures are much more stable. Therefore, average water temperatures can give you a pretty good idea of what to expect at the beach weeks (or even months) into the future, thus making it easier to plan beach activities (such as swimming and fishing). NOAA's National Ocean Data Center's Coastal Water Temperature Guide (CWTG) provides both present temperatures and climatological averages in degrees Fahrenheit.</td>
