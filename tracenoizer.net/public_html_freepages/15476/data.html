 We also operate several computer labs, with facilities for extracting, translating and statistically analyzing data. . The Harvard-MIT Data Center is the principal distributor of quantitative social science data at Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. We maintain a large library of electronic data from all these sources, a growing collection of unique data sets, and an extensive codebook library. Few other university data centers approach the quantity of social science data that passes through here on a regular basis.</td>
