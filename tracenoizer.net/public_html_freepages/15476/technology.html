 APA Committee on Computer Activities APA Committee on Computer Activities The APA Statement of Computer Support is an official APA policy statement. In addition to setting forth general principles, this document may be helpful in supporting departmental requests for computer hardware and services, or in cases where promotion or hire is in part dependent upon technological contributions. The Classics, Technology, and Teaching Subcommittee (CTTS) (est. February 1996) seeks to facilitate national curricular and pedagogical collaboration among classics programs, particularly smaller programs, through various electronic media and technologies. As a first step, the committee has set up CLSTECH, a discussion list designated for sharing information and promoting collaboration in these areas.</td>
