 . Remember to print your confirmation and take it with you to the seminar. Building on the strength of a wide range of fall quarter events such as Welcome Week and the Buckeye Book Community, First Year Experience events keep rolling into winter quarter. You asked for success series topics relevant to life during the first year on campus, and we listened by creating all new discussion material. We're here to make sure your Ohio State Experience starts out on the right foot.</td>
