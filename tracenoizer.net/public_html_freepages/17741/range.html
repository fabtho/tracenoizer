 A founding member of the ASP and its original Secretary. Simtel Undoubtedly the largest public-access library of shareware.

 This gig celebrates the launch of their new album 'The Brothel To The Cemetery'. Imagine Kurt Weill conjuring up images of prewar Berlin while a falsetto vocalist screams, squeaks and squawks his way through every number like some rambling madman, and you've got the picture. Their lyrics range from the subtle romanticism of 'Sailors'; to the outright blasphemous ('I'm crucifying Jesus, nail him to the cross, the poor old bastard bleeds to death and I don't give a toss. Apparently "It's grim up north but it's grimmer than that in Slough, I'll sing you a song if you drop a bomb on Slough". It's funny, weird, disturbing stuff and should make for a great evening, though perhaps not for born agains or the inhabitants of Slough for that matter.</td>
