 Lawrence (1983) and the heavy in Robert Longo's Johnny Mnemonic (1995). Film buffs prize the six movies Kitano has directed since his 1989 Violent Cop - appearing in five of them as a stolid, somewhat shambling bruiser so square that he's cool. Slightly quizzical, smiling no more than once or twice a movie, Kitano is most expressive when he's socking someone. (In Japan, Jolt supercaffeinated soda chose him as its corporate spokesman. ) Given the havoc he wreaks in character, however, Kitano is a surprisingly classical filmmaker, making exceedingly precise use of camera placement and postdubbed sound.</td>

 Although Sonatine is widely regarded as the best of Kitano's crime movies, I often find myself admiring this film more merely for its sheer rawness. They decide they need guns and it's here that they come across Kitano, who portrays a mean spirited rogue (and possibly homosexual) gangster who helps them buy and smuggle the firearms back to Japan. Much of the first half of the movie is set-up but once Kitano enters the picture it becomes more of what one would expect from a Kitano yakuza crime picture with the traditional sadistic creulty and executions. Kitano's choice of pitting a baseball team against yakuza provides an interesting comparison of two different variations on the japanese concept of teamwork. Not one of his stronger movies, it seems more like an exercise before his masterful Sonatine.</td>

 Thankfully, he seems to be making a recovery and has a new film this year entitled Kids Return, which focuses on a couple of high school drop-outs. His more recent acting jobs include the one-eyed gay hitman in the film Gonin. (courtesy of the Internet Movie Database) Kitano on Video Although his work is not yet currently availible on the US mainstream video market, at least three of his movies (Violent Cop, Boiling Point, Sonatine) are currently availible on VHS PAL in the UK. However, if you are PAL-challenged, you can still find some of his stuff on NTSC videotapes and discs in Japan. Below is some (hopfully) helpful ordering information for the japanese laserdiscs that I know of.</td>
