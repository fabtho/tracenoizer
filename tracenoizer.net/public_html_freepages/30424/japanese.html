 Outside of these titles, his best work is nowhere to be found on American video shelves, but that may soon change now that Quentin Tarantino's Rolling Thunder Company has expressed interest in importing some of his films under the Miramax label. Kitano first started out as part of a stand-up comedic duo called "The Two Beats" (hence his nickname). He was eventually discovered by a japanese TV producer and gradually became one of the most popular TV personalities in Japan- it is said that he can be found on up to 8 different TV shows a week. As a film director, he has a very unique visual style which can seem very alienating to the western eye. Although I have only seen 3 of his films ("Violent Cop", "Boiling Point", and "Sonatine"), I have yet to be disappointed with any of his works.</td>

 They decide they need guns and it's here that they come across Kitano, who portrays a mean spirited rogue (and possibly homosexual) gangster who helps them buy and smuggle the firearms back to Japan. Much of the first half of the movie is set-up but once Kitano enters the picture it becomes more of what one would expect from a Kitano yakuza crime picture with the traditional sadistic creulty and executions. Kitano's choice of pitting a baseball team against yakuza provides an interesting comparison of two different variations on the japanese concept of teamwork. Not one of his stronger movies, it seems more like an exercise before his masterful Sonatine. Kitano has said in interviews that he believes movies should not have to rely on excess dialog when visuals can adequately tell a story; this film is definite proof of that.</td>
