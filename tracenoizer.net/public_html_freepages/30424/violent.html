 This unique amalgam of Clint Eastwood and Howard Stern is best known stateside for playing the affably brutal Sergeant Ham in Nagisa Oshima's Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence (1983) and the heavy in Robert Longo's Johnny Mnemonic (1995). Film buffs prize the six movies Kitano has directed since his 1989 Violent Cop - appearing in five of them as a stolid, somewhat shambling bruiser so square that he's cool. Slightly quizzical, smiling no more than once or twice a movie, Kitano is most expressive when he's socking someone. (In Japan, Jolt supercaffeinated soda chose him as its corporate spokesman.</td>

 He was eventually discovered by a japanese TV producer and gradually became one of the most popular TV personalities in Japan- it is said that he can be found on up to 8 different TV shows a week. As a film director, he has a very unique visual style which can seem very alienating to the western eye. Although I have only seen 3 of his films ("Violent Cop", "Boiling Point", and "Sonatine"), I have yet to be disappointed with any of his works. In more recent news, Kitano was involved in a motorcycle accident which paralyzed the right half of his face. Thankfully, he seems to be making a recovery and has a new film this year entitled Kids Return, which focuses on a couple of high school drop-outs.</td>
