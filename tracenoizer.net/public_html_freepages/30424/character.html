 Slightly quizzical, smiling no more than once or twice a movie, Kitano is most expressive when he's socking someone. (In Japan, Jolt supercaffeinated soda chose him as its corporate spokesman. ) Given the havoc he wreaks in character, however, Kitano is a surprisingly classical filmmaker, making exceedingly precise use of camera placement and postdubbed sound. Along with a fondness for one-shot scenes, Kitano's specialty is scenes depicting startling eruptions of Impassively watched, noncathartic violence. A bloody gunfight is as likely to occur inside a crowded elevator as it is to be shown in extreme long shot, illuminating the darkened rooms of a high-rise office suite like a distant electrical storm.</td>

 There is a particularly interesting shootout between 5 people in a crowded elevator- this scene alone makes this film worth checking out 8-). . The beginning of this film pretty much establishes what kind of character Kitano plays. A pack of youths are seen beating an old bum to death, but it is only until after the act that Kitano's character decides to step in. He follows one of the youths home, politely asks his mother to see him, and then savagely proceeds to beat a confession out of the kid.</td>
