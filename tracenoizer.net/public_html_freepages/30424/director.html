 Those expecting a violent Kitano crime movie a la Violent Cop or Sonatine will probably be sorely disappointed because this movie could not be more of a departure. Instead, it is a bittersweet story about a young man's love for both surfing and his girlfriend (although more emphasis seems to be placed on the former 8-)). Those who can appreciate Kitano as a director will probably be pleasantly surprised that such a tranquil film could be made by a man who seems to revel in gangland torture scenes. After a shootout, Kitano's character retreats to a remote beach along with some of his lackeys to lay low for a while, but gradually we learn there is more to the whole gang war than meets the eye. Unlike Violent Cop, which seemed to be driven almost entirely by its sheer savagery, Sonatine takes that violent intensity but also adds more time to develop the characters (particularly while Kitano's group is stuck on the beach).</td>

 Kitano first started out as part of a stand-up comedic duo called "The Two Beats" (hence his nickname). He was eventually discovered by a japanese TV producer and gradually became one of the most popular TV personalities in Japan- it is said that he can be found on up to 8 different TV shows a week. As a film director, he has a very unique visual style which can seem very alienating to the western eye. Although I have only seen 3 of his films ("Violent Cop", "Boiling Point", and "Sonatine"), I have yet to be disappointed with any of his works. In more recent news, Kitano was involved in a motorcycle accident which paralyzed the right half of his face.</td>
