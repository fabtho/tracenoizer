 He was Head of Department at Heriot-Watt for the period 1984-89, and Dean of the Faculty of Science 1998-2001. He was visiting fellow at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, Oct-Dec. His current research interests are in the study of solitons, both in the numerical study of solitons on lattices, and the use of computer algebra to study exact periodic and quasiperiodic solutions of soliton and soliton-related problems in mathematical physics. One lattice equation which he has worked on a lot is the Discrete Self-Trapping equation, a generalized discrete Nonlinear Schroedinger equation. Recently he has worked with Russell, Marin and Cruzeiro-Hansson in studies of localised lattice modes and applications to HTc.</td>
