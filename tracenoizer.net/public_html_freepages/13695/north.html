 These are adapted from study guides submitted by Saint Benedict's Monastery of Saint Joseph, Minnesota; Saint Scholastica Monastery of Fort Smith, Arkansas; and the Federation of Saint Scholastica. Appendix B contains the names of the original committee members and update authors. Appendix C is a diagram of the North American monasteries of Benedictine women.

These resources may be found in the Conference archives at Atchison.</td>
