 I want to tell you about my boys, Anthony and Dalton. You see, both of my boys were diagnosed with Krabbe disease, which is a rare genetics disorder that is proven fatal. Unlike most children with infantile Krabbe, Dalton has had a second chance at life. He received a bone marrow transplant at 2 month old from his twin sister, Dakota, in order to try to replace an enzyme his brain wasn't able to make. Dalton is now 4 years old and as to date, his transplant has been a success.</td>
