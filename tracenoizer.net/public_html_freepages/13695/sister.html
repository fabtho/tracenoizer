I was telling him how I was going to take him to buy his first pair of sandals later that day and that his then 20 month old sister Dakota would help us pick them out. We tried CPR and called 911 and somehow I knew my boy was gone. I was there, but it was like my body was on the outside looking in and when that doctor came in and said "I'm sorry," my life changed in the deepest saddest way forever.</td>
