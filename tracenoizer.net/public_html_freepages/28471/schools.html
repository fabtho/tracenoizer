 . The closing of more than a dozen graduate programs in library science from the late 70s to the early 90s raised this concern to an even higher level. Many librarians assumed that higher education as a whole had no respect for librarianship when the most prestigious and well-regarded library schools at Columbia and Chicago were closed.

 The principal, along with the school health nurse or the designated public health nurse, will be responsible for the establishment of a safe method of storage for medication and for the administration of such medication in accordance with procedures developed by the superintendent in consultation with appropriate health department officials. . In general, the administration of medication to students while they are in the schools is to be discouraged. Treatment schedules which allow doses to be given at times other than during the school hours are preferred and encouraged. However, when in the opinion of the prescribing physician it is necessary for the patient's best interest that medication be given during school hours, such medication may be administered in accordance with procedures developed by the superintendent in consultation with appropriate health department officials.</td>
