 We would request that this re-evaluation be conducted in such a way as to be able to bring the referendum to a vote on or before Oct. . Yale ASSEMBLY of Graduate Students - Policy Dean Hockfield, The Assembly has decided to ask that you delay the referendum on the GSA Charter until this fall. We are acutely aware that you and the charter review committee have put a great deal of time and effort into preparing the referendum by the end of this semester. We also have considered the existing charter's provision that a referendum should be held in the current semester.</td>

All universities have a responsibility to assist you with arranging accommodation. You will usually receive information soon after being accepted.</td>
