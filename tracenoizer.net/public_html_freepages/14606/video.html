Each group of children was brought to the playroom for 20 minutes of free play for 5 days. Your child is going to love starring in a personlized video with Barney or Arthur. Parallel play was the predominant level of play observed across both toy conditions.

 Even though this is for kids, Barney, BJ and Baby Bop's tour of the zoo and their description of each animal is very interesting as well as adorable. Barney's cheerful, polite and gentle demeanor are a beautiful example for any child. I must say, in all aspects this video is beautifully produced. My children (17 months old) love Barney and the gang but no children were included in this video. They lost interest in it very quickly which is unusual for a Barney video.</td>

 . your child will learn to respect himself and others. Do you really think that children are going to learn values, their basic morals, from a stupid video featuring a giant purple dinosaur. How did cavemen teach their children self-repsect when they didn't have VCRs. Regardless of the video's merits (more on that later), you can't fix the problems with your children by plugging them into a TV.</td>
