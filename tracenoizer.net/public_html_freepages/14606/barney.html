 Leach had dreamed of creating educational and entertaining videos for preschool children. Initially, they envisioned the main character to be a cuddly bear which comes to life. The first Barney home videos were released in 1988. In 1991, a Barney video was rented from a Connecticut video store for four-year-old Leora Rifkin, the daughter of Larry Rifkin. Rifkin happened to be the executive vice president of programming for Connecticut Public Television.</td>
