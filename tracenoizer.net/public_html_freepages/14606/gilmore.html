 . The story unfolds in a series of stunning and surreal scenes that are narratively obscure and visually persuasive. The scene immediately preceding when Gilmore murders the gas station attendant and thus begins his infamous killing spree, has him parked in a shiny Mustang that is seamlessly connected to another Mustang by a tunnel linking the two cars. The tightly-corseted grandmother of Gilmore conducts a seance with her son and his fiance in which Gilmore is conceived to the buzzing of thousands of bees. That Gilmore was the first person to be executed in the United Sates after the reinstitution of the death penalty also contributes to the complex martyrdom (political and moral) with which both Barney and Mailer surround his death.</td>

 I think I was thrown by the paragraph formation (every paragraph is an entity unto itself), and the fact that, despite what I'd heard, I didn't find it. It doesn't compare with Truman Capote's In Cold Blood, for example, where we got into the heads of both killers and victims. Here the focus is on Gary Gilmore and his lover Nicole. Something creepy genuinely occurs when the victims appear--the roundabout way their lives intersect with Gary Gilmore's--but just as quickly they are gone and the focus becomes Gilmore once again. It's as if the claims that, in the media glare surrounding the execution of Gary Gilmore, the victims were forgotten apply to this book as well.</td>
