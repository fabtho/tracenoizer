 The students earned Cisco Certified Network Associate certificates - the same as that awarded to students at many US universities and high schools - after graduating from the University of Dar es Salaam computing centre, according to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), which is supporting the programme. The programme, which it is proposed to expand throughout the country, is intended to help Tanzania increase the number of ICT professionals able to solve technical problems in the workplace and help make organisations more efficient. Through the initiative, Cisco provides training materials, and UNDP helps make the programme affordable. "The beauty of this programme is that it does not require any prior knowledge of computers or networks," said UNDP project officer Riku Asikainen, adding that the advantages to the students were far-reaching. The project includes employment counselling, and many graduates are expected to find jobs managing small and medium-sized computer networks for Tanzanian businesses and public institutions, according to the agency.</td>
