 How do I change the source of the data to be projected (for example from imported TurboTax data to Quicken data). How can I check if the Tax Profile data has been correctly projected from my information. To view your Tax Profile data, select the Taxes menu, and select Tax Profile. You can also view projections based on Tax Profile data in the Tax Planner. The Quicken Tax Profile has precedence rules for the source of data it chooses to display.</td>

 For more information about the C-CAP Data Handler, see the "ArcView Extensions" Web page. The Center recognizes that some users may not have access to ESRI's Spatial Analyst extension. These users can still view the data in ArcView, although they will not be able to see a legend. To view data in ArcView, select File, Extension, Imagine Support and then add your image to the view. In order to enhance functionality to non-Spatial Analyst users, the Center is developing a C-CAP Legend Handler extension.</td>
