 Also discusses the major DSSs in the North American network, and his own generic model in the context of up-and-coming trends. , Portland, OR All rights reserved Book Description Digital switching system reliability is the ultimate gating factor in the continued expansion of the Internet, and a key competitive differentiator in the deregulated telecommunications market. This authoritative book enables telecommunications design engineers, service providers, and reliability and software engineers to gain a more complete understanding of digital switching systems and how to upgrade digital switching system reliability in their organizations. Many people who have traveled abroad to another countries have commented on this, but few people actually understand why this is so. This book has given me some new insights as to why this is the case.</td>

 Also, the pressure variations are significantly higher in commercial vehicles as a result of more severe loading and driving conditions. Therefore, the complex algorithm developed by MICHELIN experts takes into account these wide pressure variations to evaluate pressure deviations such as threshold values or pressure losses over time, etc. By the very design of the system, this procedure guarantees a higher level of accuracy and reliability than in systems based on the wheel speed. As a result, IVTM can detect even the smallest pressure losses, even the not infrequent pressure loss which occurs on two or more tires at once and in twin tires. The tire inflation pressure is even measured when the vehicle is stationary.</td>
