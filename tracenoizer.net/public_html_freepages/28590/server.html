<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" Automatic alarm systems notify our staff of any system failure on a 24 hour basis. A continuous streaming tape backup system ensures against catastrophic failure. This means that if your host server fails, the second 'mirror' server will automatically take over within seconds of the event and notify our staff accordingly. It also means that during routine operation, if your server suddenly experiences peak traffic loads, the second server will automatically take over delivery of your site. Should a power failure continue for an extended period of time, a generator automatically provides power for continuous operation.">

 you have a need for a client application that will be a native Windows application, for whatever reason. (2) they need to work in disconnected mode, or talk to local hardware, so a web application won't work. How do you write server code in Java (in EJBs, for example) but access it easily from a native Windows clients, for example a Delphi application. This will be nearly impossible, since it is built on Java object serialization. This defeated the goal of keeping the client lean, though.</td>

 ISPs need accurate time information in log lines that are sent as abuse reports so that they can identify exactly when a suspected attacker was logged in. Configure your machine Check you machine to see that its time settings are configured properly. Set your clock Use a time setting utility to syncronize your machine's clock with an external time server. I've had good luck with AboutTime, which is available from here. To maintain your clock's accuracy, configure AboutTime to run from the taskbar and to periodically set the time.</td>
