 . Slater replied to a petition from American Trucking Associations by saying that the research was already publicly available. He also said there had been, and will continue to be, ample opportunity for public comment and involvement in crafting regulations to replace the existing, 62-year-old hours of service rules. The refusal of that request should clear the way for the appearance of the long-awaited rulemaking. 5 asking the agency to give the public the opportunity to review the research it was basing the new rules upon (8-9, p.</td>

 IVTM Reduces Costs As manual tire pressure checks are tiresome and dirty, they are neglected all too frequently. This results in increased rolling resistance leading to higher fuel consumption. In addition, even when the tire pressure is only slightly incorrect, the consequences include increased flexing energy which results in a significantly reduced tire service life. IVTM helps you to keep tire pressures at optimum levels, thereby cutting fuel and tire costs in the long-term. Furthermore, IVTM avoids the need for costly, manual tire pressure checks.</td>
