 Her productions for National Public Radio were among the first radio art works broadcast nationally. Her recent programs have been aired nationally and internationally in over fifteen countries. In them, Thorington explores the possibility of non-textual narratives, and often uses sound to shape "mind-scapes", or cinematic sound plays. The exploration of the spatial dimensions in the (immaterial) electronic medium is central to all her work. .</td>
