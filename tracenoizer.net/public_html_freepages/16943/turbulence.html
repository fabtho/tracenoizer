 Slowly documentary and drama, experimental work, experimental music have all disappeared from the public radio system. So lacking access and combining with that the diminished funding for the arts in America I became convinced that I better look somewhere else. I began to look at the new media and I developed the Turbulence web site, where we commission artists to create for the web medium. At the same time I did an archive of the New American Radio series. You can hear audio excerpts, read scripts, some scores and artists' writings on radio and their experience in radio.</td>
