Our approach is to address software engineering issues as an integrated whole in ways that incrementally interact with each other and with the user. For example, the system will notice the user's reactions to sample values she tests, and will then suggest general principles about the spreadsheet, encouraging the user to refine or modify the suggestions.</td>
