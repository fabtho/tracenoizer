 The number of cities with a population of more than a million will also double, from 23 in 1992 to 49 by 2001. Related to these statistics are tremendous pressures on the urban infrastructure and the severe deterioration in the quality of urban environment. This can be in form of measuring, and reporting the performance of an institution with respect to its service delivery. Performance measurement could be defined as 'evaluation of policy through a well-defined set of indicators termed as performance indicators'. To address some of these problems, TERI has started an initiative called USERS (Urban Services Environmental Rating System).</td>

 4 System Accounts System users are those used to run services such as DNS, mail, web servers, and so forth. The reason for this is security; if all services ran as the superuser, they could act without restriction. Examples of system users are daemon, operator, bind (for the Domain Name Service), and news. Often sysadmins create httpd to run web servers they install. However, it is important to keep in mind that the more services that use nobody, the more files and processes that user will become associated with, and hence the more privileged that user becomes.</td>
