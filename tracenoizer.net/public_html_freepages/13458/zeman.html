Conference Homepage Weak squares, and large cardinals between superstrong and supercompact presented by Martin Zeman University of California, Irvine I will discuss various weak versions of the square principle. I will introduce large cardinal axioms which can still prove the failure of weak square principles and which are candidates for optimal hypotheses for this task.
