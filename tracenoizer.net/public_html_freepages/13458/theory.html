 --- Lehigh University Set theory, mathematical logic Stanley, Maurice C. . Set Theory homepages Set Theory This list of homepages of set theorists was inspired by Computability Theory , maintained by Peter Cholak with encouragement from Ted Slaman. It is complemented by Andrzej Roslanowski's sleek list, and by Herb Enderton's ASL-web, links to ASL members. In May 2001, Hugh Woodin use PPower4 to create slides displayed by computer from a latex file for his talk at the MSRI Workshop, The Continuum Hypothesis.</td>

 . Zeman, Inner Models and Large Cardinals Zeman, Martin Inner Models and Large Cardinals 2002. The monograph contains a detailed presentation of general fine structure theory as well as a modern approach to the construction of small core models, namely those models containing at most one strong cardinal, together with some of their applications. The final part of the book is devoted to a new approach encompassing large inner models which admit many Woodin cardinals. The exposition is self-contained and does not assume any special prerequisities, which should make the text comprehensible not only to specialists but also to advanced students in Mathematical Logic and Set Theory.</td>
