At the moment, we are trying to concentrate on the time after 1990. We grouped the Alumni into "Members of the Group" (this includes former guests, former employees, and former students who had a student job), "PhD students" and "Master's students".</td>

 In May 2001, Hugh Woodin use PPower4 to create slides displayed by computer from a latex file for his talk at the MSRI Workshop, The Continuum Hypothesis. See also some special topics and a few links to history of set theory. journals and groups and conferences in logic and set theory. --- University of South Carolina Descriptive set theory and the axiom of determinacy. --- University of Wisconsin, Madison set theory, especially independence and consistency results in axiomatic set theory using the method of forcing Mitchell, William J.</td>

 The monograph contains a detailed presentation of general fine structure theory as well as a modern approach to the construction of small core models, namely those models containing at most one strong cardinal, together with some of their applications. The final part of the book is devoted to a new approach encompassing large inner models which admit many Woodin cardinals. The exposition is self-contained and does not assume any special prerequisities, which should make the text comprehensible not only to specialists but also to advanced students in Mathematical Logic and Set Theory. ..</td>
