 I think that's the reason why the Packers are as successful as they have been under his tenure. Taking over a club which had finished with a dismal 4-and-12 record in 1991, Holmgren saw his first team lose five of its first seven games in his baptismal, '92 season. Rebounding from that early adversity, he led his first three Packers teams to as many consecutive 9-and-7 records, a span of success Green Bay had not known since the now-distant "Lombardi Era. " The 50-year-old San Franciscan embellished these accomplishments by escorting the Green and Gold to an 11-5 mark in 1995 - the 11 victories representing the third-highest such total in team annals - and to its first NFC Central Division championship in 23 years, then guiding his squad to back-to-back wild-card and divisional playoff victories in the postseason and a berth in the National Football Conference title game for the first time since 1967. When the Packers saw the Cowboys come from behind to prevail in the latter contest at Dallas, Holmgren made a promise to his players in the somber visitors' dressing room at Texas Stadium.</td>
