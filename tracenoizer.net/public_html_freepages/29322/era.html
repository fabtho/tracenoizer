 But those storied icons, who had the "stage" to themselves for decades, are mutually exclusive no longer, historically speaking. Holmgren formally joined them in the team's pantheon of elite following a hallmark 1996 season, one majestically crowned by a Super Bowl title - the Packers' first in 29 years - and further established himself in their company by leading the Green and Gold to a second consecutive Super Bowl appearance last January. Surpassing the legendary Lombardi's success in Lambeau Field en route, he thus has forged a substantial niche in Packers archives for all time, becoming the third head coach in team annals to bring a world championship to what had come to be known as Titletown in an earlier era. Prior to that signal accomplishment, he already occupied a lofty plateau in the team's rich and proud history, having become just the third field leader in the club's lengthy existence to own a winning record - a distinction he also shares with Lambeau and Lombardi. A Californian born and bred, Holmgren had left the picturesque hills and haute cuisine of his native San Francisco in 1992 to take on a classic challenge in Green Bay, the smallest city in the National Football League.</td>
