 But those storied icons, who had the "stage" to themselves for decades, are mutually exclusive no longer, historically speaking. Holmgren formally joined them in the team's pantheon of elite following a hallmark 1996 season, one majestically crowned by a Super Bowl title - the Packers' first in 29 years - and further established himself in their company by leading the Green and Gold to a second consecutive Super Bowl appearance last January. Surpassing the legendary Lombardi's success in Lambeau Field en route, he thus has forged a substantial niche in Packers archives for all time, becoming the third head coach in team annals to bring a world championship to what had come to be known as Titletown in an earlier era. Prior to that signal accomplishment, he already occupied a lofty plateau in the team's rich and proud history, having become just the third field leader in the club's lengthy existence to own a winning record - a distinction he also shares with Lambeau and Lombardi. A Californian born and bred, Holmgren had left the picturesque hills and haute cuisine of his native San Francisco in 1992 to take on a classic challenge in Green Bay, the smallest city in the National Football League.</td>

 It's always tough to know who will do what, and where, but isn't that the beauty of the draft anyways. Regular diamond notes took us into the fond memories of Jack Buck, Pedro Martinez returning to his Cy Young form, Luis Castillo's streak and of course even a brief mention of the fun that is the labor issues. A parade honoring the Lakers for yet another NBA championship. Much has been written and said about Phil Jackson tying Red Auerbach's record of winning nine NBA titles as a coach. How come this hasn't been the case with Detroit Red Wings coach Scotty Bowman.</td>
