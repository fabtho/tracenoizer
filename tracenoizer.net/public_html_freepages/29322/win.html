 Of course some of the conversation focused on a guy named Tiger Woods, who "can become the greatest golfer of all time, if he keeps working at it. " He is a little bit upset that the other top players in the game seem almost content and happy to be where they are. With all the money you win for placing second and third, why work extra hard to beat Tiger. It seems almost as if players don't mind finishing second, an attitude you will never see in the best golfers. "Money definitely has an impact on players, while Tiger works hard, others aren't putting forth the effort because it's as if they're happy (with where they are).</td>
