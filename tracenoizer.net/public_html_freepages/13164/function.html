 . Hodel Duke University Smirnov showed that there is a one-to-one correspondence between totally bounded uniform spaces and proximity spaces; moreover, Hunsaker and Lindgren have extended this result to quasi-uniform and quasi-proximity spaces. We prove cardinal function versions of these two theorems.

 At least for this post here I would like to continue concentrating on a single constraint. As soon as I have straightened out this simplified case for myself we could then move on to more general setups, ok. The physical version of a kinematical observable of type "some function of the metric field at point p in spacetime" should be of type "integral of that function over spacetime", at least as long as one specifies "point p" by partial observables. (Such a model need not be homogeneous and can in fact be quite general. All that is required is that the dimensionally reduced Lagrangian is non-singular.</td>

 Erdoes proved that the set R of all points in Hilbert space with all coordinates rational has dimension 1. It follows immediately from the theorem in dimension theory mentioned above that R can be embedded into Euclidean 3-space. Stallings proved that there exists a compact 0-dimensional subset of the unit square that intersects the graph of every continuous function from the closed unit interval into itself, and he asked if the same kind of set could be found that intersects the graph of every connectivity function (a function is called a connectivity function if for every connected subset of its domain, the graph of the function over the set is a connected set). In 1965 Roberts solved this problem in the affirmative. In 1959-61, Hans Debrunner, a Swiss mathematician and an expert in combinatorial geometry visited Duke for the academic year, having spent the previous year at Princeton with R.</td>
