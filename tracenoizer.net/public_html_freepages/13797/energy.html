Department of Energy (DOE) constructed and operated the site from 1951 to 1991, producing high purity uranium metal in support of national defense programs. This was accomplished by chemically and physically purifying a variety of feed materials, converting uranium compounds into uranium metal, casting the metal into various shapes, and machining the castings to specified dimensions. As a result, the primary contaminants are radionuclides including uranium, thorium, and radium.">
