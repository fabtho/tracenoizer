Yet far too many children, especially those from poor and minority families, are placed at risk by school practices that are based on a sorting paradigm in which some students receive high-expectations instruction while the rest are relegated to lower quality education and lower quality futures. The mission of the Center for Research on the Education of Students Placed At Risk (CRESPAR) is to conduct the research, development, evaluation, and dissemination needed to transform schooling for students placed at risk.

 The Agency will report regularly on the extent to which higher education institutions individually are meeting these expectations and are discharging their responsibilities for the academic standards and quality of their programmes and awards. . It is the first of a suite of inter-related documents which, taken together, will comprise an overall Code of Practice for the Assurance of Academic Quality and Standards in Higher Education for the guidance of higher education institutions subscribing to the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (QAA). The completed Code will identify a series of system-wide expectations covering all matters relating to the management of quality and standards in higher education. The Code will assume that, taking into account nationally agreed principles and practices, each institution has its own systems for independent verification both of their quality and standards and of the effectiveness of their quality assurance systems.</td>
