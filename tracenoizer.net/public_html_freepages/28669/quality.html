 Governing Bodies are taking a more active role in prescribing and monitoring standards of safety and some sporting venues have already been threatened with a loss of international status. From our work with major sporting venues and event organisers, we have found that an independent risk assessment can quickly identify strengths and weaknesses and lead to considerable improvements. Emphasis on People We view risk in a wider context, taking in service quality, business operations and reputation, as well as safety. The effectiveness of a venue's operations is affected by both its physical characteristics and its safety management systems, as is clearly recognised in the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (green guide). The need to consider "people issues" takes on even more importance when managing a major event.</td>

 Because pay-for-skills systems are usually associated with team oriented organizations, the requirements for advancing to higher pay classifications may include more than job proficiency; such as interpersonal skills and contribution to team objectives. The principal advantage of a pay-for-skills system is that it increases the capabilities of employees and provides the organization with increased flexibility in allocating resources. The approach contributes to a higher quality of work experience in that employees gain greater job satisfaction by performing a variety of tasks. A disadvantage of the pay-for-skills system is that an organization must be prepared to provide the necessary training and resources to facilitate the process. Also, this approach to pay may result in higher overall compensation costs as employees usually advance more quickly than under traditional base compensation systems.</td>
