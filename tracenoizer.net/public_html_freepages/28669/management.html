Systems integration has become a critical business issue. Timely and accurate management information - and management of information - equates to competitive advantage. Sharing data across functions is also a business imperative, and yet the legacy of reorganisation, mergers and acquisitions is often disparate computer systems originally developed as standalone solutions on differing hardware and software platforms. Businesses today need practical, working technology solutions to remain competitive, but they don't always have the resources to start from scratch or to achieve their goals alone.</td>
