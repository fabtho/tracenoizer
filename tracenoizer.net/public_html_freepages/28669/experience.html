 . Much of the work that we undertake, therefore, inevitably involves providing solutions for our clients that seamlessly integrate with their established IT systems. Using the latest technologies, and drawing on many years systems integration experience, we can leverage business and legacy applications, messaging and e-commerce systems to deliver highly functional web solutions. For a company intranet, this might involve creating a web interface to an HR system, or on an extranet, making an existing product ordering system available to corporate customers.
