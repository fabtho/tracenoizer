 This Other World of Ours is an art project designed to introduce contemporary British artists to the Russian public. The show will be staged at The Art Media Center TV Gallery in Moscow, an independent enterprise, established in 1991, aimed towards the creation and production of non-commercial cultural projects connected with video and television. A video programme will put these works into context by showing a sample of the wide variety of works currently being produced in the UK. ..</td>

 . Constantly flitting from one burnt out old computer to another, James Wallbank, a core member of the Redundant Technology Initiative (RTI) tells me how the Access Space grew out of everyday RTI activities. In 1997 they sent out a flyer asking UK businesses to donate their old computer equipment for creative and eco-friendly recycling, rather than just dumping them into landfills. Cunningly combining the allures of cultural benefaction and eco-credibility worked wonders on local companies. Wallbank laughs as he recalls how, having given out 200 flyers to friends, donations flooded in and RTI panicked, hastily canceling their plans to send out a further 2000 flyers through the UK Department of Trade and Industry for fear of being buried alive.</td>
