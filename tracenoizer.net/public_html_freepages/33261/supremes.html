 " I guess that sometimes, some people can get a bad rap. Or maybe, sometimes, people really do remember where they came from. The Supremes kept on right on recording Top 10 hits after Diana abandoned the group literally without missing a beat. In 1969 WITH Diana, the group charted 5 singles before "Someday. " since "Love Is Here And Now Your Gone" way back in early 1967, when the group was still The Supremes.</td>

 Her fans will all agree that this album is well worth the wait. Getting a Motown audition through Smokey Robinson, they were signed in 1961, when Berry Gordy asked them to change their name. After a decade and twelve number one hits, the Supremes (as ranked by Billboard magazine's record popularity charts) had become the third biggest pop act of the sixties, trailing only the Beatles and Elvis. It was at this point, in 1970, that Diana Ross decided to strike out on her own. Still signed to Motown, Diana's first solo hit of the album Diana Ross, was "Ain't No Mountain High Enough".</td>
