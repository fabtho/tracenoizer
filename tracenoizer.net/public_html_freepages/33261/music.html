 iMusic Urban Showcase - Diana Ross on the ARTISTdirect Network document. Comprised of 11 unforgettable songs celebrating life and love, including the soaring first single "Someone That You Loved Before", the sultry groove of "Not Over You Yet" and the inspirational dance anthem "Carry On", the album showcases Diana's signature vocal talent. The album also features exclusive music from the powerful ABC TV movie, Double Platinum, such as the Diane Warren penned duet with Brandy, "Love Is All That Matters". In a remarkable career that spans over 30 years, Diana's absence from the music scene only made her fans' hearts and ears grow fonder and after one listen they will be reminded that this diva's style is unmatchable. Her fans will all agree that this album is well worth the wait.</td>

 In 1969 WITH Diana, the group charted 5 singles before "Someday. " since "Love Is Here And Now Your Gone" way back in early 1967, when the group was still The Supremes. And it took the unstoppable star power of Marvin Gaye as a duet partner to again rescue her dormant music career during the period between "Touch Me In The Morning" and "Mahogany". To be fair, Diana's music career fell off so dramatically while the Supremes kept churning out hits because Diana was more seriously focused on becoming a multimedia superstar. It was only after the Supremes became victimized by a constant turnover of singers (Cindy Birdsong left in 1972, and both Jean Terrell and Lynda Lawrence left in 1973) that their star diminished.</td>
