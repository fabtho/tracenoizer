 Use of software to deliver tasks not possible in standard teaching e. automatic marking and feedback, automatic calculations on laboratory data, automatic record keeping, animated sequencing and intellectual interactivity. Also, research is undertaken into the uptake and use of such programs by students, and their attitudes towards such in comparison to standard teaching.
