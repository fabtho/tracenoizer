 " Bugs are little in life, bigger in movies like Them. Midway in stature between actual bugs and movie megabugs is the Volkswagen Beetle. The bug manufactured by Volkswagen experienced breakthrough sales in the United States in the early 1960s in large part because of its reliability, its lack of design flaws or mechanical defects -- its lack of bugs, in other words. (Another important reason was the Doyle Dane Bernbach agency's classic series of understated ads with the headline "Think Small. ") The bugs that plague mechanical, electrical, and electronic systems are often tiny or invisible -- like the microbial bugs that make you feel queasy or worse.</td>
