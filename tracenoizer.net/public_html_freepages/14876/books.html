 I think the AP ended up being too embarrassed to run it. They also ask me what my cat's name is because I try to sneak my cat into every book. So now there isn't enough room for all the books being published. Booksellers have become a smaller and smaller market as monopolies have pushed smaller bookstores out of business. There is less shelf space for the books and these monopolies are only interested in sure bets, so there's less of an investment in new talent.</td>

 Now 29, Sarah graduated from Anglia Poly in 1996 then moved on to do an MA in Brighton before returning here to work freelance. The difficult thing has been getting myself to the standard I considered good enough to progress. During my MA I had written and illustrated four books (Little Fella) for my portfolio so I had some ready-made material to give to publishers. Orchard really liked the character Little Fella and commissioned two books, which is quite unusual. Research is very important, finding the right publishers who will be interested in your type of work.</td>
