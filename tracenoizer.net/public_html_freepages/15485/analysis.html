 You should try us because perhaps you have not been completely satisfied with the quality of the results you have received from other TEM service labs. We are also expert at preparing and examining temperature sensitive materials, exotic materials or materials that other labs find it difficult to prepare. Why shouldn't I use one analysis firm that does several techniques like SIMS, Auger, TEM, etc. Because TEM is our only business, our quality is superb, so you get the results you need the first time. .</td>

 It is engaged in research and graduate instruction in the techniques of satellite oceanography and their application to problems in physical, biological and chemical oceanography. There is a strong link to the Atmospheric and Ocean Optics Group in the Physics Department. Current efforts range from analysis of satellite observations to theoretical radiative transfer modeling of the earth-atmosphere system. There are over a dozen additional projects outside these programs. TOGA efforts focus on development of improved tropical SST fields based on satellite infrared observations.</td>
