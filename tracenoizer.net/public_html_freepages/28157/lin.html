We also received the following information from Mr. Che about his sifu, who's office is located next to the Song Shan mountain temple, since no Shao lin monks are allowed to teach students in the Song shan temple itself any longer for a couple of decades, according to China's government's rules. Then He lived outside of the temple, as a Shao lin layman monk. Shao lin layman monks compare with the temple monks (who still live in the temple) the only different thing is that they can eat meat or drink beer, and other foods and beverages, but the rest about them is the same.">
