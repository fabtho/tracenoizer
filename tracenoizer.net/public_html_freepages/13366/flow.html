 . Modules of code are written, but are only activated if data is sent to them. A set of operations partially ordered by flow dependencies. Any input or output edge can handle multiple pieces of data. Overall, Data Flow can be a very powerful method of parallel programming; however it is very difficult to write programs in a Data Flow environment.</td>

 PDF) The available static analysers of run-time errors cannot find the most part of real errors and are able to generate only long lists of warnings. In this paper, we determine the conditions of a definite error and propose the list of program analyses imposed by these conditions. The static error analyser Wasp based on effective algorithm of powerful context-sensitive data flow analysis with the approximation of definite use-def relations is developed. Data Flow Analysis of Java Programs in the Presence of Exceptions. PDF) For data flow analysis of Java program to be correct and precise, the flows induced by exceptions must be properly analysed.</td>
