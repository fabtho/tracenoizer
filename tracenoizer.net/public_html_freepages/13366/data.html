 As a result, very few machines have been developed for Data Flow and the chances are that very few will be developed for commercial use in the future since Data Flow is expensive and does not have a RAD (Rapid Application Development) programming environment. . Modules of code are written, but are only activated if data is sent to them. A set of operations partially ordered by flow dependencies. Any input or output edge can handle multiple pieces of data.</td>

 com Access 97 Access 2000 Other Products from Peter's Software Comments. . Data Flow Manager (DFM) is a tool to easily transform and move data from one data format to another. DFM can run stand-alone, as an Access database that manages the flow of data from one application format to another, or as an add-in to any Access database application. Almost every MS Access based desktop application that you develop has a requirement to communicate with other systems, big and small.</td>
