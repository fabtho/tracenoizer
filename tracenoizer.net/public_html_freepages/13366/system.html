 KozarSpring 1997 THE TECHNIQUE OF DATA FLOW DIAGRAMMING This section describes in detail the data flow diagramming technique. It is intended to serve as a handbook to guide the reader in developing data flow diagramming skills. The goal of data flow diagramming is to have a commonly understood model of a system. The diagrams are the basis of structured systems analysis. having to start documentation from scratch when the physical system changes since the logical system, WHAT gets done, often remains the same when technology changes.</td>

 When you need a tool to save time and to help communicate ideas, it is a real pleasure to find the right one. " Brad Henry - Software Engineer How to Draw Data Flow Diagrams (DFD) What are Data Flow Diagrams. Data flow diagrams illustrate how data is processed by a system in terms of inputs and outputs. Process Notations Yourdon and CoadProcess Notations Gane and SarsonProcess Notation Process A process transforms incoming data flow into outgoing data flow. Datastore Notations Yourdon and CoadDatastore Notation Gane and SarsonDatastore Notations DataStore Datastores are repositories of data in the system.</td>
