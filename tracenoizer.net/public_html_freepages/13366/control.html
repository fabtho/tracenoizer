 Data Flow Analysis of Java Programs in the Presence of Exceptions. PDF) For data flow analysis of Java program to be correct and precise, the flows induced by exceptions must be properly analysed. In our data flow analysis, the implicit control flow for a raised exception is represented explicitly. Exception branches, exception plateaus, and exception exits for methods and method calls are introduced as additional control flow structures for analysis of exception handling. These structures are constructed dynamically under control of data flow analysis.</td>

 The user will be assisted in these phases by an Instrument Scientist and by observation preparation tools. These tools include generic systems like finding chart generators or guide star selection systems, and instrument related tools like exposure time calculators (ETCs). Feasibility checks of the proposals are performed by the observatory and include technical feasibility and exposure time control. Observation Handling During Phase 2 of the proposal preparation process, successful programs convert their observing programs into structures which are schedulable and executable by the VLT. These files are called Observation Blocks (OBs) and combine together target and instrument data for one or more exposures on typically a single astronomical object.</td>
