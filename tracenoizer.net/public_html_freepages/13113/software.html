 However, doing so is also expected to yield new insights into ways to facilitate in other kinds of end-user programming environments and ultimately, could even impact interactive visual programming languages and environments used by professional programmers. . End-User Software Engineering End-User Software Engineering Overview The objective of this project is to improve the reliability of software produced by end-user programming languages in general, and by spreadsheet languages in particular. Our approach is to address software engineering issues as an integrated whole in ways that incrementally interact with each other and with the user. For example, the system will notice the user's reactions to sample values she tests, and will then suggest general principles about the spreadsheet, encouraging the user to refine or modify the suggestions.</td>

 . Existing Stats system users have already played a crucial role in the development of the AIMS system. A number of Stats users are also providing further assistance by being members of the User Validation Panel for the AIMS software. The AIMS core module will be made available free of charge to all Stats users who are still subscribers at the time of launch. However, because the two systems are almost 10 years apart in database technology we do not intend to offer an upgrade facility from Stats to AIMS.</td>
