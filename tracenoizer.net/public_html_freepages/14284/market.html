I don't mean to take all the credit for the take-up of the Internet and electronic commerce in Europe especially since our conviction is that the development of the information society must, and can only be market-led. Yet it is clear that the liberalisation of telecommunications in the Union has created the right conditions for the expansion of the Internet and electronic commerce. Cryptographic technologies are at the heart of information security.</td>

 This action may serve to reactivate discussions on this issue. Furthermore, as regards intra-Community transfers of these goods, work on trying to find appropriate technical solutions continues and some progress has been made. Despite the difficulties in moving forward on some of these issues as rapidly as we had hoped, I would like to stress that the analysis, advocating a need for restructuring the European defence industry and for creating a single market for defence products, is still valid. The competitiveness of the European defence industry is vital to the credibility of the nascent European Security and Defence Policy. Thus, the Commission expects that governments may recognise increasingly the urgency for a change in attitudes in order to end policies and practices that prevent European defence companies from working together more efficiently.</td>
