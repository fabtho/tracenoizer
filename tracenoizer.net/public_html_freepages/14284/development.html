 We look forward to an important discussion on Europe's Broadband Future tonight, introduced by three distinguished speakers. Before we return to this theme, however, I trust you will permit me a few opening remarks as Chair of the Board of Governors of the European Internet Foundation. We have had a most constructive exchange of views on the future development of the Foundation, for which I am most grateful, and which will help us strengthen the organisation over the next 12 months. The General Assembly also elected our Board of Management for the coming term, which will extend to the end of the mandate of this Parliament. Arlene takes up the seat vacated when Mo O'Toole stepped aside to concentrate on her committee duties.</td>
