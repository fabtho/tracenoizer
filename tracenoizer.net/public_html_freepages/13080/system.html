 It's fun, and a great alternative to other options which seem to be the cause of much swearing and hair-pulling. If you own a Mac, you understand why most of us who own one are such rabid devotees.

 . 64Mb is about the minimum, but I would recommend at least 128Mb.

By consolidating and integrating the key steps of sample collection, stabilization and purification, the PAXgene Blood RNA System is designed to minimize the chronic problems associated with preanalytical process variability and to eliminate much of the unpredictability that has been a critical limitation in RNA analysis. Due to the significant information content of RNA, this molecule is widely analyzed in clinical research, molecular diagnostics and genomics. Studies have demonstrated that many messenger RNA species are being up-and down regulated or degraded in vitro after blood collection and during sample transportation and processing.</td>
