 There will be a link from here to the full article when it is available on the web. The current understanding of such measurements points to the distinction between intrinsic factors e. In the present work, we employ the Landauer theory which relates the conductance to a scattering problem to study in detail the contact effects on electron transport across a molecular wire sandwiched between two semi-infinite carbon nanotube leads with open ends. This allowes us to obtain the conductance as a function of system parameters such as the coupling strength, the dimensionality and geometry of contacts and electrodes.

2 (See bottom for change history) In this paper I would like to bring the attention to an important performance bottleneck in the ld. so currently does a fine job for the things it was designed. The problem is that it wasn't designed for todays Linux Desktop. Slow is a very subjective term, but when it comes to a graphical user interface, things are typically perceived as slow when there is a latency of more than 0. So if I click on a button, it should bring up a window on my screen within 0.</td>

 In the former GDR where only two percent of the inhabitants are immigrants and live mostly separated from each other a suitable self-defence is very hard to organize. In fact, the immigrants and non-racist-germans (if there are any) are on the stake to prepare for batteling for their lives. Spreed the view, that armed attacks, aiming to shatter racist germany, are the only solution of the new but also old german-problem. ..</td>
