 A four-time Gold Glove winner, he's a big-time leader behind the dish and is excellent at blocking balls in the dirt. Charles has a quick release and an accurate arm which baserunners have come to respect over the years. A South Florida native, he returned to his original team when he signed with the Marlins after the 2000 season. With such a young and talented pitching staff, the Marlins will certainly benefit from Charles' wisdom and the way he handles a staff. Charles began 2000 with the Baltimore Orioles before being traded to the Chicago White Sox on July 29.</td>
