 There is particular emphasis on applications involving molecular motion and chemical rate processes. In this work analogies between NMR and laser light diffraction are used to aid in the design and interpretation of experiments. These experiments combine high-resolution NMR with imaging technology (MRI) so that NMR spectra of mixtures can be resolved on the basis of molecular sizes and shapes. DOSY is being applied to the aggregation of block copolymers in supercritical fluids, the characterization of derivatized gold nanoparticles, etc. We are interested in the effects of chemical exchange on NMR diffusion spectra.</td>

 Perhaps a Fender Stratocaster, Telecaster, or Jazzmaster is your thing. These and many other fine vintage stringed musical instruments can often be found on this web page. The selection changes frequently, and cool instruments arrive on a regular basis. The following is a list of instruments that I have purchased or traded for over the last year or so. I do a lot of trading, and will consider just about any quality stringed instrument on trade (no pianos.</td>
