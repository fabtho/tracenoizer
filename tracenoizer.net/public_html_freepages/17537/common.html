We get a lot of artwork files that are only 72 dpi (common for web graphics because it saves web space and it looks fine on a computer monitor screen), however these same files print very badly. 72 dpi artwork printed looks like Atari 2600 from the earlier 1980's - like those pixeled Space Invader graphics.

 The information provided by the Initial Search is as stated above. Within these reports, the depth of detail contained for each individual is naturally dependent on what the research discovers, but the software is sufficiently flexible to record and report on practically any information that is found. Identifying a person with an uncommon name in a small parish is much easier and less time-consuming than identifying a person with a common name in a large city). Once we get beyond the period of Statutory Civil Registration i. pre 1855 and are dependent on the Non-Statutory Records, the success or otherwise of the search and the time involved in acquiring information is very much dependent on the quality and comprehensiveness of the records for that part of the country at which we are looking.</td>

 I am a single mother who also feels that the time has come to prepare ourselves for war. I'm trying not to freak out, but I really feel that time is running out on us. I know that God will supply my needs and give me a means of escape; but He also gave me common sense so that I could prepare in these perilous times. Should I just send you payment for the book upon receipt. Sincerely, Joni Joni, Thank you for sharing your story with me.</td>

 The most probably is just that I haven't gotten to it yet. If it was sent more than a month ago and it's not up yet, then it could be for one of several other reasons. The most common is that I wasn't able to get the file. For some reason, I rarely ever get successful attachments from people on AOL. This is a problem with their mailing system and if you try to re-send it I should get it.</td>
