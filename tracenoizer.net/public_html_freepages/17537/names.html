 Most people are curious about their forefathers - who they were, where they lived, what they did for a living, or even whether the family cupboard contains a skeleton. An investigation into Scottish records of the past may be difficult or even impossible for those living at a distance from Edinburgh (although some records are held locally, the main record depositories for the whole of Scotland are held in Edinburgh). Birth Certificates contain District Name and Number; Entry Number; Date, Place and Time of Birth; All given Names of Child; Names of Parents and Occupation of Father; Date and Place of Parents' Marriage; Informant's Name; Usual Address if different from Place of Birth; Date of Registration and Name of Registrar. Death Certificates contain District Name and Number; Date, Time, Place and Cause of Death; Name of Doctor who certified Death; Name of Informant; Occupation of Deceased; Names of Parents, whether or not they are Deceased and Occupation of Father; Sometimes Name of Spouse but always Age and Marital Status; Date of Registration and Name of Registrar. Census Returns Cenuses have been taken every 10 years since 1841 and consist of a survey of every household.</td>

 They sat thus night after night recalling that fatal Friday, till every detail of it was stamped on their brains and came through on the other side like the faces on a bad coinage. Darling would cry, and Nana's bark was the echo of it, but Mrs. Darling never upbraided Peter; there was something in the right-hand corner of her mouth that wanted her not to call Peter names. They would sit there in the empty nursery, recalling fondly every smallest detail of that dreadful evening. It had begun so uneventfully, so precisely like a hundred other evenings, with Nana putting on the water for Michael's bath and carrying him to it on her back.</td>
