 com Without Prejudice and with specific reservation of my rights. . At our website you will find a great many resources not available anywhere else that will facilitate your study of the word of God in relation to the day in which we live and the days ahead as we anticipate the establishment of the literal kingdom of God on earth. You will find chiasms and parallels, which are poetic forms found in the text of scripture which are basically scripture commentary on scripture. For example, one of my favorites is the parallel between the first half of Isaiah 66 and II Thessalonians 2.</td>

 a long chain of vortex rings, or three rings, would give each very characteristic reactions upon other such kinetic atoms. " Kelvin's "vortex atom" theory of matter--that all matter could consist of tiny linked and knotted vortices--was the driving force behind his hydrodynamic research, as he says in his 1867 paper. If we remember that the concept of an ideal fluid permeating all space was a valid one at that point, and consider Kelvin's theory was 40 years ahead of Bohr, it is a remarkable theory. Unfortunately for Kelvin--who believed smoke rings collapse through viscous effects or turbulence, and ideal vortex-rings could exist forever--his theory was disproved. In 1977, Sheila Widnall and Charles Tsai did a more careful analysis of vortex- ring stability that showed they are inherently unstable.</td>
