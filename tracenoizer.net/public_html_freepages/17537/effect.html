<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" If heat of reaction is greater than heat of activation, you have an explosive mixture--this is how a bomb detonator operates. Just getting a small portion of the chemical to burn is enough because this portion generates enough heat to set off a bigger portion, which sets off an even bigger portion and so on until it blows up. Cold explosive will need greater initial input to raise the temperature above the critical point but after this, there would be no significant effect. Once the reaction begins, it releases heat and quickly makes the immediate area very hot. This heat cannot be transferred to the cold mass of the explosive because there isn't time, so the explosion progresses through the the explosive.">

 Please use the APPLICATION FORM for this purpose if you decide to go ahead. If necessary, please convert to the appropriate value in your local currency. This, subject to the time available, has the effect of establishing the Trunk of the Family Tree back towards The Early 1800's (although compulsory Registration didn't commence until 1855 it will provide the Death Certificates of those who died post 1854 which contain the details as previously described). The results of this would be presented to you in the form of a typed Narrative Report together with computer printed Ancestor and Descendant trees. On receipt of the above results, it will be up to you whether or not you wish to proceed with further in depth research at the above hourly rate.</td>

 The Stoics affirm, whom Cicero ridicules in this matter (as Cicero so well could), that there is no word whose origin cannot be explained with certainty. For you see that these words make a sound such as the very things which are signified by them. But since there are things which do not make sounds, it is the effect which forms the similarity, e. whether they impinge harshly or softly on the senses, the harshness or softness of the sound as it affects our hearing gives them names. So that the sense of the words (the feel of the words) and the things themselves have the same effect.</td>
