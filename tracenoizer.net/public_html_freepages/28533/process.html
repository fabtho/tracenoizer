Last spring, the NRC proposed a 15-year study focusing on four questions central to school reform. Among them, "How can student engagement in the learning process and motivation to learn be increased. " The existing research on student motivation lacks both an agreed-on set of principles and an understanding of how to apply them systematically to the everyday lives of teachers and students, the NRC reports. Meanwhile, the agency points to national surveys revealing widespread disengagement with schooling.</td>
