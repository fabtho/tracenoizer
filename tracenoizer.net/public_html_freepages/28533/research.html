 Peter has been my supervisor for about 2 years and I have been encouraged by him to examine interpretive methods that I would not have considered without his guidance. . I'm in the process of asking the PhD and ScEdD students with whom I work for their thesis titles, a photo and a brief abstract of the research work they're doing, and adding that information to this page. Some of them also have their own home pages, which will tell you more about their work and research interests. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate and evaluate the effectiveness of a range of pedagogical strategies designed to enable science teachers to incorporate bioethics education into their secondary science curriculum.</td>
