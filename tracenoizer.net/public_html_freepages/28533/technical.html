 " - Mark Williams Mark graduated with a PhD in science education in October 1997. Part 1 comprises an action research study conducted by the researcher into his own university teaching, an undergraduate business computing course. The goal of the teaching reform was to enrich the narrowly technical aspects of the course by engaging students in open discourse about the meaning, purpose and wider societal implications of business computing. Part 2 comprises a critical reflexive account in which the researcher explores his own ethical conduct when implementing the teaching reform. The research methodologically draws on reflexive phenomenology and heuristic inquiry, and includes a Jungian analysis of the researcher's dreams as they pertain to his research and teaching.</td>
