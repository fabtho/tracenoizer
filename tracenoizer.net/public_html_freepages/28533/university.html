 Undergraduate Research Program - Homepage Search for Welcome The Undergraduate Research Program (URP) facilitates research experiences for undergraduates with UW faculty members across the disciplines. URP maintains a listing of current UW research opportunities and related national programs. The Annual UW Undergraduate Research Symposium provides a forum for students to present their work to the university community and the public. We invite faculty members to post their student research opportunites on this web site, and to use our Faculty Resources section for information on incorporating undergraduates into research and scholarship, and for local and national funding sources. URP staff are available for consultation with students and faculty during drop-in hours or by appointment.</td>
