 The findings of this study have ramifications for all teachers who wish to enable their students to become informed decision makers in the future. Of particular interest to David has been the apparent paucity of academic achievement by many indigenous students as they study science through Western style schools and curricula. This paucity appears to result in what he has termed 'educational alienation', which is evidenced by poor grades and slow rates of progression through the curriculum, and by students displaying a high degree of antagonism toward the education system. David has sought to understand the causes of educational alienation by means of a Grounded Theory project, using an Integrative Research Review as the primary means of data collection. The outcomes of the Grounded Research caused him to re-think his understanding of culture and tacit acceptance of conceptual change theory.</td>
