 Well, I've been waiting for the thread like this for 4 years now. I have been using Linux on my desktop machine since v0. 97, and now we have a Cadence license (really cheap since we are a university lab) to perform all standard tasks (well, it took us probably a year and half to customize Cadence for our technology. Cadence runs on HP machines (HP also offers nice educational discounts). If you are connected to the network, you need to install all the latest security patches, when you get a nice large monitor it might not be supported by the proprietory X server and you need to get a newer one somewhere (helped one EE guy to do that on his Solaris).</td>
