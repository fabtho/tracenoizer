 Two-way programs typically share the goals of bilingual proficiency, academic achievement, and positive cross-cultural attitudes and behaviors, but they vary a good deal in the approaches and strategies they use to work toward those goals. A host of local factors affect such issues as student enrollment, program features and design, and instructional features. Emerging results of studies of two-way bilingual programs point to their effectiveness in educating nonnative-English-speaking students, their promise of expanding our nation's language resources by conserving the native language skills of minority students and developing second language skills in English-speaking students, and their hope of improving relationships between majority and minority groups by enhancing cross-cultural understanding and appreciation. INTRODUCTION The best setting for educating linguistic minority pupils--and one of the best for educating any pupil--is a school in which two languages are used without apology and where becoming proficient in both is considered a significant intellectual and cultural achievement. Glenn, Principal, 1990 In a growing number of schools in the United States, students are learning through two languages in programs that aim to develop dual language proficiency along with academic achievement.</td>

 GNI per capita is therefore the Bank's main criterion of classifying countries. The process of setting per capita income thresholds started with finding a stable relationship between a summary measure of wellbeing such as poverty incidence and infant mortality on the one hand and economic variables including per capita GNI estimated based on the Bank's Atlas method on the other. Based on such a relationship and the annual availability of Bank's resources, the original per capita income thresholds were established. Thereafter, the original thresholds have been updated every year to incorporate the effect of international inflation, which is now measured by the average inflation of the G-5 countries ("SDR deflator"). Thus, the thresholds remain constant in real terms over time.</td>
