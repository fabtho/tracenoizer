 Our initial phase, from 1994 to 1995, focused on machine-printed documents. The second phase, from 1997 to 1999, focused on handwritten documents. In the future , we hope to address script separation for multi-script document images, and writer identificiation for handwritten document images. Templates were developed by clustering textual symbols from a training set. Symbols from new document images were compared to the templates to find the best script.</td>
