<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" According to Chuck, this trend created a dilemma for the breed, as most Yorkshires did not have enough structure to handle extreme muscle. Not only did the Winter Type Conference help to promote Olsen Yorkshires as performance-type hogs, but Chuck also exhibited the champion tested boar at the Summer Type Conference and was awarded the Hog College Boar at the National Barrow Show. Today, Chuck believes that the Yorkshire breed is on a course with two distinctly different paths, the show pig business and the commercial industry. Approaching the Yorkshire business as true livestock breeders, the Olsen family has chosen to focus their efforts on a unique niche within the breeding stock industry. As he reflects over the past several decades of breeding Yorkshire hogs, Chuck confesses that the trends have definitely driven the industry.">
