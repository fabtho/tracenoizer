 Most of the paid staff are being groomed to go out and start new churches within six years. . Woodland United Methodist Church in MN used Morris' book and other materials to learn the discernment-consensus building model a couple of years ago. Arvada Presbyterian in Arvada Colorado is working toward consensus building and discernment. They have been using discernment models from Chuck Olsen book Transforming Church Boards and more recently Discerning the Will of God by Chuck and Danny Morris.</td>

 A little shy, she was hesitant to speak up in the midst of heated discussions. She wondered what the answers would've been, and how they might have affected her vote. Larry had been full of enthusiasm when asked to serve in a position of leadership on the church board. The church was very important to him, having nurtured and challenged his faith. He believed this opportunity to serve was a way to further live out that faith.</td>

 When, in God's kingdom, adults and children are equally welcome, the traditional distinction between those who are of age and those who are not of age can no longer be the final word. In the light of God's kingdom relations between adults and children will therefore also change in the present. Do children feel welcomed and affirmed in our church community. In what ways are we including children in worship activities, decision-making, and service to the church and community. Do children have opportunities for active leadership in our worship services.</td>
