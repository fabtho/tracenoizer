 Bodyguards have been around since early recorded history, and becoming a bodyguard continues to be a very interesting and exciting decision for men and women of all ages. Being a bodyguard is more than just standing in front of a door and grunting or shoving people out of the way of the person being protected. The difference between being a bodyguard with little or no training, and becoming a personal protection professional is all in the training. There is a great deal to learn about the difference between being a bodyguard that has limited performance ability, and a protective specialist who has taken the time to learn what protecting someone up close, personally and totally, is really about. Personal protection specialists are focused on the total safety and security of the person they are protecting, and are competent to act in any emergency.</td>
