 . Our focus is timing analysis and timing convergence. Our mission is to give designers the best electronic design automation (EDA) tools possible for their tight timing requirements. Our goal is to offer a complete physically validated synthesis solution. By combining our timing analysis, synthesis, and layout technology expertise, Incentia bridges the gap between the logic synthesis and physical layout processes.</td>
