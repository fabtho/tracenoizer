 During that period, IIASA's web rose to one of the most visited scientific sites in Europe. Interactive CD-ROMs were introduced for dissemination of research results. Important new scientific activities were established, such as Social Security Reform, Natural Catastrophes and Developing Countries, and Transitions to New Technologies. In addition to his role as Director, he was an active scientist, publishing e. Ice Ages and Astronomical Causes -- Data, Spectral Analysis and Mechanisms (with Richard A.</td>

 . Software Process Overview Software Process Overview Process research in SERL encompasses both the empirical analysis of processes, and investigation of system infrastructure for process automation. Our empirical analysis research has been investigating and developing methods for using collected process event data to better understand and analyze a process. System infrastructure research has looked at methods for bridging disparate process systems, and applied virtual environments to process automation. .</td>

 Each subsection also describes a validation suite for the implementation of the primitive. . Detection Confidence and Statistical Analysis The Detection Confidence and Statistical Analysis development group is charged with Developing of statistical analyses to assess confidence and uncertainties in detection and parameter estimation This includes statistical tests involving single detectors, multiple gravitational wave detectors acting in concert or in coincidence, and gravitational wave detectors acting in coincidence with other (e.
