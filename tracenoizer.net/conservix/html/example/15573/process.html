 System infrastructure research has looked at methods for bridging disparate process systems, and applied virtual environments to process automation. . Software Process Overview Software Process Overview Process research in SERL encompasses both the empirical analysis of processes, and investigation of system infrastructure for process automation. Our empirical analysis research has been investigating and developing methods for using collected process event data to better understand and analyze a process. System infrastructure research has looked at methods for bridging disparate process systems, and applied virtual environments to process automation.</td>

 Roberts Return to the Department of Chemical Engineering Home Page. .Process Research Center's Home Page Background and Scope The Process Research Center at the University of Akron was established in the Department of Chemical Engineering, College of Engineering, on June 1, 1990. The initial funding for the Center was provided by Ohio Board of Regents Research Challenge and Academic Challenge grants. The Center provides a complete list of process engineering services, including process and equipment design.</td>

 This work also provides a platform for research on how to perform rigorous evaluation, comparison, analysis, evolution and improvement of software development processes themselves. The early focus of this work is on comparison and analysis of software design methodologies. In LASER, we are developing process programming technology in the context of a distributed process-centered environment. A process centered environment interprets process programs, using them to coordinate the efforts of people, computers, and software tools. It also provides a platform for the evaluation, comparison, analysis, evolution and improvement of software development processes and their support.</td>
