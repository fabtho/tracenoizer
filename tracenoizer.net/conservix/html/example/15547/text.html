 People talk about going digital and wanting bits instead of atoms. In this series of articles, I am writing about the state of the digital lifestyle. Before talking about text, it is important to define what I mean by digital. A simple definition might say that being digital uses a binary system that involves ones and zeroes. Digital video, for example, has the images written to a binary-based file.</td>

 The research so far has shown that it is possible to adapt many of the fundamental concepts developed to date in computational linguistics in such a way that they become useful for text-picture combinations as well. . Whereas humans easily become experts for mapping from images to text (e. , a radio reporter describing a soccer game) or from text to images (e. , a cartoonist transforming a story into a comic strip), such complex transformations are a great challenge for computer systems.</td>
