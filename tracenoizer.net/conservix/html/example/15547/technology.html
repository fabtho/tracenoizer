 Overview Sensors Image Processing Software Copyright 2002 Canesta, Inc. . Image Processing Software Image Processing Software The second component of Canesta's electronic perception technology is a robust body of new, "industrial grade" software designed for real-world applications. Since Canesta's software starts with a three-dimensional view of the world, provided "for free" by the hardware, it has a substantial advantage over classical image processing software that struggles to construct three-dimensional representations using complex mathematics, and using images from multiple cameras or points of view. This significant reduction in complexity makes it possible to embed the application-independent portion of the processing software directly into the chips themselves so they may be used in the most modestly-priced, and even pocket-sized, electronic devices.</td>
