Cognitive Science Academic Programs List Cognitive Science Schools, Departments, and Institutes This is a list of some of the schools, departments and institutes in the US offering multidisciplinary programs in Cognitive Science and closely related fields. Some schools have a separate department which accepts students on its own; others have some type of cognitive science program in which students are admitted through a participating "home" department. Most of the included schools offer a separate or joint degree in Cognitive Science.</td>
