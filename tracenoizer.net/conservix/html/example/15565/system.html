 This description is in keeping with the appropriate medical terminology. . The system determines information about the spatial relationship of objects in (two-dimensional) imagery and conveys it in the form of an English sentence. In the first task, the goal of landmark description is to find the "best" natural language path description for getting from a start landmark in an image to a goal location. The goodness of a description is quantified in terms of a measure of ambiguity of the spatial relationship of an object pair given its context, and given other considerations such as image resolution.</td>

Information about new sites and extra information about already evaluated sites might be obtained from a variety of sources.</td>
