 Rather than simply film the filmmaking process and create a mise-en-abime a la Vertov (as powerful as this technique in The Man with the Movie Camera is), Farocki films many proliferating technologies and interrogates historical stages of their development; he charts the relation of the human body to these machines, which are seen as extensions of senses and organs. This model forms a kind of counter-model to the splurge of images, new and always the same, of the media-at-large. Surfeit, superabundance on the one hand, a longer meditation on isolated images such as produced in Vietnam (in the image industry coming out of that war), on the other. her pamphlet "handed out at Fehrberliner Platz" as counter-information. The same image put to two radically different uses, and yet within the same curtailing process of the image by language, by the caption.</td>
