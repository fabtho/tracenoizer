Most of these locations originated as African-American settlements, some as early as the 18th century. My work uses historical and documentary text combined with images that seek to describe the experience in black communities within this region. The stories of these communities in the southern part of the state are remarkable and generally underrepresented in literature and documentary images. .">

 Only a deeper understanding of the context of their making and of the lives and conditions of the victims moves us beyond the limitations of the photographic medium. . But, as with all collections of documentary photographs, there is much more to be known than what is contained in the frame. The incarcerated and tortured, captive and fearful, look out. They often stare into the lens, but really, we must acknowledge, into our lives.</td>
