 . Ranging from Willem de Kooning to Andy Warhol to Sue Coe, this provocative anthology chronicles the distinctive voice of a formidable art critic whose reflections on art, artists, and art criticism constitute an eclectic exploration of the ways in which art and art criticism have influenced contemporary thought and psychology. The book's investigation into the social impact of artwork also reflects on the inner life of the artist.
