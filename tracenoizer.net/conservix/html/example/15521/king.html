 It is highly unlikely that the two had any connection with each other. .Arthur, it seems, is claimed as the King of nearly every Celtic Kingdom known. The 6th century certainly saw many men named Arthur born into the Celtic Royal families of Britain but, despite attempts to identify the great man himself amongst them, there can be little doubt that most of these people were only named in his honour. Breton King Geoffrey of Monmouth recorded Arthur as a High-King of Britain.</td>

 . Now it so happened that on one occasion the princess's golden ball did not fall into the little hand which she was holding up for it, but on to the ground beyond, and rolled straight into the water. The king's daughter followed it with her eyes, but it vanished, and the well was deep, so deep that the bottom could not be seen. At this she began to cry, and cried louder and louder, and could not be comforted. All he does is to sit in the water with the other frogs, and croak.</td>

 Abdullah, 37, certainly resembles his father physically and is reputed to be of a similar character. But he is wholly untested in the diplomatic and political minefield through which his father guided the kingdom for the last five decades. Abdullah was only named King Hussein's heir in January 1999. He replaced his uncle, Prince Hassan, as crown prince, after Hassan was deposed over a disagreement about the succession. It now seems clear the king wanted to use his last days to ensure the accession of his own bloodline rather than his brother's.</td>
