PFU followed up the browsing system by announcing and releasing the Kokuho Butsuzo series CD-ROM titles last May, which has been well-received for its high quality. We have received many requests to produce an English edition, which would be an excellent souvenir from Japan, could satisfy the curiosity of English speakers interested in the Japanese culture, and serve as good reference material in libraries and schools. In response, we are releasing the English edition the Buddhist Images CD-ROM. This popular guide to traditional Japanese culture, inherited and cherished with pride, is now available in English.</td>
