 . The nature of performance in the computer age includes these elements of time and stage as space. Baudrillard might describe performing and the performer as more real than real, so real that they are virtual. Anything involving action, interaction, time, and space is performance. Therefore, performing is both real and virtual, becoming more real than real through the very nature of simulation.</td>
