<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" "Past research has demonstrated that increasing urban vegetation and coating roofs with paint or roofing material that is highly reflective to sunlight can reduce the temperature of the urban heat island," says Taha. "We think that these methods can also reduce the formation of photochemical smog. " The heat island effect is an elevation of temperature of urban areas relative to the surrounding countryside caused by the removal of vegetation, and the use of materials such as asphalt that absorb the sun's heat. The temperature elevation in Los Angeles can be five to ten degrees (Fahrenheit) on hot summer days. Berkeley Lab researchers have shown that re-roofing with "high-albedo" (solar-reflective) materials, and planting vegetation can reduce the magnitude of the heat island effect, and as a result, air conditioning bills and energy use.">

 . Here's an example Peltier unit about to be attached to a CPU. The Peltier Effect was discovered in 1834 by a French watchmaker and physicist by the name of Jean Charles Athanase Peltier. To put it more specifically, the electrons moving from the material with the electron deficit (the P-type material) to the material with the electron surplus (the N-type material) will absorb energy at the connector, while the electrons moving from N-type to P-type will release energy at the connector. It's worth noting that the abstract unit depicted above is both simplified and not quite complete in its description of an actual retail Peltier device.</td>
