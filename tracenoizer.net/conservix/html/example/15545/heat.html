Computer Assisted Tutorial on Cell Stress (Heat Shock) Genes and Proteins Computer Assisted Tutorial on Cell Stress (Heat Shock) Genes and Proteins Dear Student, I would like your help in an experiment to change the nature of a 3rd year science tutorial on the stress response. You will need to be patient and expect glitches because this is the first time we have done this. What we are going to do is to try a nd use computers and the Internet to learn more about cell stress.</td>
