Now you can benefit from the numerous advantages of self-contained systems without pumping sea water throughout your vessel. With a flooded system you eliminate the head pressure from distances ADWL - only frictional losses need to be considered, which is ideal for multi-level applications and installations well above the water line, such as large ships and oil rigs. You can eliminate the heat exchanger and raw water pump depicted below by using a keel cooler - our staff will assist you in deciding what system best suits your needs.">
