 . Although the language of its people was largely Romance-derived, Transylvania was historically part of Hungary. 1415 - 1438 Lorand Lepes Prince of Transylvania, under Hungarian suzerainty. 1441 - 1456 Lancu of Hunedoara Prince of Transylvania, under Hungarian suzerainty. Transylvania is then largely ruled through appointed princes in the same style as neighbouring Wallachia and Moldavia.</td>

 The Transylvanian Society of Dracula has long been aware of the frantic search of the meaning of the vampire on the part of the western researchers whose folkloric roots were cut by industrialization and post-industrialization, by Cartesian upbringing. . To that purpose they plan to dig up the remains of Prince Vlad Dracula, the Impaler (XV century) at the monastery of Snagov. This mistake alone brings doubts on the wisdom of resurrecting a man who would regard this confusion as an insult to his intelligence and punish the ignorants. The sad thing about Prince Vlad Dracula is that no one knows where he was buried.</td>

 BERNARD ADAMS studied at Pembroke College, Cambridge. He was a Fellow of the School of Oriental and African Studies, London, and specializes in the translation of Hungarian literature. Forced to flee his beloved Transylvania, the Prince and his entourage spent some years in France, and were then invited to Turkey by Sultan Ahmed III, going there in 1717. Some of the party eventually left, but, like Rakoczi, Mikes spent the rest of life in Turkist exile. The memoir had a considerable vogue in Transylvania at the time, and Mikes writes in a well-established tradition.</td>
