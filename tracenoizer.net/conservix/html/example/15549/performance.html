 Rossiter joined the National Institute of Standards and Technology in 1969 as a member of the Organic Chemistry Section. From 1970 until the present, he has been a member of the Building Materials Division of the Building and Fire Research Laboratory. As an organic chemist, his research interests center around the performance and service-life prediction of organic building materials, particularly in the areas of roofing and thermal insulation. In addition, he has participated in projects involving lead paint and the performance of materials in solar collector systems. This study followed a related investigation that examined the reliability of spot test kits for detecting the presence of lead in household paint.</td>
