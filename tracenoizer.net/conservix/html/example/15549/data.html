 The goal of this project is to interest and support young women in Computer Science, 1995. .org), which focuses on realizing the concept of Virtual Data. Virtual Data encompasses the definition and delivery to a large community of a (potentially unlimited) virtual space of data products derived from experimental data. Major development was geared towards efficient and accurate simulation of message-passing programs (such as those using MPI) on high performance systems (such as the IBM SP).</td>

 NewZoid is intended to be a therapeutically subversive reaction to life in the bewilderness of our information society. It is the Internet's most ambitious automatic manipulation and transformation of unpredictable textual material. It has been admitted to the rhizome data base and chosen as a hot site by e-USA TODAY.

 In the United States, a national probability sample was drawn that resulted in over 500 schools and approximately 33,000 students participating in the study. This sample design ensures the appropriate number of schools and students are participating to provide a representative sample of fourth-, eighth-, and twelfth-grade students in the United States as a whole. The TIMSS International Study Center at Boston College diligently worked to ensure that data collection procedures across countries were comparable. Utilizing two independent translations within each country, the TIMSS materials were translated into the national languages of the participating countries. Once these translations were reconciled, the TIMSS International Study Center verified these results through the use of a professional translation agency.</td>
