 From 1970 until the present, he has been a member of the Building Materials Division of the Building and Fire Research Laboratory. As an organic chemist, his research interests center around the performance and service-life prediction of organic building materials, particularly in the areas of roofing and thermal insulation. In addition, he has participated in projects involving lead paint and the performance of materials in solar collector systems. This study followed a related investigation that examined the reliability of spot test kits for detecting the presence of lead in household paint. This research was complementary to past studies on the performance of liquid-adhesive-bonded seams.</td>

 Congressional Review We recently completed evaluations of the FY 1999 performance plans submitted by the 24 cabinet departments and major independent agencies that are subject to the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act. The evaluations were done by staff teams representing those House committees having authorizing, funding, and oversight jurisdiction over each of the 24 agencies. Minority staff were invited to the evaluation sessions, and they participated in many sessions. Senate staff also participated in some evaluation sessions. .</td>

 To ensure that tribal members are fully aware of the opportunities available to them via high-speed Internet access, the HPWREN team is currently helping to establish and continue education programs at each reservation's learning center. Not only are Pala, La Jolla, and Rincon tribal members benefitting from high-speed Internet connectivity, but soon all 18 San Diego County reservations will have a network connection - thanks to the recently awarded Hewlett Packard grant to the Southern California Tribal Chairmen's Association (SCTCA). This summer marked the first signficicant activity for the SCTCA and HP efforts; high school students from tribes throughout the county participated in a Summer Youth Academy. By extending their T-1 Internet connection across Highway 79 via a wireless ethernet bridge, Warner Unified School District now has the ability for all computers to receive broadband Internet connectivity. While the equipment was paid for by the school district, the HPWREN team participated in the installation and also provided technical expertise to guide the students through the deployment process.</td>
