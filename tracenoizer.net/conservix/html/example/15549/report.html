 'Transparency' refers to the PA being clearly reported, so that the audience can gain a good understanding of what has been done, what the results are, and why the results are as they are. This is a more subtle, and audience-dependent, requirement. The difficulty of finding an unambiguous vocabulary for discussion of these issues was also addressed, along with recommendations for the essential elements of a safety assessment report. Completed in 1996, the resulting Lessons Learnt from Ten Performance Assessment Studies is available free online (pdf, 395 kb). These were examined from both the implementer and regulator points of view.</td>
