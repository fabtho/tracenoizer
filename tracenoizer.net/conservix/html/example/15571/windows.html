 There are some other similar programs to Windows Hider Pro, but we can assure you that our program is the best. . You have the options to specify desired hotkeys, windows to be hidden and to have the program started every time Windows starts up. The program works in hidden mode so that a casual observer is unaware of its existence. Pressing the specified Hotkey brings up an options dialog to configure Hotkeys and add new windows to the list of those that require hiding.</td>
