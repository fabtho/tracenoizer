 To place company officers in these positions without proper development, preparation and training is a disservice to them, their subordinates and the citizens they serve. . We brought three newly promoted lieutenants, and the experience for them was very enlightening and will help lay some groundwork for their entire career as a company officer. The entire conference experience (course sessions, travel, socializing, interaction) helped us with some very good team building that will help at home. I feel I can return to my department with a new outlook and possibly infect my co-workers with a positive attitude.</td>
