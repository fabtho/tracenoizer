 We had both previously worked for Control Data and were pioneers in developing engineering approaches to software development, which was a new concept at the time. To the best of my knowledge, though, this was the first use of the term in Silicon Valley. I had also specialized in developing software that would measure computer performance and we thought that there would be a big market for that kind of software product in the rapidly-growing IBM 360 customer base. So the plan was to sell our services as software engineering consultants and get the money together to be able to develop some performance measurement products for the IBM 360 market. Software product companies were a really unknown concept so we had a hard time finding a venture capitalist who would listen to us.</td>
