You can also drag Data Environment objects onto forms or reports to create data-bound controls. Create hierarchies of commands based on a grouping of Command objects, or by relating one or more Command objects together.</td>

 See "Overview of GDE menus" below for detailed descriptions of the menu choices. . BIRCH - GDE GDE - The Genetic Data Environment GDE is best thought of as a program that runs programs. The main GDE window consists of a multiple sequence alignment editor and menu buttons. To perform a task on any sequence or set of sequences, simply click or drag on the sequence(s), and choose a program from one of the menus.</td>
