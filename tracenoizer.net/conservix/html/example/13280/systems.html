 Take a peek at the DARPA-sponsored RT-Mach Effort section above. . We propose mathematical models, and validate them by building real systems (operating systems and services), tools and applications. Real-Time Mach is a real-time operating system developed as a flagship product by the Real-Time and Multimedia Laboratory. Real-Time Mach is a resource kernel which helps to satisfy end-to-end quality-of-service (QoS) requirements.</td>

 Briefings and Documentation Here you will find a number of COE Data Engineering briefings and documentation for online viewing and downloading. . DoD Data Emporium Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) is responsible for data services and other data-related infrastructure that promote interoperability and software reuse in the secure, reliable, and massively networked environment planned for DoD's Global Information Grid (GIG). Reference Data Sets This data product is designed to facilitate the reuse of reference data tables that are highly sharable in DoD systems. Developers are encouraged to use these tables that are in simple ASCII files to support data interoperability, integration, and promote cost savings.</td>

 . IGS Integrated Data Environment (IDE) Home Back to Solutions Solutions Profiles Integrated Data Environment (IDE) Configure your data for life cycle support Intergraph can help you develop an integrated data environment (IDE) that captures and reuses product data across the enterprise and throughout the product life cycle. Instead of leaving data locked in disconnected legacy systems, partner with Intergraph to realize the full potential of your most sizable investment - the knowledge locked in your information systems. Supporting large, complex, products with long life cycles is extraordinarily complicated. While expensive to design and build, the operational and maintenance costs of these products dwarf their development costs.</td>
