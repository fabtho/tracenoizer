 Cuts energy waste and prevents air related control problems by improving water distribution and system balance. . Spirovent radiant heat air remover from Northeast Radiant Heat - The Radiant Heat Experts Home About N. SPIROVENT removes ALL AIR, including entrained microbubbles, from hydronic heating and cooling systems by means of an air absorption and patented screening process. Stationary air trapped in coils, radiators, deadend risers, or down-curved piping is first absorbed to facilitate further air elimination.</td>

 .PC Cooling - Computer System Coolers - Cables N Mor System Coolers This is a high-performance cooler for your computer system. It cools down the inside of your case by creating air flow. A strong fan draws out the air around your motherboard, your drives, cards, etc. This hot air is then drawn through your power supply and forced out.</td>
