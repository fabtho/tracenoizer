 , so we know that water temperatures from near-shore sites differ from temperatures offshore. . NDBC Science Pages Does water temperature differ between near-shore and offshore sites. The graph shows the average monthly water temperatures from Station 46029 and Station 46005. These two stations are on the same latitude -- about 46 degrees North latitude.</td>

 Information on this page is from A Primer on Water Quality, by Swanson, H. . Geological Survey has been measuring water for decades. Millions of measurements and analyses have been made. Some measurements are taken almost every time water is sampled and investigated, no matter where in the U.</td>

 This expansion and the contraction allow one to read the temperature off a thermometer. . Water in creeks and streams may develop warmer and cooler layers. Cooler water is denser than warmer water and it sinks to the bottom. In cold climates, water temperature may reach to 4 degrees Celsius and below.</td>
