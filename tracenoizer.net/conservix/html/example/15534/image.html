 One think I am pleased about is the sense of optimism and renovations that seems to be present in Greater Manchester, something that I found hard to find as a teenager in the late 1980's. The recent "Queer as Folk" programme has done much to put Manchester on the map over here, even though it is to be shown on TV shortly, lots of people have seen it on video. It has done much to reverse the stereotypical image New Zealanders and Australians can have about Manchester, which is the dull "Cornonation Street" ey-oop, whippets and mushy peas stereotype. Do you have any pictures of the Bloom St, Canal Street area on your photo archive. If not, more please, and how about a Stalybridge photo tour, preferably complete with a picture of West Hill High School which I went to.</td>
