 This cooling kit has all the tools necessary to install a 3. . Our hdd cooler also features an innovative ventilation system powerful enough to circulate cool air into and throughout any PC or external hdd case. This means that it reduces the possibility of data lost due to overheating. A simple way to protect data and hard drives from heat failure.</td>

 300A with a generic single fan heatsink running on an Abit BH6 motherboard. I came to the conclusion that I needed more cooling for the TNT card. I had read where people said to install another fan (or two) at the top of the case to exhaust hot air out. In the near future, I plan to add some sort of temperature sensor to measure the cpu. Another note, I took these pictures with a digital camera, so they aren't the best quality.</td>
