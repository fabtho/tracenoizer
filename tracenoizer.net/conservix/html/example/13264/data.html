 Financial information that is collected is used to check the users' qualifications and bill the user for products and services. Our online surveys ask visitors for contact information (like their email address) and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level). We use contact data from our surveys to send the user information about our company. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor our visitor's experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences.</td>

 As part of our mission to provide educational information to University personnel concerning internal control and business ethics, we are making the video available to BC operating departments. The video is twenty-two minutes long and can be viewed by departments or by individuals. This video is useful for all, from senior executives to data entry personnel. We're sure you will find the video useful for your organization since business information is more vulnerable than ever. To request a copy of the video, email either Pamela Jerskey or Bill Chadwick.</td>
