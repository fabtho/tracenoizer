 INTELLICAST is a registered trademark of WSI Corporation. . It measures the effects of humidity and temperature on the human body in a similar fashion to wind chill. Relative humidity is along the top, and the outside temperature is listed along the left hand side. A "-1" in the table indicates that the heat index temperature is so great it is off the scale.</td>

 As this volume expands it forces the liquid up into the glass tube. . Temperature, Heat, and Internal Energy Temperature Temperature is a description of how hot or cold something is Temperature can be measured by observind a change is some thermometric property of an object Simply touching something is one way to tell whether it is hot or cold or how warm it is. However, our sense of touch is not very accurate and can be fooled. If you reach into a freezer and pick up a metal ice-cube tray and a box of film you have stored there the ice-cube tray will feel colder than the film box--even though they are at the same temperature.</td>

 Targets Improving the operation of a domestic heat pump and of a heat-distribution system, reducing heat losses, saving energy and generally optimizing the whole process are some of the main targets. . Low Temperature Heat Distribution Systems combined with Domestic Heat Pumps Low Temperature Heat Distribution Systems combined with Domestic Heat Pumps Dimitra Sakellari and Per Lundqvist Introduction Considering the operation of heat pumps, it is generally known that it is beneficial to have a low temperature on the condenser side, because the coefficient of performance (COP) is improved and the efficiency is increased. Hence, it is an advantage to have a low-temperature heat sink. As far as domestic heat pumps are concerned it is better to use a low-temperature, heat-distribution system.</td>
