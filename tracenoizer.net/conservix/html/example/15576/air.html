 Study of the layout and experimentation is the best way to develop an efficiently cooled package. .com Air Cooling and Fan Technology Air has mass and thermal capacity. When it's compressed, air transmits hydrostatic pressure. Although it has a rather low specific heat, compared to other fluids, air is the most commonly used medium for heat transfer.</td>

 Cooling below the air's dew point releases condensation first as cloud, and if uplift and cooling continues, as rain, hail or snow. . Cooling Air Cooling Air Many of the common phenomena of weather - clouds, frost, fog and rain - are due to the cooling of air and the consequent condensation of excess water vapour. A common form of contact cooling is radiation cooling. When the Sun sets, the Earth and any other radiating body upon it continue to radiate heat from their supplies.</td>
