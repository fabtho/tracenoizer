 Targets Improving the operation of a domestic heat pump and of a heat-distribution system, reducing heat losses, saving energy and generally optimizing the whole process are some of the main targets. . Low Temperature Heat Distribution Systems combined with Domestic Heat Pumps Low Temperature Heat Distribution Systems combined with Domestic Heat Pumps Dimitra Sakellari and Per Lundqvist Introduction Considering the operation of heat pumps, it is generally known that it is beneficial to have a low temperature on the condenser side, because the coefficient of performance (COP) is improved and the efficiency is increased. Hence, it is an advantage to have a low-temperature heat sink. As far as domestic heat pumps are concerned it is better to use a low-temperature, heat-distribution system.</td>

 . Now MHI has developed new technology of drying system for better energy saving or even creating energy. Features This new drying system shall utilize the waste heat from the indirect heat dryer, for more energy saving. Principle This new drying system is an indirect heat pump system which reuses the evaporated and exhausted steam vapor. The heat of evaporated vapor can be recovered into the recirculating steam at condenser, which is then boosted the heat losses by steam compressor to get the heat energy for sludge drying.</td>
