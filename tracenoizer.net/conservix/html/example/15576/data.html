 The graph shows the average monthly water temperatures from Station 46029 and Station 46005. These two stations are on the same latitude -- about 46 degrees North latitude. Look at the data for November (month 11), Station 46029 has an average water temperature of 11 degrees while Station 46005 has an average water temperature of 13 degrees. You would think that the water temperatures would be very similar to each other. But as you can see from the graph, the water temperatures for July (month 7) through February (month 2) are substantially cooler at Station 46029.</td>
