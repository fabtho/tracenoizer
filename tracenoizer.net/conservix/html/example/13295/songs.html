 This means it's subjective - what works for me may not for you. . Ultimate '80s Songs You can now browse by SONG TITLE. 499 of the 500 songs on this page are linked to lyrics. Originally inspired on a long car ride during which my husband and I named the songs that would be on the ideal compilation CD, this list now consists of songs that I feel best capture the spirit of the 1980s (and a few from outside the 80s).</td>

 The digitalMuse Australian Folk Songs Database Go to The MacScouter Scouting Resources Online, if you arrived here from somewhere else. . It has now expanded beyond Gross Songs to include some good old Campfire Songs, silly songs and chants and songs for Leaders. The Campfire Songs I have tried to include here are ones that are not that easy to find. Turns out that lots of songs we sing around the campfire are copyrighted and cannot be reproduced on a Web Site.</td>

 If you have a song you'd like me to add to this site, just let me know and I'll be happy to include it here if I can. . Included in these pages are an enormous number of songs that I have led and enjoyed over the years at campfires, as well as a growing number of songs sent to me by my friends all over the world. I have tried very hard to break them down into groups that make some sort of sense, but if you think I've mussed something up, please let me know. However, please note that many of these songs are already published in numerous Guiding song books or elsewhere.</td>
