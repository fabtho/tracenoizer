<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" Teachers College, Columbia University has been collaborating with the Dalton School (a K-12 independent school in New York City) on the Dalton Technology Plan. The general aim of this plan is to develop a digital knowledge-base and information infrastructure for all aspects of the K-12 educational experience, and to implement educational strategies designed to make use of this infrastructure, enhancing significantly an already excellent educational experience. In this paper, we describe a framework for SSE design and describe its application to three specific SSEs created as part of the Dalton Technology Plan. After describing the SSEs we report evaluations that demonstrate their effectiveness. The Observation principle is a combination of recommendations by Brown, Collins and Duiguid (1989) and the Cognition and Technology Group at Vanderbilt (1990), but our focus on authentic artifacts is unique.">

 September 1999 32 LEW-16710 Program for Designing a Mechanical System This program offers advantages of ease of use, accuracy, efficiency, and speed April 1999 49 LEW-16622 Software for Minimizing and Removing Burrs in Manufacturing The overall costs of manufacturing precise components would be reduced. March 1999 34 LEW-16583 Improvememnts in Generating and Using Unstructured CFD Grids A grid-generation code accepts data from CAD software. December 1998 44 LEW-16601 Designing With help of Neural-Network and Parallel Computing Large design problems can be solved faster and more efficiently than before. December 1998 52 LEW-16582 Software for Analysis and Design of Turbomachinery These programs can be used to design seals to imporve overall machine performance. March 1997 30 LEW-16323 Computing Off-Design Performances of Axial-Flow Turbines A revised code incorporates improved mathimatical models of flows and losses.</td>

 History is an interactive account of events; every image within it is a passing approximation. Levin (us) Professor in Film Studies at Princeton University Friday, 8. Artists and cultural scientists are therefore increasingly reflecting upon the political, ideological, ethical and aesthetic dimensions of software and software design. The transmediale competition for 'software art' pays tribute to this development. Under discussion are the artistic chances and risks of interactive projects, as well as the rules under which interface design functions.</td>
