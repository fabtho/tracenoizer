 . As the energetic atoms escape, slowly lower the height of the trap using the slider. The goal is to get the temperature as low as possible with the most atoms still in the trap. If you can get the temperature indicator below the "target temperature" indicator you will achieve Bose-Einstein condensation. You can also "mark" an atom by clicking on it, to make it easier to follow one atom's path.</td>

 . However, it has been limited to closely controlled laboratory facilities. Recent measures of body temperature have been shown to closely follow heat production measurements. Body temperature measurements can be easily taken on a frequent basis. This paper discusses the possibility of estimating heat production with body temperature measurements taken at 48-sec intervals.</td>

 Temperature continues to closely track the SOI with a time lag. . The SOI has been inverted to more easily reveal the relationship between the index and temperature. Both graphs represent a 3-month running mean of monthly values of SOI and temperature. The same pattern is even more dramatically shown in 1997-98.</td>
