Cooling Systems Cooling System Overview Below is an explanation of this system's operation Visit The Service Department To Submit Your Problem Or Question Click Here For A More Detailed Graphic And Operation Of This System Click Here To Return To The Auto101 Index The Cooling System The purpose of the engine's cooling system is to remove excess heat from the engine, to keep the engine operating at its most efficient temperature, and to get the engine up to the correct temperature as soon as possible after starting. Ideally, the cooling system keeps the engine running at its most efficient temperature no matter what the operating conditions are. As fuel is burned in the engine, about one-third of the energy in the fuel is converted into power.</td>

The primary job of the cooling system is to keep the engine from overheating by transferring this heat to the air, but the cooling system also has several other important jobs. The engine in your car runs best at a fairly high temperature.</td>
