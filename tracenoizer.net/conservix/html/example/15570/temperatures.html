However, with summer months come hot weather temperatures which can contribute to even a bigger problem, over heating of an aquarium. If you are not fortunate enough to be able to afford an air conditioner to keep the room at a steady temperature, other options are needed to keep your aquarium cooled off.

 Observations collected over the last century suggest that the average land surface temperature has risen 0. The surface of the ocean has also been warming at a similar rate. Studies that combine land and sea measurements have generally estimated that global temperatures have warmed 0. About two-thirds of this warming took place between 1900 and 1940. Global temperatures declined slightly from the 1940s through the 1970s; but have risen more rapidly during the last 25 years than in the period before 1940.</td>

 Boyanowsky says when temperature goes up, inhibitions diminish, causing some people to become aggressive. Heightened levels of interpersonal aggression in southern climates have usually been attributed to cultural differences. race riots in 1967 occurred on days with temperatures greater than 80 degrees Fahrenheit. The temperature remained hot in cities where riots continued, and dropped in those where rioting ended. He says numerous studies have since found a linear relationship between environmental or ambient temperature and assaultive crime.</td>
