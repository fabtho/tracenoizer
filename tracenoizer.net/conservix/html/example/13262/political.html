 Do all men become the same when they approach union with the object of lust. February 22 How to Live in the FRG (1990), 83 min Dir. Most of Farocki's films examine an almost always socio-political theme from a decidedly subjective point of view. They are films which, as Farocki himself once said, are directed against television, against non-committal and easy consumption. His unique style joins formal and political concerns and closely links image and text.</td>
