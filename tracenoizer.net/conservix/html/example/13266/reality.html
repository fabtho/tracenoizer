 These pages contain my own personal views based upon a lifetime of study that extends far beyond the realm of "vampires" alone. I can only present what I think, believe, and sometimes, know to be true. If you are offended by models of reality that differ from your own, please do not enter.

If all of that hasn't scared you off, and you have an open mind.</td>
