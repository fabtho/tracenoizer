 Other texts about the participants Exhibition Nicolas A. . In the course of 1997, Knowbotic Research cooperate with the information engineers of the Kunsthochschule fuer Medien Koeln and the engineers of the Canon Artlab Tokyo in creating an information environment which allows connective construction processes on the internet. In the first phase of the project, three concrete architectural projects are selcted which are in a planning phase in the socalled mega-cities (Tokyo, Sao Paolo and Berlin). They are transformed into electronic fields of development and agency, in order to open them up to collaborative actions in the virtual space of the data networks.</td>

 . A common theme is that we want to understand how to make virtual reality effective. So we carry out experiments with participants, in order to examine just what makes a difference to their sense of presence in the virtual environment, and their sense of co-presence with other people. We research on the issues involved in populating our virtual environments with crowds. This is not only a technically interesting challenge, but we know from our experimental work that empty environments, places without people don't work.</td>
