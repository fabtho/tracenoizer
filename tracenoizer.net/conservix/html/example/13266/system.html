 Back to the OSUNE Research Page Back to the OSUNE Homepage . . All components including software, whose failure could result in a critical safety system failure, are continuously and dynamically tested and verified by hard-wired components. The DSS concept differs substantially from current safety system design philosophy found in LWR safety function systems which rely on static testing of system operability, typically requiring human intervention and off-line testing. Although recently developed digital safety systems do include on-line diagnostics, they do not provide for dynamic on-line self testing that exercises the hardware and software over its full range of expected operation as found in the DSS concept under investigation.</td>
