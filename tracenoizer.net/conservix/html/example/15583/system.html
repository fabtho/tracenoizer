Stationary air trapped in coils, radiators, deadend risers, or down-curved piping is first absorbed to facilitate further air elimination. Permits the continuous operation of an efficient air-free system. Allows fast system start-up without the need for multiple highvents that might drip. Eliminates callbacks due to annoying air noises, insufficient heat, and cold zones.">
