 In the background, it collects and monitors critical NCS telemetry as well as general housekeeping telemetry, and relays commands to the NCS subsystems. . HST Project Science Office - NICMOS Cooling System NICMOS Cooling System The HOST mission on board Space Shuttle Discovery, STS-95, has demonstrated the zero-gravity operation of the reverse turbo-Brayton cycle cryocooler in the NCS. As a result of this successful demonstration, this system will be used to cool the NICMOS instrument after SM3B (2000). These cryogenic coolers allow longer operational lifetimes than is presently possible with expendable cryogenic systems.</td>

 . However, heat pumps generally do not perform well over extended periods of sub-freezing temperatures. The cooling performance of heat pumps, like that of central air conditioners, is rated as a Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (SEER). This is the cooling output divided by the power input for an average U. Heating performance is measured by the Heating Season Performance Factor (HSPF), a ratio of the estimated seasonal heating output divided by the seasonal power consumption for an average U.</td>
