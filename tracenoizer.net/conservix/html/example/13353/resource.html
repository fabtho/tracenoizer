 Is is a general work that provides an overview of the topic or is it specifically focused on only one aspect of your topic. Does the breadth of the work match your own expectations. Does the resource cover the right time period that you are interested in. You are more likely to retrieve articles written for the appropriate audience if you start off in the right index; for instance, to find articles listing the latest statistics on heart disease you may want to avoid the Medline database which will bring up articles designed for praciticing clinicians rather than social science researchers. Evaluating the timeliness of a resource is easy to do even before actually retrieving the source since catalogs and periodical indexes always indicate the publication date in the bibliograhic citation.</td>
