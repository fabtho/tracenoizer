 " For the first time, transmediale organised an award for software art that "recognises the artistic work done by hybrid artist-programmers who are neither 'interactive media artists' or 'net artists', but whose aesthetic material is code and whose expressive form is software programming. . So this festival was firstly oriented toward experimental film and video, but also including interactive media. Supported by Hauptstadtkulturfond, Berlin Senate, European Commission - Media II and Sponsors. 01 includes this year a two-day conference (8-9 February) about the DIY theme, focusing on Software and Net-based Forms of Distribution and Participation.</td>

 The audio-visual and network modules of the eMUSE architecture support scenarios networked in real time and based on Java and the VRML browser. As well as including several persons in a communal real space and depicting this in a virtual environment, eMUSE also allows the participation of spatially distant users via the Internet. The platform provides important components of the performance arts and links them with interactive and networked scenarios - the possibility of free movement in space, the transference of that movement in real time into a virtual environment, the participation of several performers and their interaction with each other. This investigated the practicability of the interface in a public space with a high fluctuation and a heterogeneous user group. The presentation was accompanied by an evaluation of user behaviour to assess the possibility of its use in functional as well as artistic contexts.</td>

 ORG (USA) Gonzalo Frasca has a site with useful, thoughtful essays by him about the nature of games, and computer games in particular. Gonzalo's site also has useful links to other similarly thoughtful sites about games. It combines sound poetry, music, and visual poetry in a most interactive manner. This project also includes an essay called 'Nio and the Art of Interactive Audio for the Web', some new visual poems, and a 'how to' essay on audio programming in Director 8. I have also added an interactive audio section to vispo.</td>
