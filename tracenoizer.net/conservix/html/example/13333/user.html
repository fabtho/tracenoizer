 The pitch of the sound depends on the box location on the screen. They can be dragged (individually or in groups) around the screen, resulting in small tonal differences. The user can create custom grids that can be easily saved and loaded up again later. Different sounds can be applied to the boxes from a floating control panel which is used to control which part of the sound is going to loop as well as the frequency (timing) of it. The number of sounds is limited to 8 and they cycle until the user deselects the box.</td>
