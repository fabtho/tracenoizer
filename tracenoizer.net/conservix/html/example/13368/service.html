 This enhances the functionality and interoperability of the Web. Abstract This document, which has been prepared for the technical subcommittee of PICS (Platform for Internet Content Selection), defines a language for describing rating services. Software programs will read service descriptions written in this language, in order to interpret content labels and assist end-users in configuring selection software. Table of Contents Introduction What is a "rating service". Software programs will read service descriptions written in this language, in order to interpret content labels and assist end-users in configuring selection software.</td>

 The number of cities with a population of more than a million will also double, from 23 in 1992 to 49 by 2001. Related to these statistics are tremendous pressures on the urban infrastructure and the severe deterioration in the quality of urban environment. This can be in form of measuring, and reporting the performance of an institution with respect to its service delivery. Performance measurement could be defined as 'evaluation of policy through a well-defined set of indicators termed as performance indicators'. To address some of these problems, TERI has started an initiative called USERS (Urban Services Environmental Rating System).</td>
