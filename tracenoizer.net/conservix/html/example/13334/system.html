<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" When we work at distances arms length or closer, our eyes are constantly focusing to achieve clear vision. Not surprisingly as a result, when our eyes tire or strain, our head tires and since our head controls how our whole body feels, we get home after a day of near work and our whole body feels exhausted. The main vision related concern from computer use is strain on the focusing system. Some people may have no complaints and function well, others may now recognize a problem in their environment for which they have been unable to pinpoint the cause.

 . Unlike most pattern recognition systems, this approach does not totally rely on the intervention of a human to extract and define a set of features for it. This new system is capable of efficiently searching a database of raw information to match patterns and detect objects. A new pattern recognition and detection technique will help radiologists select suspicious areas of digital mammograms for further study.
