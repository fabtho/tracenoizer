 He worked as a mathematics teacher at a primary school in the Haitian capital, until losing his job, due to cuts in the education budget in 1980. Returning from Croix-des-Bouguets in 1982, Schiller worked on his own in Port-au-Prince exhibiting his work in galleries and stores. Schiller first came to the Turks and Caicos Islands in 1992, trying (like so many of his compatriots) to get away from the political and economic turmoil in his native Haiti. It was then that he made his first contacts with the Bamboo Gallery. He finally moved to the Turks and Caicos Islands permanently in early 1995.</td>

 1447 Vlad II and his eldest son Mircea (who is buried alive) are murdered, possibly by Hungarian assassins. Hungary names Vlad II's successor to the Wallachian throne. 1448 The Turks do not like having a Hungarian puppet ruling Wallachia, so they decide to free Dracula and give him an army. Dracula seizes the Wallachian throne, but rules for only two months before fleeing to Moldavia, which was ruled by his cousin, Prince Bogdan. Advancing Hungarian forces may have forced him into exile; it is also possible that he did not want to be a puppet of the Turks after his imprisonment.</td>
