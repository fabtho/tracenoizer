 If you want to know more about Dracula and Vlad Tepes click here. . Because we are very interrested in Bram Stoker's "Dracula" novel, one of our reasons to go to Romania was to see the places were Vlad Tepes (the original Dracula) had lived. During our trip I made a few beautiful photographs of the Vlad Tepes castles and his birth-house and more pictures of the stunishing landscapes of Romania. Although the photographs are enjoyable at their own, it's more likable when you know what you see, so I placed them in my travel-story completed with some information about Vlad Tepes.</td>
