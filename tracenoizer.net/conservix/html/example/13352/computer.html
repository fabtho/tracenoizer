 The most recent effort is part of the Criminal Law Improvement Act, 1996, which passed First Reading in the House of Commons on March 8 as Bill C-17, "An Act to amend the Criminal Code and to amend certain other Acts. " The key idea is best expressed in the new subsection 487(2. 15(a)(iv) The emphasized clause has significant implications because the phrase "or available to" ignores certain realities of computer communication. Information retrieval and data processing is a distributed and decentralized activity. The volume of data available to computers is growing dramatically, as is the number of sources of that data.</td>
