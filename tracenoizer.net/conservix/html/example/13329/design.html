 Location Reading, Berkshire Modules Modules may vary in line with course development. . This course is taught in the School of Arts and Design at Reading and was validated by Oxford Brookes University in 1999. Reading College became an Associate College of Oxford Brookes University in 1998. Fine Art with Curatorial and Critical Studies has been designed to provide you with an opportunity to develop your own studio practice as an artist and also to engage with the issues surrounding the display of works of art to a public audience and the role of curators (Curatorial Studies) together with the development of theory and the response by professional critics and other writers on art (Critical Studies).</td>

 What Are the Ethical Principles and Codes of Conduct for Research. . To become a consumer of critical research, one must develop certain critical thinking skills about research, such as the ability to read about and understand an investigation; the knowledge to determine the value of the obtained data; the intuitive skills to determine the adequacy of the research design; the experience to determine if there are other explanations for the obtained results; and finally, the good judgment to assess the adequacy of conclusions and claims. Each chapter builds on the information in preceding ones to focus on the importance of research methodology and interpretation rather than mere statistical calculations and analyses. The thorough and extensive coverage of all research methods combined with a focus on critical thinking makes this text truly unique.</td>
