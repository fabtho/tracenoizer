 This covers all aspects of the information revolution. . Computer Systems Lab Home Faculty Staff Students Introduction About CSL Contact Information Directions Research The Computer Systems Laboratory is a joint lab of the Departments of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Stanford University, located in the Gates Computer Science Bulding. Established in 1968, it has grown to include 30 faculty members and 150 Ph. The CSL is internationally recognized for its excellence; the faculty, research staff and students are widely known for their leadership in developing new ideas and trends in the design, organization, and use of computers.</td>

 Such a system would have much more sophisticated notions of identity and protection than those afforded by current operating systems, and it would provide a general-purpose protection system to augment current computer security systems. . Their role in the body is analogous to that of computer security systems in computing. Although there are many differences between living organisms and computer systems, we believe that the similarities are compelling and could point the way to improved computer security. Four examples of how we are applying ideas from immunology to today's computer security problems are a host based intrusion-detection method, a network based intrusion-detection system, a distributable change-detection algorithm, and a method for intentionally introducing diversity to reduce vulnerability.</td>
