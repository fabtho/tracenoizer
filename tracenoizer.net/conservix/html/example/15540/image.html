 . For the preservation world, there is a heavy reliance on high-speed, 1-bit (simple black and white) page images shot at 600 dpi and stored at Group 4 fax-compressed files. This gives an image reminiscent of a microfilm image. For a straightforward printed page with no graphics, 1-bit imaging maintains the ability to read the content but it gives no sense of the page as an artifact -- no shading, no color, etc. What we here call archival imaging assumes that one's needs are for high quality images that replicate not simply the information on a page -- as a black and white image does for typeset material at least -- but the experience and visual nuances of the original.</td>
