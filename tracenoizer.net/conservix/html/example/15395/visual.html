 html These were extreme reactions to an extreme period - Gina Pane, for example, explained that she did what she did "in order to reach an anaesthetised society". Burden felt he was re-enacting "certain American classics - like shooting people". You may well be thinking that visual art concerns images and three-dimensional objects, made by the artist; that it has nothing to do with performances.

 But promoting seven artists and seven viewpoints is, of course, not the only objective of FOCUS. 01, faculties from the University of the Philippines College of Fine Arts were invited. Five experts in the fields of the Studio Arts, Art Theory, Art Criticism and History, and Visual Communication were given the task of looking into the proposals for FOCUS. For many of these members in the proposal deliberations, it is a first time to be intimately involved in the pre-production and conceptual stage of new media art. This is significant because in the road to broadening access, understanding and appreciation of new media art forms, it helps to start from the conceptualization stage of these new art forms.</td>
