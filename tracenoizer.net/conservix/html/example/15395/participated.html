 Part of the effects of the electronic monastery are seen in mainstream art circles as the lack of serious critical writing about new media art and the persistence of writing that used comparative analysis between new media art and the earlier art forms such as painting and sculpture. This could seriously dwarf critical thinking, understanding and production in new media art by setting the same parameters and standards for very distinct and exciting new modes of artistic expression. 01, fusing traditional practices with new media was one of the conditions in the effort to see how technological means of expression augmented, complemented or participated in the dynamics of the long tradition of artistic language forming. Using the same set of parameters for net art and painting is an example of pushing the incompatibility. Because no established set of parameters may as yet be said to exist in critically analyzing new media art, it seems unavoidable that the reliable terms in previous art forms are being used.</td>
