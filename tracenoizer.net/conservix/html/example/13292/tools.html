 Indeed, in recent weeks the Internet has been deluged with discussion of this highly controversial security tool. Designed as a powerful program that remotely analyzes the security holes on a networked system, it has been criticized extensively as a tool for hackers instead of system administrators. Unlike the security tools COPS and Tiger, which are run on a given host and analyze the security of that particular host by checking a list of common security loopholes, SATAN runs on a given host and analyzes the security of other networked hosts in an intelligent manner that involves more than just going down a list of loopholes. Thus any system with IP connectivity to the host running SATAN can be the victim of a SATAN probe. There exist security tools such as ISS that rely on this remote examination procedure.</td>
