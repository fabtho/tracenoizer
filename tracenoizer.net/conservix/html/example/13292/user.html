 The architecture was prototyped in the Fluke research operating system. Several of the Flask interfaces and components were then ported from the Fluke prototype to the OSKit. The Flask architecture is now being implemented in the Linux operating system (Security-Enhanced Linux) to transfer the technology to a larger developer and user community. The DTOS project improved upon the earlier design and implementation work, yielding a prototype that was released to universities for research (e. As the DTOS project approached its completion, a new joint effort was started by the NSA, SCC, and the University of Utah's Flux project to transfer the DTOS security architecture into the Fluke research operating system.</td>
