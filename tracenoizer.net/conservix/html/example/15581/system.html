 The links for each product are simple text files showing a one line entry for each product cycle over the past 24 hours. Each entry indicates the run-time diagnostic information as described in the parameter description header in each file. Additional information regarding special circumstances will also be provided as needed in the 'remarks' area for each product system. ..</td>

 Again, this is only likely to be a factor in the higher-performance situations, and then only if they do a lot of memcpy-ing. . Because of this, it is important for the the host system to meet the system requirements outlined on the EDT data sheets. Within the system requirements, the word recommended shows up from time to time. This should not be taken as an indication that the interfaces will perform poorly if run in a system that doesn't meet the recommendations.</td>

 The computing and networking industry in turn has responded by increasing microprocessor clock speeds and introducing network processors, required to support this data processing need. Increased CPU speeds, however, are only part of the solution. In a typical embedded system, the bottleneck is at the system interconnect level, i. the speed at which various components "inside the box" communicate with each other. It is a low latency, memory-address based protocol that is scalable, reliable, supports multi-processing and is transparent to application software.</td>
