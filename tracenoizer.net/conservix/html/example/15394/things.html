 Korzybski believed there was a very poor connection between language and objective reality. At the very core of his indictment of language was one small culprit, the word "is". He located our most serious semantic problem in the everyday act of naming or describing things. If we say the earth is round we get ourselves into difficulties that could be avoided by instead saying the earth appears to be round. The word is not the thing, just as the map is not the territory.</td>
