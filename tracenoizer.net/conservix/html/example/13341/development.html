 In this latest volume CAE brings to a climax a series of brilliantly illuminating texts, in which, over the last decade, they have succeeded in forging one of the few lexicons powerful enough to theorize the issues and technologies at the heart of today's activist cultures. .00 Digital Resistance is the most recent installment in the Critical Art Ensemble's development of the theory and forms of tactical media practices. We can trespass in them all, inventing molecular interventions and unleashing semiotic shocks that collectively could negate the rising intensity of authoritarian culture. Once again CAE has produced an essential tool kit for the intelligent cultural hacker, artist, and hacktivist.</td>

 ; a leading-edge organization specializing in behavior-based safety training and consulting. Geller and his partners have helped companies across the country and around the world tap into the benefits of their research-tested principles and industry-proven tools. In this capacity, he has authored more than 300 research articles and over 50 books or chapters addressing the development and evaluation of behavior-change interventions to improve quality of life. He is a widely sought-after speaker at safety and industrial conferences, such as ASSE, NSC, and VPPPA. He has addressed audiences throughout the world including Africa, Asia, Australia, and Europe.</td>

 Later some of this mathematics was translated into Latin and became the mathematics of Western Europe. Over a period of several hundred years, it became the mathematics of the world. By far, the most significant development in mathematics was giving it firm logical foundations. This took place in ancient Greece in the centuries preceding Euclid. Logical foundations give mathematics more than just certainty-they are a tool to investigate the unknown.</td>
