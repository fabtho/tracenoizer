 It lays out a logico-historical thread to help make some sense of our switched-on disjunctive techno world. Electronic Civil Disobedience is promised for the Winter of 1995. The Projects sections is fairly lively with such titles as ADDICTIONMANIA, USELESS TECHNOLOGY, and CULTRONIX. It contrasts pseudo ads for hi-tech weaponry with pseudo catalogue listings for hi-tech kitchen appliances.
