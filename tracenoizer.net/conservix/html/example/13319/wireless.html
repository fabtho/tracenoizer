 . People are spending more and more time away from their office desks, yet they want to have reliable access to corporate networks and the Internet. The Nokia Wireless LAN solution provides an excellent way to extend the reach of local area networks (LANs). Instead of plugging into a wired LAN wall outlet, you can quickly connect to the corporate network through your PC and wireless LAN card for easy access to broadband data rates without wires. Wireless LAN access zones at airports, hotels and other public places also allow users to connect to their corporate network via the Internet, while the full range of security features offer users reliable access to network resources.</td>
