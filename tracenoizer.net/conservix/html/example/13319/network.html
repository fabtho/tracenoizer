 .com, a TechTarget site for Networking professionals. com homepage local area network A local area network (LAN) is a group of computers and associated devices that share a common communications line and typically share the resources of a single processor or server within a small geographic area (for example, within an office building). Usually, the server has applications and data storage that are shared in common by multiple computer users. A local area network may serve as few as two or three users (for example, in a home network) or many as thousands of users (for example, in an FDDI network).</td>

 People are spending more and more time away from their office desks, yet they want to have reliable access to corporate networks and the Internet. The Nokia Wireless LAN solution provides an excellent way to extend the reach of local area networks (LANs). Instead of plugging into a wired LAN wall outlet, you can quickly connect to the corporate network through your PC and wireless LAN card for easy access to broadband data rates without wires. Wireless LAN access zones at airports, hotels and other public places also allow users to connect to their corporate network via the Internet, while the full range of security features offer users reliable access to network resources. The Nokia D211 multi-mode radio card for your PC gives you network access through GPRS, HSCSD, or Wireless LAN networks.</td>
