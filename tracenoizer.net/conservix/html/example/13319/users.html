com, a TechTarget site for Networking professionals. com homepage local area network A local area network (LAN) is a group of computers and associated devices that share a common communications line and typically share the resources of a single processor or server within a small geographic area (for example, within an office building). Usually, the server has applications and data storage that are shared in common by multiple computer users. A local area network may serve as few as two or three users (for example, in a home network) or many as thousands of users (for example, in an FDDI network). Users who need an application frequently can download it once and then run it from their local hard disk.</td>
