 My comp has been messed up, and the guy who is fixing it said it will take a while. I will get into contact with Josh so we can start adding more stuff to the site. Well I feel pretty good now so I'll try to get some new updates on the site as soon as I can. Also we could use a couple new affiliates if anyone is interested. htmlIf you haven't done so already go there and sign it.</td>

 It's a really tough job when you have to work with somebody who is just repulsive to look at. I tell you, I mean, you have to wear blinders to be able to look at a face like that. He appeals to the girls so much because when you're with him you know its dangerous, but he makes you feel safe. Paul, where we shot this movie and so I got to be real good friends with him and he'd take me to the ins and outs, all the good spots, and we hung out with his friends from college and stuff and it was great. I bet you'll like him even more when you see him as Trip Fontaine.</td>
