geeks galore Josh On Josh On has the kind of Web site that make you wonder when he'll get a talent agent and become a celebrity. He's got too much talent to waste online; that's for sure.

The series is hosted by actor and Kentucky native Josh Hopkins, who can be seen in the upcoming movie G. The series is closed-captioned for the deaf, and hard-of-hearing. .</td>
