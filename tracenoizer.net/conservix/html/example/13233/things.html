 . He loved feeling that he had really reached an audience. Everybody in the music business was listening the best things we do as human beings were not conscious of it just happens I think that's true of songwriting and anything creative. They knew he'd make it, and even started to follow him around with a documentary film camera. he preferred recording in his canyon home, rather than a studio.</td>

 May 25, 2001 JOSH HARTNETT is everywhere -- as he takes a bite out of the big screen in 'Pearl Harbor' and talks it up in the July issue of Vanity Fair. Find out what he told the mag tonight on ET -- and read on as JANN CARL caught up with Hollywood's resident hunk in Hawaii. Did you think about how things would change for you when you said yes to this movie. I talked to my dad about it, to see if he agreed with the decision that I was about to make. Then when I signed on to do this I read an awful lot about it, and I met some of the survivors.</td>

 If we were to poll collectors of paperbacks, I would expect to find that the cover of The Camp on Blood Island is one of the most enduring -- so good that Hammer even put it on the movie poster as a tiny vignette. So, my opinion is that Josh has nothing to be embarrassed about. Obviously we're not carrying the memory of arguing with editors and being asked to alter things -- we don't know what vision he originally had for each cover. But we do know the printed end result and, believe me, they're great. By the way, Cee Tee Man was in a different file, which is why it doesn't show up here.</td>
