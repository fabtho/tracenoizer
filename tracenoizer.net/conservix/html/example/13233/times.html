 This program is on radios all over the country so for SURE josh's name is getting out there. cause if we can hear him in winnipeg, he's got to be on in toronto, montreal or vancouver . Josh has been on the infamous Z100 show several times a day - which is 100. I thought I read in a post not too long ago about a few people hearing Josh on the radio. I think my screams Saturday night were enough to let ANYONE know that Josh was on the radio.</td>
