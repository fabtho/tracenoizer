 " The impact of the system has been dramatic, affecting both the top line and bottom line of the company's financials, with greater sales and distribution penetration effected by capitalizing on missed opportunities and significantly reduced labor and maintenance costs in maintaining an antiquated paper-based digital asset lifecycle. . For the information technology team, the system foundation would have to be progressive, with a forward-looking technology framework that will evolve with a new generation of tools maturing during the development life cycle. Prior to implementation of the Rights Management System, workflow support for asset creation, maintenance and distribution was pre-dominantly a manual process with small pockets of automation. With all rights and ancillary information stored as physical files in large cabinets, the sheer volume of assets was a hindrance when searching, appending, cross-referencing let alone analyzing information for sales and distribution opportunities.</td>
