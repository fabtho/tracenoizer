 If this works, we would like to spread this technology near and far. From there, imagine a phone that uses your base station when you are in your house, but uses the net when you are out of range. At different points, this wireless traffic is put on the Internet backbone. Aspen now has such a network for anyone with an equipped laptop in the downtown cafes and the like (ref Harvie Branscomb). ISP's are using this technology now, but mostly for point-to-point connections to avoid the phone company charges.</td>
