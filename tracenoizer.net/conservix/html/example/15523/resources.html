 . The ESSC Curriculum Testbed is a 3-year project that will include 12 high schools and 6 universities from around the country (statistics). These resources are not readily available in the classroom. Our strategy is to develop these resources as part of our national education information infrastructure by cultivating a community of teachers, students, and scientists devoted to enabling students to investigate the Earth system. Our plan for managing the testbed focuses on community, curriculum, and system development.</td>
