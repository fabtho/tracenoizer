 Develop a comprehensive water research program with statewide impact by utilizing faculty and facility resources at Indiana's institutions of higher education. . Purdue University - Indiana Water Resources Research Center Program Overview The Indiana Water Resources Research Center (IWRRC) is one of 54 institutes in the National Water Research Institute Program established by "The Water Resources Research Act of 1964". Our program (based on research, student training, and technology transfer) is a unique network which has links to virtually all research-oriented universities in the United States. IWRRC faculty represent a tremendous resource of knowledge and expertise relating to water resources.</td>

 USGS also provides partial support for the State Water Resources Research Institutes, including management of a competetive grants program as authorized under the Water Resources Research Act. . Relevant hydrologic information provided by the USGS is available today to assist the Nation in solving its water problems because of a conscious decision made in years past to invest in research. The NRP is designed to encourage pursuit of a diverse agenda of research topics aimed at providing new knowledge and insights into varied and complex hydrologic processes that are not well understood. The emphasis of these research activities changes through time, reflecting the emergence of promising new areas of inquiry and the demand for new tools and techniques with which to address water-resources issues.</td>
