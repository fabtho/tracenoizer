 Heck, over at Fox's cable entry FX they have a brand new tv show based on these sort of quizzes. It's called the Test and it has some interactive quizzes you can do in your underwear. But that got us to thinking, hmm, I wonder where I stand on the video game political Richter scale. So came the birth of the VIDEO GAME POLITICAL IDENTITY QUIZ. The quiz is twenty questions that should help you figure out where you stand in the political arena.</td>
