 Consistent with these philosophical arguments for the centrality of interpretation in cognition are the many research results from cognitive psychology showing that understanding involves making a large number of inferences (Black, 1984; Black, 1985). Thus, the key consideration in designing a SSE is fostering the construction of interpretations based on observations and background contextual information. Teachers College, Columbia University has been collaborating with the Dalton School (a K-12 independent school in New York City) on the Dalton Technology Plan. The general aim of this plan is to develop a digital knowledge-base and information infrastructure for all aspects of the K-12 educational experience, and to implement educational strategies designed to make use of this infrastructure, enhancing significantly an already excellent educational experience. In this paper, we describe a framework for SSE design and describe its application to three specific SSEs created as part of the Dalton Technology Plan.</td>

 His knowledge of incremental computing was later to be the basis for practical computer graphics. . Institute of Technology In the early sixties, few computers ran "on line. " Instead, most computers ran "batches" of jobs submitted by users to the computer operators who scheduled the jobs to keep the computer fully occupied. Turn around time for each job was usually an hour or more, and often overnight.</td>
