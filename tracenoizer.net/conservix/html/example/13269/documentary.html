<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" The selections in American Life reveal a variety of regional American values and identities and how they are evolving over time. These artists explore a rich array of American characters, from the oldest known living African-American lesbian to a Southern mother and daughter prying into their own family secrets, from the odd goings-on in a small Tennessee town to the graceful motions of an ordinary suburban lawn sprinkler. Re-Thinking Documentary includes works that recast the documentary genre, thereby turning the documentary's gaze on itself. Jill Godmilow remakes a 1969 German documentary by Harun Farocki about Dow Chemical's development of napalm-B during the Vietnam War, this time in color and in English. By condensing Alfred Hitchcock's 1945 film Spellbound from 111 minutes to just under eight minutes, LeVeque transforms Hitchcock's trademark slow-paced suspense-building into a rushing sense of the inevitable.">
