 The group's research interests cover areas such as Computer Aided Learning, assessment mechanisms, collaborative learning environments and course management systems. The most significant development to emerge from the group to date has been the Ceilidh and the CourseMaster systems. Ceilidh is a general course management system whose core is an automatic-assessment facility for marking students' computer programs. Ceilidh has been used to teach classes of up to 160 at Nottingham and was adopted as the basis of a three year development throughout UK Higher education funded under the UFC's Teaching and Learning Technology Programme (TLTP). It has been taken by over 300 institutions of higher education in over 30 countries.</td>

 The only overhead encountered is in the first Dienst protocol request to an Apache thread and, of course, the additional memory payload of each Apache thread. HTTP Configuration Dienst can run in conjunction with an existing Apache Web server, which provides standard HTTP functionality to your organization. System Requirements Operating System All of the Perl code in Dienst will run on any computer system that supports Perl (many flavors of UNIX, many flavors of Windows, MacOS). In the future, we hope to support at least parts of the Dienst software on Windows NT or Windows 2000. Hardware Any system that is capable of hosting a Web server should be capable of running Dienst.</td>
