 . Learning Technology Research Learning Technology Research The Learning Technology Research Group was set up within the Department of Computer Science at Nottingham University to research into the use of computer technology to support education. The group's research interests cover areas such as Computer Aided Learning, assessment mechanisms, collaborative learning environments and course management systems. The most significant development to emerge from the group to date has been the Ceilidh and the CourseMaster systems. Ceilidh is a general course management system whose core is an automatic-assessment facility for marking students' computer programs.</td>
