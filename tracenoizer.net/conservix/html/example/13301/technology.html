 Department of Education, this guide is intended as an informal introduction to various assessment techniques that schools, districts, and individuals might use to evaluate local technology initiatives. . Please note that research on K-12 educational technology still relies heavily on survey data (tracking usage rather than measurable differences in student achievement and teacher pedagogy), self-assessment, and correlation to standardized test scores. More sophisticated evaluation measures and more long-term, in-depth research is needed. html Margaret Honey, Katherine McMillan Culp, and Fred Carrig This paper offers a perspective that grows out of what staffers at EDC's Center for Children and Technology have learned from nearly three decades of research on educational technology.</td>
