Returning from Croix-des-Bouguets in 1982, Schiller worked on his own in Port-au-Prince exhibiting his work in galleries and stores. Schiller first came to the Turks and Caicos Islands in 1992, trying (like so many of his compatriots) to get away from the political and economic turmoil in his native Haiti. It was then that he made his first contacts with the Bamboo Gallery. He finally moved to the Turks and Caicos Islands permanently in early 1995.</td>

" Due only to the courage and skill of the crew, the surviving vessels were able to return to Sevastopol. While the Russians were struggling with the elements, the Turks concentrated 42 vessels in the Dnieper Firth, where the army of Potemkin was on the offensive. The only sea-borne opposition to the enemy was the Liman flotilla of Rear Admiral Nikolay Mordvinov. However, Mordvinov was not quick enough to attack the Turkish fleet, and the enemy had sufficient time to move 5,000 troops onto the Kinburn spit.</td>
