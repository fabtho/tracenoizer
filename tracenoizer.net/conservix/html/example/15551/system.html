 The network describes the mutual exclusivity or compatibility of the various options (in Gazdar et al. (1985)'s terms, feature co-occurrence restrictions, although the concept has been in use in Systemics since the early sixties). A system network consists of a set of systems, each system representing choices in paradigmatic opposition (mutually exclusive choices). The ordering of systems from left to right in the network is read as more delicate specification of the options available. The further structural options available for the unit are developed by the systems to right of this basic choice.</td>
