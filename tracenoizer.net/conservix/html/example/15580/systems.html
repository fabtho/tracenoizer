 Engineering assessments for optimizing compressed air systems that focus on end use load, distribution network, and the primary compressor plant. . We have experience with standard AC motor drive systems, as well as with engine driven units or VFD controlled machines. ERS has proprietary analysis models that determine energy use of existing or proposed systems, and develop optimum operating strategies for multi-compressor plants. Assessment of these systems is regularly integrated into our air system modeling and optimization studies.</td>

 Whereas humans easily become experts for mapping from images to text (e. , a radio reporter describing a soccer game) or from text to images (e. , a cartoonist transforming a story into a comic strip), such complex transformations are a great challenge for computer systems. In multimodal communication humans utilize a combination of text and images (e. , illustrated books, sub-titles for animations) taking advantage of both the individual strength of each communication mode and the fact that both modes can be employed in parallel.</td>
