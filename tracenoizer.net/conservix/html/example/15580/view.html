The text definitions also have letter or number sign images to aid in visualizing the sign. This will allow you to quickly locate a word, read how to sign the word, and choose to view the animated sign if you wish. It is easy to remember this if you imagine that someone is signing to you while you are viewing the word definitions. These actions help give meaning to what is being signed, much like vocal tones and inflections give meaning to spoken words.">

 Photographers manipulate composition, lighting and color to create subliminbal messsages and evoke emotions in the subconscious of the viewer. This program shows how Learning to read and write in visual language requires and understanding of basic elements such as lines, shapes, forms, textures. It also requires understanding how to arrange these elements within the frame for an effective composition; and, how to translate a three-dimensional world onto a two-dimensional surface through the use of visual triggers such as shadows, point of view, depth of field and perspective. ..</td>

The high school general art course is one that might be taken by students who are interested in art, but who are not attracted to studio art courses.

As electives, courses such as these can serve a potentially large population of students who typically have not elected art in high school. .</td>
