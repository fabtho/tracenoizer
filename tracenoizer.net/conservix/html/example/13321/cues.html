<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" Phonemes are categorized into two broad categories, consonants and vowels. Consonant are cued with handshapes and vowels with hand placements. Eight handshapes and four placements are sufficient to represent the twenty-five consonants and fifteen vowels that occur in English because cues are used in conjunction with speechreading; cues need only distinguish between phonemes that look the same on the lips. An entire utterance is cued by mentally dividing it into consonant-vowel pairs and then forming the consonant's handshape while moving the hand to the vowel's placement for each pair. All cues occur while speaking (or at least mouthing).">
