 The free scanner can be picked up at any RadioShack, or may be ordered for mail delivery at the CueCat web site (the mail offer also includes a video convergence cable in the shipping charge). The motivation behind this free giveaway is for people to use these scanners to swipe ordinary product UPC's as well as special bar codes called cues that appear in the Radio Shack catalog and other print publications like Wired and Forbes. The scanner operates off your computer keyboard port, so this swiping action causes the CRQ software included with the unit to launch your web browser and go to the specific web page for the bar code that was swiped. The convergence cable does a similar thing for your TV. The CED Title Excel Macro has been available at CED Magic since 1997, but until now most users have had to manually type in the UPC's due to the expense of getting a scanner for what may be a one time use.</td>
