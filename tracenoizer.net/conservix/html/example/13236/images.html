 Faced with the Vietnam war right at the start of his career as a cineast, Farocki invented, with Feu inextinguible, an original way of talking about napalm designed to shock and awaken the spectator (we see him burning his hand with his cigarette). . Ce film-essai rassemble des images d'origines multiples (dessins, photographies, peintures, etc. Ces images sont pour la plupart des images montrant des machines. Farocki analyse ici le dispositif de la photographie de guerre, entre conservation et destruction.</td>

 Unfortunately, the lecture feels stiff and uncinematic, and the documentary material rambling. " but the 1990 How to Live in the German Federal Republic, shot at job-training classes of various types, marshals plenty of evidence to the contrary. Opening with a hospitalized woman proudly declaring her commitment to the resistance and asserting "We don't want a dictator," the film closes with images of Ceausescu's corpse taken after his execution less than two weeks later. Rather than making a straightforward documentary, Farocki and codirector Andrej Ujica have opted for a reflexive approach that pays as much attention to formal concerns as to the political changes themselves. Watching these films consecutively reveals that Farocki can't match the consistency of Marker or Resnais, but even if his experiments sometimes fail, Images of the World makes an excellent case for his inquisitive brand of filmmaking.</td>
