 . I have assembled a group of temperature and performance readings for real-world applications and synthetic benchmarks. What I have found is that while all of the programs help to keep the CPU from running as warm, some of the versions of CPUIdle don't seem to be very effective in keeping the processor cool during file transfers. (The latest versions of CPUIdle use either depending of the mode you choose. There have been reports of different problems associated with each of these programs, ranging from locked up computers (infrequent) to static coming through the system speakers (not uncommon).</td>
