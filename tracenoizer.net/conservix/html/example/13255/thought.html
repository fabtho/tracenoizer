 Generally bar codes are used to price commodities like Tide, eggs and soup. And Digital Convergence tracks the behavior of Cue Cat users, selling the information to third parties. I asked him if he thought having a branded bar code printed at the top of many of their news stories compromised the separation between editorial and management. It's a marketing triple play, synthesizing marketing messages from the internet, print and television. Cue Cat instantly takes your browser to the exact information you want.</td>

 WGI helped create the SEO field 6 years ago and we're not done yet. This issue takes a fresh approach, call it zoom and bloom. Jaco hears the site destination for heady thought is thinking, ahem, ahead. The catch is you have to guess the celebrity, but it's worth it because you can win prizes ranging from a Mazda Miata to a trip to the 2002 BLOCKBUSTER Movie Awards show in L. IAB GM Larry Kaufman sends Jaco rescheduled dates for the Professional Development Series (May 31 in NYC, June 7 in EssEff).</td>
