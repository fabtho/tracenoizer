<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" In an application requiring both heating and cooling, the design should focus on the cooling mode. Using a thermoelectric in the heating mode is very efficient because all the internal heating (Joulian heat) and the load from the cold side is pumped to the hot side. This reduces the power needed to achieve the desired heating. Thermal Parameters Needed The appropriate thermoelectric for an application, depends on at least three parameters. These parameters are the hot surface temperature (Th), the cold surface temperature (Tc), and the heat load to be absorbed at the cold surface (Qc).">

 The exhaust fan inlet faces adjacent PCI or AGP cards and makes a great video card cooler for hot running 3D accelerator cards like the Voodoo, TNT2, GeForce256 and others. A quiet running brushless DC motor coupled with a high efficiency blade design is capable of moving 36 CFM (cubic feet per minute) of air. Power is supplied to the fan using a standard LP4 (hard drive power connector) pass through plug. ..</td>

 How to Avoid Overheating Electronic Components Overheated electronics cabinets contribute to production problems for myriad manufacturing lines. Reliable enclosure coolers can ease this burden and help boost your company's bottom line and production efficiency. Cooling a Process Line of Sample Coolers In water-intensive industries such as power plants and pulp-and-paper facilities, it is crucial that the water utilized is sampled frequently, even continuously, to ensure acceptability to the process. Find out just what an understatement this is when George Briley shares a story about what not to do when suction pressure is zero (gauge), but your holding freezer tempeature is rising faster than it has for the past couple of weeks. Chill Out A column dedicated to the proposition that fun is an essential part of business.</td>
