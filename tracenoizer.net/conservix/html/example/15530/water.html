pdf) PNL TechFocus ORNL's New Programs For FEMP and FEMP Technology Focus on GFX (pdf) Bob Vila's Habitat Blitz Build Cobb Hill -1st U. nonresidential, commercial, industrial, state and federal applications increases potential savings to over 7 billion equivalent gallons of oil per year. Perhaps the most important and tangible benefit to owners of all-electric homes is GFX's ability to triple the shower-capacity of an electric water heater and halve the cost of a hot-shower. For example, whenever GFX boosts the cold water temperature by 30 degrees, it's recycling about 10 kW of power from drain water; more than enough to triple your family's showering-time and save 2 kW of energy per shower. Other ramifications of GFX are discussed by Editor J.</td>
