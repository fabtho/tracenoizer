 Note that, at least 600mA ATX standby current is required to support the LAN card for this function. . WOL (Wake On LAN) WOL (Wake On LAN) This feature is very similar as WOM (Zero Voltage Wake On Modem), but it goes through local area network. To use Wake On LAN function, you must have a network card with chipset that supports this feature, and connect a cable from LAN card to motherboard WOL connector. The system identification information (probably IP address) is stored on network card and because there is a lot of traffic on the Ethernet, you need to install a network management software, such as ADM, for the checking of how to wake up the system.</td>
