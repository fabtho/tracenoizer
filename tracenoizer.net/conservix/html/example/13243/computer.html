 So the precautions in this section apply to you whether you are connected via a full-time or connect-as-needed dial-up connection. There are many things you can do to secure your network, depending on your level of paranoia, and how much money you have to spend. If you've followed my instructions for sharing your connection, you either are running a sharing program in a computer that has two Ethernet adapters (NICs), or your LAN is behind a hardware router. Sharing your connection via the multiple IP method does not provide the protection of a separate LAN. Also uncheck Microsoft Family Logon if it is present.</td>

 Special thanks to Cisco for their support in creating this article. If you have read other How Stuff Works articles on networking or the Internet, then you know that a typical network consists of nodes (computers), a connecting medium (wired or wireless) and specialized network equipment like routers or hubs. In the case of the Internet, all of these pieces work together to allow your computer to send information to another computer that could be on the other side of the world. They make it possible for several users to send information over a network at the same time without slowing each other down. Just like routers allow different networks to communicate with each other, switches allow different nodes (a network connection point, typically a computer) of a network to communicate directly with one another in a smooth and efficient manner.</td>
