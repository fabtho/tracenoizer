 It is made up of servers, workstations, a network operating system and a communications link. Servers are high-speed machines that hold programs and data shared by network users. Diskless and floppy-only workstations are sometimes used, which retrieve all software and data from the server. Increasingly, "thin client" network computers (NCs) and Windows terminals are also used. A printer can be attached locally to a workstation or to a server and be shared by network users.</td>
