" "Some critics said the dramatization is little better than a public service announcement," the CNS article observed. "Family groups feared the movie had a pro-homosexual slant and depicted only one side of a complicated story. Peter LaBarbera of the Culture and Family Institute questioned why NBC chose to air a program about Shepard but ignore the case of Jesse Dirkhising, a 13-year-old who was murdered by two homosexuals in 1999.
