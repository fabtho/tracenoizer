 . These models are complex dynamic fields, which produce an exchange between virtual agents, poetic machines and interactive visitors. Knowbotic Research outlines technoid events parallel in real and virtual spaces to investigate the experience of the multiple layers of reality. The organization is based in Cologne at the Academy for Media Arts. With the partners of Westbank Industries and Tactile Technology Knowbotic Research has founded mem_brane, a laboratory for media strategies.</td>

 The shapes and incorporations prevailing in this space are still being developed and expanded. So far, the system has evolved as a link between universities and 'super computer' centers, remaining more or less in the shadow of political and economic interests. But if we want to prevent this data space (consistently growing in size and complexity due to the incipient commerzialization of the network) from becoming just a failed duplicate of reality, then we must not view data landscape and networked communities as a mere program engineering and marketing problem within a self-regulating technocracy. The possibility of constructing reality (or several realities. ), and the opportunities inherent in the networked worlds which can be derived from them, has given rise to a general sense of insecurity and disconcertion for the public spheres.</td>
