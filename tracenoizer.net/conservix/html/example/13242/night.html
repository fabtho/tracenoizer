<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" I mean, think about it, a 2-year-old huster in a trash can outside a truck stop. Well, it's not actually not my prom, but a junior at my school asked me to go so I am going. I rented Snatch last night because I've never seen it. It looked pretty cool when I watched it last night but I watched like the first 15 minutes of it and then I fell asleep. Holy crap, I really need to make a new layout fast.">

 . I have always been the one to dwell on a somber thought and bottle it up, harnassing the energy created by that clashing of emotional elements, trying to draw from it. I spent the night at a friends house downtown on saturday night. We walked around the town like idiots, quite overdoing ourselves with caffeine and nicotine (gasp. I like waking up downtown and walking out in to the streets, with everyone around and sounds everywhere.</td>
