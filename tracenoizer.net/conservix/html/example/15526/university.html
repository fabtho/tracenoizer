 . The History of Shakespeare at Winedale The History of Shakespeare at Winedale Shakespeare at Winedale began as an English Department course in 1970. As the program grew in size and reputation, it began to attract students from outside the English Department and eventually beyond the University of Texas. In 1998, Shakespeare at Winedale undertook its first international venture, as a specially selected group of former students traveled to London to perform by invitation at Shakespeare's Globe Theatre. We have also been involved in exchanges with British actors, directors and scholars.</td>
