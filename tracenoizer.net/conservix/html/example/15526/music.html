 According to Buljan, the staging of Koltes is extremely interesting. . His performances explore modern theatre forms, interlacing classical theatre, movement, music and visual arts. The Slovenian, French and Croatian co-production The Name at the Tip of the Tongue vombines traditional folk tales and psychoanalytical studies. Pylade by Pier Paolo Pasolini is a rhetorical performance based on one of the major works of European dramaturgy.</td>

 In the 1970s, Paik began a series of tapes, including Global Groove (1973), that were extraordinarily influential and innovative. Applying surreal conceptual wit and "neo-Dada" irony, he established a radical syntax of video based on the visual and aural grammar of television, appropriating and then derailing its very language. Densely layered with witty intertextual references and transcultural content, his exuberant, disjunctive collages function as a stream-of-consciousness flow of images, music and electronic effects. Paik engages in kinetic cultural explorations as a form of global communications, as if he were switching television channels around the world. The richly layered and textured alterations of his later works exhibit the tour-de-force imaging techniques of longtime collaborator Paul Garrin.</td>
