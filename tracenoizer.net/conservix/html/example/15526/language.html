0 supports the next generation of Web-based applications using Dynamic HTML classes. Dynamic HTML classes enable developers to create robust cross-platform applications combining HTML, script code, and the DOM (document object model). 0 enables developers to harness the flexibility of DHTML without having to master a scripting language or the DOM. The combination of this class framework and RAD tool make it easy to build fast and powerful applications and components for the Microsoft platform using the Java language.
