 The program was designed to interface with an existing computer- aided component layout and routing routine and to be user interactive. . Computer-Aided Heat Sink Design for Printed Wiring Boards. Abstract A computer-aided design (CAD) program has been developed which generates a graphical layout of a printed wiring board (PWB) showing its fundamental characteristics, automatically performs a heat sink design for conductively cooled in-line PWBs, and sets up a working data base containing generated thermal characteristics for subsequent thermal and reliability analysis. The program was designed to interface with an existing computer- aided component layout and routing routine and to be user interactive.</td>

 This cooler is a must to aggressively overclock your graphics board. The Stealth V2 Cooler, which has all the key components thermally connected to the hot chips. The low profile design is particularly useful for tight spaces or space constrained designs (click here to read more about the Lasagna Slim Cooler for single microprocessor). Standard Stealth also fits Micro Conversions Game Wizard Voodoo2 Board for Mac. It is very easy to install the Stealth V2 Cooler, no tools needed.</td>
