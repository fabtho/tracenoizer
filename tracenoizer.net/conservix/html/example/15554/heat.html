 For a pavement, the concrete thickness is considered to be 0. 2 m thick layer of soil (subbase) immediately beneath it. 9 mm) is such that their contribution to heat transfer should be minimal. For the bridge decks, it is further assumed that the convection coefficient for heat transfer is the same for both the top and bottom surfaces, and that no heat transfer by radiation (incoming sunlight or emitted radiation) occurs at the bottom surface. For the pavements, it is further assumed that at a depth of 0.</td>

 We made collectors for the hot side of the 37W and 52W peltiers out of copper and silver. . Our goal was to be able to do this outside of a computer system with a more stable environment and heat source than a CPU. This project was inspired by Ian, at 2CoolTek who was one of the first to develop a Test System outside of a computer. A 22-Watt peltier to test graphics and chipset coolers.</td>

 It is expected that with the NCS installed on HST, NICMOS's operational life will be extended by at least five years beyond SM3B. When installed in the HST, gas will be circulated in this loop between the cooling system and the inside of the NICMOS cryostat. This carries heat away from the cryostat and keeps the detectors at their operating temperature (73 Kelvin or -200 C). For the HOST mission, the NICMOS cryostat was replaced by a simulator that contains an exact replica of the plumbing and interfaces in the NICMOS. This device is called the NICMOS Cooling Loop Simulator (NCLS).</td>
