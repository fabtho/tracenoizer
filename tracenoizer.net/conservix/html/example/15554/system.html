With a flooded system you eliminate the head pressure from distances ADWL - only frictional losses need to be considered, which is ideal for multi-level applications and installations well above the water line, such as large ships and oil rigs. You can eliminate the heat exchanger and raw water pump depicted below by using a keel cooler - our staff will assist you in deciding what system best suits your needs. Cooling with fresh water eliminates the sinking hazard and corrosion that sea raw water brings, and the basically room temperature cooling water of these systems eliminates the need to insulate the water lines, greatly reducing your installation expense in labor and material.">

 We made collectors for the hot side of the 37W and 52W peltiers out of copper and silver. . Our goal was to be able to do this outside of a computer system with a more stable environment and heat source than a CPU. This project was inspired by Ian, at 2CoolTek who was one of the first to develop a Test System outside of a computer. A 22-Watt peltier to test graphics and chipset coolers.</td>

 . Our water cooler allows you to overclock just about any and every AMD Athlon or Duron processor to full capacity. By following our step-by-step instructions, anybody can build this system on their own. The best model, the Swiftech MC462, which comes equipped with a solid copper heat sink, achieved a temperature of 30 degrees when used on an Athlon 1000. The majority of the coolers we tested lowered processor temperature down to 40 to 45 degrees, whereas the worst cooler only reached 56 degrees.</td>
