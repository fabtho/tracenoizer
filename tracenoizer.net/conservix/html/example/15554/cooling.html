 Industry Reports Click Here for news done right, AnandTech-style. But how do you cool Athlon MP processors in a case that's less than 2" tall. Read on as our resident cooling expert, Tillmann Steinbrecher puts all of the latest coolers through their paces and makes predictions for the future of socketed CPU cooling. The quest for more efficient cooling techniques has lead companies to experiment with everything from conventional air cooling to refrigeration. SENFU International Information Corp, a small Taiwanese company feels that water cooling is a potential solution to the problem.</td>

 In the background, it collects and monitors critical NCS telemetry as well as general housekeeping telemetry, and relays commands to the NCS subsystems. . HST Project Science Office - NICMOS Cooling System NICMOS Cooling System The HOST mission on board Space Shuttle Discovery, STS-95, has demonstrated the zero-gravity operation of the reverse turbo-Brayton cycle cryocooler in the NCS. As a result of this successful demonstration, this system will be used to cool the NICMOS instrument after SM3B (2000). These cryogenic coolers allow longer operational lifetimes than is presently possible with expendable cryogenic systems.</td>
