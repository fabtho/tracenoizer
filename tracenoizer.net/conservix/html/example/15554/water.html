 Cooling with fresh water eliminates the sinking hazard and corrosion that sea raw water brings, and the basically room temperature cooling water of these systems eliminates the need to insulate the water lines, greatly reducing your installation expense in labor and material. . Now you can benefit from the numerous advantages of self-contained systems without pumping sea water throughout your vessel. With a flooded system you eliminate the head pressure from distances ADWL - only frictional losses need to be considered, which is ideal for multi-level applications and installations well above the water line, such as large ships and oil rigs. You can eliminate the heat exchanger and raw water pump depicted below by using a keel cooler - our staff will assist you in deciding what system best suits your needs.</td>

 . Many thermal pollution problems are a result of anthropogenic activities (see "sources"). However, some water quality problems occur because of natural temperature fluctuations. The following information is provided to explain why temperature affects water quality and how anthropogenic activities may enhance the negative effects of natural temperature changes. First, water possesses many important thermal qualities.</td>
