 .com, a TechTarget site for Networking professionals. com homepage local area network A local area network (LAN) is a group of computers and associated devices that share a common communications line and typically share the resources of a single processor or server within a small geographic area (for example, within an office building). Usually, the server has applications and data storage that are shared in common by multiple computer users. A local area network may serve as few as two or three users (for example, in a home network) or many as thousands of users (for example, in an FDDI network).</td>

 . Special thanks to Cisco for their support in creating this article. If you have read other How Stuff Works articles on networking or the Internet, then you know that a typical network consists of nodes (computers), a connecting medium (wired or wireless) and specialized network equipment like routers or hubs. In the case of the Internet, all of these pieces work together to allow your computer to send information to another computer that could be on the other side of the world. They make it possible for several users to send information over a network at the same time without slowing each other down.</td>
