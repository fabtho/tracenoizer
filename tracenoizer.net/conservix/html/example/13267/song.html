 As a sidenote, it seems that the picturization of these songs will be excellent and will in turn, boost the popularity of the songs (namely Sailaru Sailaru and Apun Bola). Sailaru Sailaru, one of the most catchiest songs out right now, is rendered by the unusual but infectious voices of Suresh Peter and Mano. Sandeep Chowta) that takes a little getting used to, but the song is well-sung. This is one song that people will either hate or love. those who prefer more of the traditional voices of Udit and Kumar Sanu may find the song a little hard to get used to.</td>
