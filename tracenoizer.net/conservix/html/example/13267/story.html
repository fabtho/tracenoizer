 That's the charm and near brilliance of Rouse; he manages to take what could be, on cursory listen, pure cheese and endow it with a soft spoken and understated cool. Rouse opened with a trio of songs from his latest Ryko release, Under Cold Blue Stars, a concept album about a farm couple in the south that reaffirmed his deftness with straddling the line between credibility and middle American sentimentality. On his third album, Rouse has gained a quiet confidence that helps sell the story. And his closer, "Suburban Sweetheart," showed he hasn't grown too far beyond the accidental naivete that made him so endearing from the get go.
