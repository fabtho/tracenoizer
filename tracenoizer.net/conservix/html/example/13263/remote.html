In particular, the treatment of different image data sets in multiple combinations with optimum degree of geometric accuracy is required for the exact geographic location of individual ground features, especially in mountainous regions. Moreover, multisensor remote sensing data have to be made available to be used in geographic information systems or environmental monitoring systems. Hence, based on many years of research in the field of remote sensing, the Institute for Digital Image Processing of JOANNEUM RESEARCH has developed RSG - the Remote Sensing software package Graz. The RSG software package is designed as comprehensive and versatile as possible for geometric processing and quality assessment of digital multisensor remote sensing data.">

 A community dialogue is the first step in identifying issues and opportunities within a community that can ultimately lead to a higher quality of life. Agricultural Rural Minority Language Community Planning Initiative - AAFC and the Department of Canadian Heritage (DCH) have developed an Initiative to support agricultural rural minority language communities across the country in the production of community development plans. Checklist of Rural Lens Considerations - The Rural Lens raises awareness of rural and remote issues across federal government organizations by asking them to assess the effect of new policies, programs and services on Canadians living in rural and remote areas. Outlines the progress accomplished on each of the 54 "next steps" contained in the Rural Action Plan. Rural Youth Forum Dialogue - Live Chat with Andy Mitchell - Transcript What's New on the Site Community Dialogue Toolkit - A community dialogue is the first step in identifying issues and opportunities within a community that can ultimately lead to a higher quality of life.</td>
