The code is a slight modification of the code I wrote to create NT services using either the Microsoft unsupported OCX or pure VB code. As part of the article, I included code to create your own Service Control Manager (SCM). The included code is a simplified version of that SCM, which allows you to select any NT computer on your domain and look for a single service installed on that computer. It is not designed to look under any domain but the current one.</td>
