 For example, describing the demise of their online accounting system, Microsoft VP Satya Nadella was quoted on News. most users prefered to have their accounting data on their desktop rather than have it hosted off-site. The assumption you hear is often that a service will keep all the data created by the user, available whenever they need it from any browser, freeing them from the shackles of their personal computer. Better yet, they will be locked in, and will pay for the service for years to come. A service is something that is performed for you, it is not a tangible thing you are left with afterwards, though it may result in such a thing.</td>
