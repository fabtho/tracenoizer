In addition to the consumer market changes, the shrinking cost of silicon has practically eliminated the cost barriers that previously existed with 32-bit microprocessor technology. In response to these changes, the complexity, diversity, and sophistication of application development has increased considerably.

 Quick links to the WRSRL's CHASM site and the dedicated CHASM site at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne. . As a pioneer of new research directions, the WRSRL addresses these issues by bringing innovative science to bear on the development of numerical modelling and decision support systems relevant to a spectrum of environmental concerns. Advanced modelling technologies, incorporating the latest developments in process research and hydroinformatics, provide the basis for the WRSRL's current research agenda.
