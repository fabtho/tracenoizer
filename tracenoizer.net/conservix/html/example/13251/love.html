 The yodeling on some songs, combined with catchy pop hooks and an undeniable Afro-Celt folk funk is infectious. . As good as her records are, and they are wonderful, Laura Love is even better live. To emphasize the meaning of "Mahbootay," for example, Love playfully sticks her ample derriere out this way and that as she declares how "I feed it. feed it peanut butter (chunky)," clothes it and takes it with her everywhere she goes.</td>

 they are misinformed and may not know the whole story. how things affect the readers is up to them, everything that is produced, printed, or consumed will need a disclaimer - "don't be stupid. the new wave of electronic beats, drummers, and pro tools has taken a negative effect on the bands i love. the problem with enjoying unique bands is that they drastically change with each album. egomaniacs like thom yorke (radiohead) and billy corgan (smashing pumpkins) will let thier music suffer, so long as we label them 'creative' or 'doing something new'.</td>
