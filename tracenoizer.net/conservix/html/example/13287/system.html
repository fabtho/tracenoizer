 Access to information for making informed decisions, however, has been a limiting factor, both in terms of availability and understanding. A new, innovative water quality monitoring technology holds promise for delivering real-time information to the public. The Remote Underwater Sampling System (RUSS), a mobile underwater sensor package tethered to a platform containing an on-board computer, solar panels and telemetry equipment, transmits data on a suite of water quality variables to a land based computer in real time. Concurrent with the development of this sensor technology has been a National Science Foundation-funded education initiative to provide college and high school students with skills needed to resolve today's environmental problems. Near-real time data profiles on lake temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration, conductivity, turbidity and pH will be transmitted to an Internet-linked base station.</td>
