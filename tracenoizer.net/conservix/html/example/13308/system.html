 Their role in the body is analogous to that of computer security systems in computing. Although there are many differences between living organisms and computer systems, we believe that the similarities are compelling and could point the way to improved computer security. Four examples of how we are applying ideas from immunology to today's computer security problems are a host based intrusion-detection method, a network based intrusion-detection system, a distributable change-detection algorithm, and a method for intentionally introducing diversity to reduce vulnerability. The analogy with immunology contributes an important point of view about how to achieve computer security, one that can potentially lead to systems built with quite different sets of assumptions, biases, and organizing principles than in the past. Immunologists have traditionally described the problem solved by the immune system as the problem of distinguishing "self" from dangerous "other" (or "nonself") and eliminating dangerous nonself.</td>
