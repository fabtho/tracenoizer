<li><strong>You are most likely getting this page because I changed the name of a midi file.<BR><BR>

<li><strong>When webmasters create background music for their site they must not link to the midis here.  They must copy the midi file to THEIR server.<BR><BR>

I pay for a limited number of "hits" to my site and each time someone runs a midi file from here as background music on their page - it counts against MY bandwidth.  At least three times a week my site shuts down because it has hit the traffic limit - at times there have been over 800 hits PER DAY from sites who are doing this.<BR><BR>
The problem is getting worse.  I now rename all of the midi file directories periodically.  I am spending more time changing the names of midi files than updating the pages. If this continues I will shut down to revamp the site to make this maintenance easier.</strong>
