 Developed several new programs as part of initial design and installation, and remained responsible for them during my assignment to the project. Greatest accomplishment on this project was to re-engineer a program under a tight deadline by employing table-driven parameters. 1994 - 1997 Programmer, LSS System Supported a calling card revenue exchange agreement between the long- distance company and individual local telephone companies. Greatest accomplishment on this project was that I wrote Bernie Edit, an ISPF-like editor in C as an alternative to vi. 1990 - 1994 Programmer Analyst, WINNERS System Maintained and ran production of a revenue tracking and compensation system.</td>

 Without a solid software design, it's nearly impossible to achieve good performance through optimizations alone. These mirror the phases of the traditional OOSD model, with one addition. This new phase is performance profiling-determining the performance characteristics of a software system. As we discuss each phase, we'll introduce some additional performance-related tasks that are critical to producing high-performance software. These complement, rather than replace, those required by the OOSD methodologies.</td>

 . Innovate high-performance process for dry manufacturing of sheet metal armatures and their integrated on-line cleanliness examination INNOVATIVE HIGH-PERFORMANCE PROCESS FOR DRY MANUFACTURING OF SHEET METAL ARMATURES AND THEIR INTEGRATED ON-LINE CLEANLINESS EXAMINATION S. To guarantee the reliability of the magnet system characteristics for the complete lifespan of the product, it is necessary to integrate a remanence air gap into the magnet system. State-of-the-art technology for integrating the remanence air gap is either to grind the center pole of the magnet core or to fix a copper foil into the yoke of the armature or magnet core. Both methods lead to high production costs and tolerance problems.</td>
