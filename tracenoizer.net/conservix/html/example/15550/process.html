 It is the contention of this paper that processes should provide the foundation of a performance management system. The resulting framework would incorporate balanced scorecard and strategic performance measurement concepts. Even more importantly, a process-based framework can integrate a wide range of other management initiatives such as ABC, six sigma and total quality control. Processes provide an excellent foundation for configuring a performance measurement system. A process that is in control delivers good performance.</td>
