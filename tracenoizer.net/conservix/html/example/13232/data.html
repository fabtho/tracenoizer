 finding your project on-line make it possible and my life is easyest now. org KR uses the TraceNoizer Clone Engine to clone the databodies of the participants of ART01 one of the largest art fairs in the world taking place annually in basel and then uses them in an installation which is show in basel simulaneously. In this installation, visitors can activate the databodies of several ART Basel -participants, while these data streams in turn trigger acoustic and optical signals, and thus provide a spatial experience. clone data is printed on stickers and dissiminated in basel during the ART01. .</td>

 The achievement of knowbotic research consists in the creation of a dialogue on the interaction between the actual, the virtual and the hypothetical. . Scientists translate natural phenomena and system effects into mathematical equations and data that reflect processes and effects taking place in the "reference nature. " Through electronic networking, this exterritorialized nature in its digital forms becomes generally accessible, even to non-scientific users; the result may be described as a "digitized telepresence of reference nature in a public data world. " The reconstructed nature existing in the computer medium seems to detach itself from its reference basis and is transformed into a Computer Aided Nature (CAN).</td>

 Lerner will have an exhibition of paintings at the National Arts club in Manhattan in March of 2002 as well. 0 of Cheang's "Locker Baby" project (2001-2002), which features three Net installations based on a fictional scenario set in the year 2030. Produced by the Dolly Polly Transgency (DPT) with genes extracted from deep sea pearls, the clone generation of Locker Babies are born out of Tokyo coin lockers and entrusted to retrieve our collective deposits of ME-motion data on the Net. The public is invited to utilize the 36 virtual lockers for data deposit and to play ball on the Net. Phantom Tales, which examines the violence and propaganda that permeated the storybooks of Mengbo's childhood, is the artist's first web-based project.</td>
