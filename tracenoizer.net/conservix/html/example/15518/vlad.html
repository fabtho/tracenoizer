 If you want to know more about Dracula and Vlad Tepes click here. . Because we are very interrested in Bram Stoker's "Dracula" novel, one of our reasons to go to Romania was to see the places were Vlad Tepes (the original Dracula) had lived. During our trip I made a few beautiful photographs of the Vlad Tepes castles and his birth-house and more pictures of the stunishing landscapes of Romania. Although the photographs are enjoyable at their own, it's more likable when you know what you see, so I placed them in my travel-story completed with some information about Vlad Tepes.</td>

 . We do know that he was the character that was the inspiration for Bram Stokers Novel "Dracula" being the very famous Count Dracula. The book then brought about the very vampires that are well known to this day and made Vlad the Impaler a famous character from history. Vlad the Impaler -Tepes (pronounced tzse-pesh) was born in the town of Sighisoara in Transylvania (now known as northern Romania) in 1431 and later ruled the area of Southern Romania known as Wallachia. His father was Vlad Dracul who was a knight in the Order of the Dragon which was a union of central and Eastern European rulers who were a tad worried about the rising Ottoman empire.</td>
