 As a former English major with a strong interest in folklore- I really enjoyed the links to legend as well presentation of the man who is regarded as hero by even modern day Romanians (per Dr Florescu)- Was this review helpful to you. I found the book both educational and entertaining. Whether you are interested in the history of Dracula, or are just looking for a good book, I cannot recommend this one highly enough. This is an impressive piece of historical fiction - well researched and well told. While Vlad Dracula is certainly a famous, or infamous, historical figure, not a lot has been written about his world.</td>
