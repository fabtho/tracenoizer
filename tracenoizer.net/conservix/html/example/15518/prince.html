 The Transylvanian Society of Dracula has long been aware of the frantic search of the meaning of the vampire on the part of the western researchers whose folkloric roots were cut by industrialization and post-industrialization, by Cartesian upbringing. .

The sad thing about Prince Vlad Dracula is that no one knows where he was buried.</td>
