 You may want to print this page as you will need these directions after downloading the files. If the disks are not blank, then the install cannot be created properly. On the computer that is used for the download, be sure to note what directory you are downloading to. Follow this procedure for all disks using each file name (disk2. After following the above instructions, you will have a full set of install floppy disks.</td>

 These techniques are rooted in theories and research regarding human perception and the cognitive processing of visual information. The visual cues that enable humans to perceive depth have been extensively documented. Geoffrey Hubona describes several human-computer interaction experiments that examine the influence of various computer-generated depth cues, singularly and in combination, on performance in prototypical spatial tasks. These tasks involve object recognition, positioning, and resizing objects in space that are presented to users on a computer screen. The results are discussed within the context of cue theory and with respect to the ramifications for the design of practical 3D user interfaces in modern software applications.</td>

Computer Mediated Communication Telematic Applications Computer Mediated Communication Mediated Communications In many distance education contexts, students can be separated from their teachers and peer groups for long periods of time, and they can experience feelings of isolation. Although students cannot meet face to face, the use of computer based communication, can if used effectively, offset some of the more negative aspects of studying alone. Computer mediation of communications (CMC) can be achieved by the use of networked computers.</td>
