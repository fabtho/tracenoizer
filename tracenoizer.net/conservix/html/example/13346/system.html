 Links to simulation software developers Here you can find links to developers who make software for system dynamics modelling. . MIT System Dynamics in Education Project (SDEP) learn system dynamics, and you could be driving this. edu, Tuesday, April 30, 2002 system dynamics System dynamics is a method for studying the world around us. It deals with understanding how complex systems change over time.</td>

In fact it has been used to address practically every sort of feedback system. While the word system has been applied to all sorts of situations, feedback is the differentiating descriptor here. Feedback refers to the situation of X affecting Y and Y in turn affecting X perhaps through a chain of causes and effects.</td>
