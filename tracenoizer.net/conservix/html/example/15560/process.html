 Because we work the business process design industry all the time, we know the right questions to ask, and we use the power of the Internet. . We turn business process design obstacles into profit keys every day. We provide business process documentation and business process reengineering over the Web, an alternative to traditional business process consulting. We outperform the competition in business process design, and at a much lower delivered cost.</td>

 Some are involved in pushing the scientific frontiers to form a newer body of science and its practice for large-scale systems. . Tonight is an appropriate time to ponder about The Society for Design and Process Science. The conference brings together a number of distinguished scientists, engineers, managers from academia, government and business involved in the exploration and utilization of integrated design and process methodologies and techniques applicable to real-world problems. Some are involved in pushing the scientific frontiers to form a newer body of science and its practice for large-scale systems.</td>
