 Gundelsheim is famous for its Sauerkraut and its Transylvanian Saxon Museum. . For most people, Transylvania is a stereotype, a fictional place to air dark attitudes, an alleged place of horror. Transylvania is also a real place where you can spend hours at a time (even at night) without seeing a vampire or a werewolf. Just as Pennsylvania means "Penn's Woods" and Sylvania means a kind of lightbulb that burns out fairly quickly, Transylvania means literally "through the woods" or "beyond the woods," and that is a good description for where it is located.</td>

 Through his mother, Isabel (daughter of Sigismund I of Poland), he was related to the Jagiello dynasty. As an infant, he was crowned king of Hungary on his father's death (1540). John and Isabel received the principality of Transylvania under Ottoman suzerainty, but actual power was held by John's guardian, the monk George Martinuzzi, who sought to restore a unified Hungary. In 1551, Martinuzzi procured the deposition of John and Isabel and reunited Transylvania with Hungary, recognizing Ferdinand of Austria and Bohemia (later Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand I) as king. Martinuzzi, made prince-primate and a cardinal, soon fell out with Ferdinand, who had him assassinated.</td>
