Vlad the Impaler is estimated to have killed or ordered the execution of between 40,000 and 100,000 individuals. Vlad had stayed in the safe haven of Sibiu, Transylvania for awhile.">

 Caught between his new alliance and Christian loyalties, Dracul only sent a small force to help the Hungarians who were soundly defeated. Following the defeat John Hunyadi, the governor of Hungary led an attack against Dracul and another of his sons, Mircea at Tirgoviste. Dracul was killed and Mircea was tortured, then killed. With his death, not only did Vlad's imprisonment end, but he was also the rightful successor to the thrown. Hunyadi, however, installed his own puppet-prince, Vladislav II to thrown.</td>

 With the help of several hundred noble families captured in his realm, who had to work as simple slaves, he got his stronghold build high up in the mountains, close to the northern Wallachian town of Tirgoviste. First he revenged his fathers death, then he got rid of all his enemies in a boundless carnage. Several thousand people was killed in Wallachia and the neighboring countries. But prince Dracula didn't just kill people, he liked to see them suffer. His favorite method of torturing someone to death, was impalement.</td>
