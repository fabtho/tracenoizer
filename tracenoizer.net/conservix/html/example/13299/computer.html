 This natural evolution since 1977 meant that the sponsors of the NISSC could now move forward with new efforts to meet their mission objectives while ensuring that their customers' needs for broad ranging security conferences could be more than adequately met by other efforts. . Throughout its lifetime, the Conference - known first as the National Computer Security Conference (NCSC) - brought together information systems security and technology professionals from industry, academia, and government. It provoked debate, dialogue, and action on the major information systems security issues of the day. The NISSC educated the IT and IT security communities on major information systems security issues and solutions.</td>
