<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" " but the 1990 How to Live in the German Federal Republic, shot at job-training classes of various types, marshals plenty of evidence to the contrary. Opening with a hospitalized woman proudly declaring her commitment to the resistance and asserting "We don't want a dictator," the film closes with images of Ceausescu's corpse taken after his execution less than two weeks later. Rather than making a straightforward documentary, Farocki and codirector Andrej Ujica have opted for a reflexive approach that pays as much attention to formal concerns as to the political changes themselves. Watching these films consecutively reveals that Farocki can't match the consistency of Marker or Resnais, but even if his experiments sometimes fail, Images of the World makes an excellent case for his inquisitive brand of filmmaking.

 She reshot the film frame by frame, in English instead of German and in color instead of in black-and-white. Godmilow shot Inextinguishable Fire at the University of Notre Dame, where she is a professor in the Department of Film and Television. She recreated its austere dialogue and newsreel footage, its setting at a generic Dow Chemical lab, and the intertitles by which Farocki offered political commentary. She even superimposed Inextinguishable Fire's original footage over her own, archiving Farocki's film within her own work. Then you will close your eyes to the connections between them.</td>
