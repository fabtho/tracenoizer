His films require effort, an effort which produces unique intellectual and aesthetic pleasure . are Inextinguishable Fire, Images of the World and the Inscription of War, How to Live in the Federal Republic of Germany, and Videogramme of a Revolution. For his film Inextinguishable Fire, Farocki developed strategies that avoided almost all traditional forms of representation, in order to have us really "see" napalm for what it is. He refused both the pornography of "the real"-that which traditionally excites us in documentary, and the pedigree of "the real"-that which traditionally validates the text as true.</td>

It employs images and techniques used by the early Soviet montagists, especially Sergei Eisenstein's Oktyabr' (October, 1927), a depiction of the opening bracket of the pair - the Russian Revolution. Crowds are seen from above scattering under gunfire; revolutionary leaders seize the platform at popular manifestations, and major moments in the story are presented from multiple perspectives. Moreover, like Oktyabr', Videograms presents a popular revolution that took place over ten days.</td>
