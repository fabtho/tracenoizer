<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" The selections in American Life reveal a variety of regional American values and identities and how they are evolving over time. These artists explore a rich array of American characters, from the oldest known living African-American lesbian to a Southern mother and daughter prying into their own family secrets, from the odd goings-on in a small Tennessee town to the graceful motions of an ordinary suburban lawn sprinkler. Re-Thinking Documentary includes works that recast the documentary genre, thereby turning the documentary's gaze on itself. Jill Godmilow remakes a 1969 German documentary by Harun Farocki about Dow Chemical's development of napalm-B during the Vietnam War, this time in color and in English. By condensing Alfred Hitchcock's 1945 film Spellbound from 111 minutes to just under eight minutes, LeVeque transforms Hitchcock's trademark slow-paced suspense-building into a rushing sense of the inevitable.">

 via Godmilow's short "What Farocki Taught" than for the four documentaries just released on video by Facets. The latter is meant to bear out the former's provocative contention that the 17th-century Dutch still life, by turning from religious subjects to fetishizing quotidian objects, paved the way for modern consumerism. Unfortunately, the lecture feels stiff and uncinematic, and the documentary material rambling. " but the 1990 How to Live in the German Federal Republic, shot at job-training classes of various types, marshals plenty of evidence to the contrary. Opening with a hospitalized woman proudly declaring her commitment to the resistance and asserting "We don't want a dictator," the film closes with images of Ceausescu's corpse taken after his execution less than two weeks later.</td>
