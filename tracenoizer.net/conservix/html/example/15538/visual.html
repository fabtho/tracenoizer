 However, regardless of the Windows port, many Perl programmers don't hesitate to voice their preference for text-based editors (like vi and emacs) over Windows-based integrated development environments (IDEs). Some Perl gurus find text-based editors the most efficient way to code. But for programmers who are new to Perl, and programmers who primarily work in graphical environments such as Windows, the intuitive, visual nature of IDEs help them to learn languages and produce code more quickly. ActiveState's combined expertise in Perl and the Windows platform, and our stated goal of bringing open-source programming languages to a wider developer audience, has led to our interest in developing IDEs. NET required extending Visual Studio to provide Perl-specific functionality.</td>

 This photo gallery provides a sampling of the highlights of Greater Manhattan, from the George Washington Bridge in the north to Ellis Island in the south. Although located in the Bronx, what sampling of New York City would be complete without an image of Yankee Stadium. Photos by Eileen Barroso (Jan 09, 2002) Visual Arts Students Display Their Work During Open Studio Event On Dec. 15, 46 MFA candidates in the Visual Arts Division of Columbia's Graduate School of the Arts opened their studios to the public. During this event, artists were on hand to greet visitors and discuss their work in an informal setting, providing the kind of contact and exchange rarely found in a gallery setting.</td>
