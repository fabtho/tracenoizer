 It was created by the government of the socialist Francisco Largo Caballero on November 4, 1936, just two days before the central government left Madrid for Valencia. The ministry ceased to exist on May 17, 1937, when it was integrated into the Ministry of State. These dates provide the time frame for the design and publication of this poster. The artist who designed this image was Juan Antonio Morales (1909-1984), one of a handful of important Spanish painters who participated in the design of propaganda posters during the war. Morales also fought in the war as a soldier and was active as an book illustrator.</td>
