 .5MW Adiabatic Dry Coolershave recently been installed in Hemel Hempstead and Bristol for telecommunications company 186K Limited. They provide cooling water to the absorption chillers serving the Combined Cooling and Power system designed and installed by Brotherhood Aircogen in partnership with Lattice Energy Services. The coolers operate dry through most of the year and only change to adiabatic mode during times of high ambient and maximum cooling load. The Adiabatic Dry Coolers are fully automatic and have the benefit of POWETRONIC fan speed control which gives accurate temperature control and reduced noise levels.</td>

 For more information on our engineering services, click here. . Two types of Power Coolers are available, suited for cooling at different temperatures. Based on the one-stage Stirling Cryogenerator, the Liquid Power Cooler (LPC) pumps liquid gas as coolant in a closed loop through the application. In this loop the pressurized liquid gas is subcooled and kept below its boiling point.</td>

 . The two Innovatek kits, however, proved to be considerably better designed than the massive Swiftech models. Innovatek's kits also took the gold in terms of cooling capacity. Swiftech For real gung-ho overclockers, the only CPU cooling system even worth considering is a powerful water cooler. These overclocking fanatics usually remain far removed from the madding crowd of fans of the low-grade, conventional coolers on the market.</td>
