 All Water System ID numbers are nine characters in length, with the first two digits usually composed of the state abbreviation. . Safe Drinking Water Query Form Safe Drinking Water Query Form Search the SDWIS Database The Safe Drinking Water Information System (SDWIS) contains information about public water systems and their violations of EPA's drinking water regulations, as reported to EPA by the states. These regulations establish maximum contaminant levels, treatment techniques, and monitoring and reporting requirements to ensure that water systems provide safe water to their customers. This query will help you to find your drinking water supplier and view its violations and enforcement history since 1993.</td>

 Cooling with fresh water eliminates the sinking hazard and corrosion that sea raw water brings, and the basically room temperature cooling water of these systems eliminates the need to insulate the water lines, greatly reducing your installation expense in labor and material. . Now you can benefit from the numerous advantages of self-contained systems without pumping sea water throughout your vessel. With a flooded system you eliminate the head pressure from distances ADWL - only frictional losses need to be considered, which is ideal for multi-level applications and installations well above the water line, such as large ships and oil rigs. You can eliminate the heat exchanger and raw water pump depicted below by using a keel cooler - our staff will assist you in deciding what system best suits your needs.</td>
