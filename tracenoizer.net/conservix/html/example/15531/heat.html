 CMC (Copper-Molybdenum-Copper) has a much better thermal conductivity than CIC (Copper-Invar-Copper). . The classical way is to bond a heat sink on the component side of the board. The other two solutions are a central core or metal sheets laminated into the board. The core could be made out of a variety of materials like Carbon fibers, Polyimide or copper planes.</td>

 This publication provides some common sense suggestions and low-cost retrofit options to help you "keep your cool"- and save electricity. Passive cooling uses non-mechanical methods to maintain a comfortable indoor temperature. The most effective method to cool your home is to keep the heat from building up in the first place. , gain) is sunlight absorbed by your house through the roof, walls, and windows. Secondary sources are heat-generating appliances in the home and air leakage.</td>
