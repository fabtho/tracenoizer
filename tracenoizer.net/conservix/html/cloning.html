        <span class="normal">TraceNoizer finds data on the Internet that is connected 
        to a particular name, nickname and/or email address and continuously merges 
        that data into a potentially infinite number of minimally differing clones 
        which manifest in the form of homepages. These homepages are automatically 
        uploaded on servers offering free webspace and are therefore publicly 
        accessible to surfers and search-engine indexing-robots.<br>
        <br>
        </span> <b class="bold" ><span class="normalbold">Processing 
        the Clone</span> </b><br>
        <span class="normal">The first search and analysis that TraceNoizer performs 
        on a name yields a certain number of keywords. For each keyword (we will 
        now call them "theme") an HTML-site is automatically generated and linked 
        to all the other theme-pages which all contain text and images. Additionally, 
        TraceNoizer produces an index.html containing a welcome phrase and the 
        site structure.The TraceNoizer -system then periodically starts new queries 
        with the themes of the last search as searchterms, evaluates new themes 
        out of the search result and again publishes them as a new clone-page. 
        The thus created clones bear different stages of resemblance to their 
        original, the more are created the less likeness they bear to the original 
        databody. The url of each clone-page is also automatically submitted to 
        search-engines.This initiates the constant processing and reprocessing 
        of the clone-pages. The search-engines also refer people searching for an 
        email, name or nickname to those pages, where the really relevant data 
        is extremely hard to pinpoint among and within all the redundancies that 
        were created. <br>
        </span><span class="small"><br>With this cloning procedure, the Databody is 
        being developed and influenced in the following way:</span><br>

        <div align="center">1.<img src="../images/db_1.gif" width="500" height="133" border="0" align="absmiddle"></div>
        <br>
        <span class="small">1. The DataBody is slowly adulterated with disinformation 
        which is thematically related to each other.<br>
        <br>
        If TraceNoizer would handle the procedure differently, the result could	
        turn out as follows:</span><br>
        <br>
        <div align="center"> 2.<img src="../images/db_2.gif" width="500" height="133" border="0" align="absmiddle"><br>
          <br>
          3.<img src="../images/db_3.gif" width="500" height="133" border="0" align="absmiddle"><br>
        </div>
        <br>
        <span class="small">2. Randomized information are published. The "real" 
        Databody is still comprehensible, because the created false information 
        is not well directed.<br>
        3. Most of the clones are published at once. The disinformation could 
        mislead new searchers, if they don't notice the date, but would not trick 
        those, who observe the development.<br>
        </span><br>
        <span class="normal">It is necessary to emphasize, that the TraceNoizer-system 
        is a sophisticated and fully automated search-, analysis- and publication 
        tool, and that it produces homepages that come very close to personal 
        homepages produced by humans, of which there are a lot on the internet. 
        It is TraceNoizer's aim not fill free servers with trash but to confuse 
        and mislead in an intelligent way. </span></td>
