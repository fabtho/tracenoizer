        <span class="normal">Your Databody is the sum of the datatraces you ever 
        left on the Internet. <br>
        It is continuously beeing processd and reprocessed by the structures of 
        the net. Granted that a person manifests him-, her- or itself not in the 
        physical person itself but through how he, she or it is perceived by others, 
        one can say that there is no "real" or just one "true" person, but many 
        equally important ones which change according to how and by whom a person 
        is perceived. This train of thought is important in understanding databodies 
        because anyone searching for information on a person, be it an actual 
        human or an Internet search-bot (a machine) constructs that personality 
        out of the information they found.<br><br>
        On the Internet, personal information can easily be found for instance 
        upon entering a person's name, e-mail, nickname into search-engine. This 
        kind of encounter with that person is a construction, is being mediated 
        by the search-engine and does not take place in "real time". Old and new 
        , relevant and unrelevant information can often not be distinguished easily. 
        Upon searching for a certain person one might even encounter a mix of 
        multiple persons by the same name in a search result. <br><br>Search results also 
        vary according to which search-engine one uses and on how much information 
        there is on a person. Textual information can easily be copied out of 
        one context and pasted into another and that context might be indexed 
        by different search-engines which then present it to to someone querying 
        for a name in their own way. digitized personal (information is ever changing 
        as it is processed and reprocessed by search-engines and surfers, humans 
        and machines. <br>

        1. A person is active on the net.<br>
        2. They leave traces on the net. (such as postings, newsgroup mails, publications, 
        sign-up information, etc. )<br>
        3. These are processed by the net (cashed, deleted, copied, quoted, etc.) 
        This processed information is the DataBody.<br>

        <span class="normal"> Two important points are visualized in the infographic 
        above:<br>
        - The basis for the generation of a personality is the databody, whitch 
        is theoreticaly exacttly definable because it contains all the datatraces 
        that a person has left on the Internet. <br>
        - There is very little chance to exert influence over one's own databody 
        because it is being constructed by the structures and mechanisms of the 
        net. </span></td>
