        <span class="normal"> TraceNoizer is a webbased tool. In addition to the 
        mechanisms for the construction of clones discussed in "Cloning the Databody" 
        TraceNoizer also allows the targeted removal of any clone. This means 
        that the files that make up that clone are being deleted. But since pages 
        can be cached by search engines, the clone is not really "dead" or completely 
        removed from the Internet. <br>
        <br>
        So by "killing" a clone you do influence the databody because files cannot 
        be accessed anymore, but it is not possible to estimate exactly how this 
        influences the databody, since the databody is defined as a mass of data 
        that is constantly being processed and reprocessed by the net (as discussed 
        in the chapters above). <br>
