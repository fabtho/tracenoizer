 Successful collaboration with others typically requires that someone run a big reliable server (see Chapters 1 and 17 of Philip and Alex's Guide to Web Publishing). Thus the market for computing may in the end boil down to simple stuff to be used by consumers and reliable stuff to be operated by professional IT staff. Windows is way too complex for most consumers and difficult to justify on the server side when you can run Linux for free. By acquiring WebTV, a simple Internet appliance, they've got a toehold into the future of the desktop. By acquiring Hotmail they've got a toehold into the future of server-based applications.</td>
