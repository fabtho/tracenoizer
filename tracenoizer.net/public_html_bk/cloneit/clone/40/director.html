 Eckert often catches customers sneaking peeks at wallet vintage charts. The landmark Charlie Palmer restaurant, Aureole, has managed to stay atop the heap for more than a decade. Wine Director Ned Benedict has turned the list into a well-oiled machine, perfect with "Charlie food" like caramelized squab and foie gras, fingerling carrots and preserved apricots. Considering the stature of this restaurant, the wine prices are reasonable. From Teroldego to Chasselas, Benedict cherry-picks powerful wines.</td>
