 In conceiving this restaurant Jean-Georges wanted to bring back the elegance of tableside service to accompany his signature style of modern French cooking. After all, we cooks are the ones that have been having all the fun in the kitchen -- that first aromatic smell of freshly sliced meat or the placement of the perfect garnish to finish a dish will now be experienced by the guests. It will add a sense of aliveness and conviviality to the dining room that focuses on the food. The cuisine at Jean Georges is based on the deceivingly-simple philosophy of using the highest quality ingredients and preparing them in a way that allows their natural flavors to stand on their own. As a man in a constant quest to find and refine new flavors to pique his interest and our palates, Jean-Georges spents months of research and weeks of foraging Upstate New York, that he clearly defined his new palette of seasonings and accompaniments for his menu at Jean Georges -- wild edible plants.</td>

Kurt Eckert JEAN GEORGES One Central Park West New York, NY 10023 (212) 299-3900 I hesitate to use the term "cutting edge" when describing a dining room, but Jean Georges certainly fits the bill.
