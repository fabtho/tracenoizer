 Designer Adam Tihany has created a visually stunning space, with floor to ceiling windows overlooking Central Park and a soothing palette of taupe, ecru and silver. During the warmer months, you can enjoy outdoor dining and cocktails at the Mistral Terrace, with views of Central Park. In conceiving this restaurant Jean-Georges wanted to bring back the elegance of tableside service to accompany his signature style of modern French cooking. After all, we cooks are the ones that have been having all the fun in the kitchen -- that first aromatic smell of freshly sliced meat or the placement of the perfect garnish to finish a dish will now be experienced by the guests. It will add a sense of aliveness and conviviality to the dining room that focuses on the food.</td>

 I must say that it has been a dining year of some controversy for me. I believe that the quality of cuisine being prepared has never been more superb and creative. At the same time, the level of service and professionalism at tableside has never been more disappointing. This makes the following list of sommeliers and cellarmasters even more impressive in their commitment to excellence and customer appreciation. Let's hope that restaurateurs will discover the need for balance between the front and back of the house before the millennium.</td>
