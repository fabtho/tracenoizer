 He was walking to an event to promote his new book Nur Gehen (Only Walking), his version of experiences with nature. Up to his retirement in 1987, he had led more than 10,000 broadcasts featuring the music he loved. He not only wrote The Jazz Book, but in total 33 books, translated into 16 languages, dealing mostly with music and philosophy. In 1970 American-based music publication Jazz and Pop voted him Europe's best jazz producer. In The Jazz Book Berendt points out that it was the Swiss conductor Ernest Ansermet who wrote the first serious article on jazz, the Belgian Robert Goffin wrote the first book on jazz in 1929 and the first jazz review was published by the French Charles Delaunay at the end of the 1930s.</td>
