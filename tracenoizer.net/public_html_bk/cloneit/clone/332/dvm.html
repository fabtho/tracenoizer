 The weekend culminated with memorable CVM class dinners on Saturday evening. The youngest Reunion attendee we saw was the 8-week-old daughter of Drs. Fifty-nine percent of the DVM Class of 1950 returned for their 50th Reunion. The DVM class of 1990 had the greatest number of alumni return--25--and their class picture looks great. The DVM Class of 1975 won the Dean's Cup for the highest participation in the Annual Fund, with 42 percent participation as of Reunion weekend.</td>

 Understanding Breeding Management is a companion to Schweizer's earlier work in the Understanding series, Understanding the Broodmare. . Schweizer, DVM, Diplomate ACT This authoritative yet straightforward guide discusses the preparations required -- and the challenges -- of getting mares pregnant. Schweizer covers such topics as the mare's anatomy, the reproductive system, and the importance of teasing and veterinary monitoring. The Cornell University instructor also examines the different breeding methods, including artificial insemination.</td>
