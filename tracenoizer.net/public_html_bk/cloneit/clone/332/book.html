<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" Some books written by breeders can be very sanctimonious and patronizing towards newcomers over why and whether they should breed dogs. It leaves me with a feeling that their motives are not so much based on fact, but their fear of a little competition. I just felt this was altogether a trustworthy book of information. Careful and up to date information on every aspect of breeding makes this book a worthy addition to the breeder's bookshelf, and is equally valuable to the novice and veteran. Especially reassuring is Rice's detailed examination of when to and when not to call the vet.">

The book's opening remarks are that you should never trust a stallion. Whilst I can appreciate the author's own point of view on this matter, I have to disagree with it.
