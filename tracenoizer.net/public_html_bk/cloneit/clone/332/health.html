 Do not let your love for your dog make you blind to your obligation to others. Your dog may be healthy, but may still pass on serious genetic disease. Do not breed your dog if you have no information on the health and fitness of both the parents of your dog, and its prospective mate. You need more than a single generation to make a good decision. Research the pedigree for your dog (and any prospective mate).</td>

 I do not say that often or lightly, but this is one book every horse owner ought to have (and read) before the emergency happens. Ramey Here the author discusses injury to the navicular bone of the front foot and evaluates treatments that can be used to prevent lameness. Ramey Part of a series of single-topic paperbacks related to the health and maintenance of the horse. Colic is the catch-all term for illnesses in the horse, from a condition of only slight concern to one that is ultimately fatal to the horse. Ramey describes the various types of colic and the recommended course of treatment for each.</td>

 This is only an overview to give you an idea of what kinds of problems are out there. Remember that joint problems, even if not hereditary, may make it problematic for a bitch to be bred. Pregnancy is hard on the joints and on the body in general and if she isn't in the best of physical health, it is much kinder not to breed her. Puppies at risk should be BAER tested and any that fail should be neutered. Subaortic stenosis (SAS), other malformations of the heart or valves.</td>
