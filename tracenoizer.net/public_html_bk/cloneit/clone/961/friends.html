I know you have kept him in your prayers and I ask that you continue to do the same for his wife Carol and my sisters through this trying period in our life.

 Charles was also the organizer and promoter of one of the most popular regional taxidermy competitions, the Southern Regional Taxidermy Convention. No details on funeral arrangements are available at this time, but will be forthcoming. Our thoughts and prayers go out to Carol and her family, as well as all of Charles' friends and associates. His friends and family will be in our prayers and Charles will be missed terribly. For those who never had the chance to meet him- he was a wonderful and very colorful man and loved the taxidermy industry.</td>
