 I was married in 1962 to Harold Stanley Harves, at age 16, in Indpls. We were together for 33 years, until his death in 1995. I've done genealogy for over thirty years, and wanted to write a book on two families. Now I think I should just share what I have with others. There are a lot of files, and very little has been put on my sight, so please keep checking in.</td>

 Louis, said the vast majority of those deaths could have been prevented by appropriate care and planning. Strunk also has identified children who are most likely to die. These children live in families that, for various reasons, do not function or communicate well. Looking at published studies, he compared children who had died with children who had asthma just as severely but were still alive. His review of the studies appeared in a recent issue of the journal Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America.</td>
