<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" Clips from the two-part, hour-long historical documentary were shown at the NASW conference in Baltimore in November, and the premiere of the full video was held at CSWE's annual meeting in Dallas in March. The video tells the story of the birth and growth of professional social work against a backdrop of social change in American history during the past century. The fights for social justice, civil rights and programs for the poor are viewed through the lives and careers of some of social work's tenacious pioneers. Their stories tell of the values, struggles and achievements in creating and carrying out social work's missions. To no one's surprise, the documentary begins with the life of Jane Addams who established Hull House in Chicago, a settlement house, and Mary Richmond who wrote the first comprehensive statement of principles of direct social work practice.">
