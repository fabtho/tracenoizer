The former employs "original" performance practice, the latter a "modern" practice.">

 Current price and availability information can be given upon request. most collected editions which are currently published or reprinted in non-European countries (we have included a few titles from Israel and Japan). This special pricing is only offered when the standing order is placed for the COMPLETE SET. If it becomes necessary to cancel the standing order in the future, the publisher reserves the right to collect the difference between the reduced (or subscription) price and the general price for all volumes supplied prior to the cancellation of the standing order. When transferring an existing standing order to us, please indicate both, the date of the original order and the source from which the previous volumes were obtained, so that we may secure any original advantageous pricing that might apply to future volumes.</td>

 I will also continue to work on English glosses and to collaborate with my friends from Italy and elsewhere, in order to arrive at translations into languages other than English as well. Time permitting, I will also add an occasional commentary or article about the cantatas. Philip Ambrose, who was originally responsible for the translations of the complete cantatas as performed by Helmuth Rilling, has linked his pages to mine. So, in the near future you will have all German cantata texts (this site) together with their English translations at Ambrose's site. Needless to say, I am delighted about the world-wide cooperation possible now between all dedicated to the awesome legacy of the greatest musical genius of all time.</td>
