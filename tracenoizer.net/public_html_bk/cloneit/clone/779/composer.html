 History has proven that as originality in music lessened style and cliques gained importance. Originality was a low priority as the last millennium ended. Music should be an honest communication between composer and audience. The composer should shoot from the hip releasing honest emotion to the audience without getting bogged down with preconceptions or platforms. High brow, middle class, music has always taken its influences from folk or blues - the peoples music.</td>
