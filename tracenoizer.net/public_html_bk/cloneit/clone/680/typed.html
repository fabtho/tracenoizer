Now imagine how much easier programming would be if all variables could hold any object as easily as char variables hold any character, and that variables representing non-atomic data could contain elements of any type of data, in the same way that strings can contain any character. In Lisp, the data itself is (conceptually) typed by a tag. The variables which hold the data are not themselves required to be typed, and may hold any data (though the variables may also be typed if desired by the programmer). By examining the tag, each datum may have its type determined at run time, if necessary, by the program.</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="6"><td valign="center"></td><td valign="bottom"> _____________________________________________________________________________ Character Sets - - - P . _____________________________________________________________________________ Style Sheets - - - P . _____________________________________________________________________________ Typed Links P P P,I . _____________________________________________________________________________ Scripting - - - . 0, many browsers have implemented the design specifications and made them a defacto standard of the language if not the entire community of browsers.</td><tr></table><br>another typed site: <a href="http://www.info.com.ph/~cadi">http://www.info.com.ph/~cadi</a><br><br></font><font size=-6> <a class="nav" href="http://www.nektar.ch/klon/202/index.html">.</a><br><br></font></body></html>
