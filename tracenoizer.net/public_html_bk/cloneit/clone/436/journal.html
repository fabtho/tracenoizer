 Understanding and good communication are so very important to these issues, I can't stress enough how much difference it makes to be able to share them with another person. . Indigo's Peer Journal Exercises Indigo's Peer Journal Exercises While it may seem unlikely that you can truly heal without the care of a good therapist, it is possible- I'm living proof of that. I was one of the lucky ones, and I freely admit that as well. It turned out not to be necessary, in my case, to consult professional therapists.</td>

 A manuscript posted on a personal or institutional homepage or ftp site amounts to a preprint and will not be considered as published. We expect the practice of posting preprints to become nearly universal in ecology as it has become in physics, and it should not affect eligibility for consideration by our journals. If a manuscript is available as part of an electronic publication such as a journal, technical series, or some electronic entity to which a library can subscribe (especially if the publication has an ISSN or ISBN), we will consider that the manuscript has been published and is thus not eligible for consideration by our journal. A necessary but not sufficient test for prior publication is whether the manuscript has appeared in some entity with archival value so that it is permanently available to reasonably diligent scholars. Data from previous publications may be included in articles in our journal when necessary for completeness, with the editor's approval, if the sources of the data are clearly identified.</td>
