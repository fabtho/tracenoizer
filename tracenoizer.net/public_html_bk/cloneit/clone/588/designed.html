 . The Internet revolution will drive custom-manufactured products, where each customer gets exactly the unique product they want. The change to customer-designed products is based on the ability to connect the user interface to the manufacturing backend through a computer. As the product is manufactured, the computer knows what customer it is intended for, what that customer specified, and how to track the product through the manufacturing process so that it can be shipped directly to the desired destination. No inventory (one of the business benefits of custom manufacturing).</td>

 The design and photometric details of the new spotlight series are based on the experience acquired by ERCO in the lighting of the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao. Special lighting instruments for accent lighting in rooms with a height of up to 164 ft (50 m) were developed for the remarkable architecture of Gehry's building. The spotlight series designed by Franco Clivio is now capable of comparable performance. Among the special technical features of Stella spotlights is the option of locking all the movable parts into place - from the positioning of a sculpture lens to the fixing of angles of rotation and tilt. The specific settings of each spotlight can thus be preserved during maintenance work.</td>
