<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" Ruedi was in his youth an ardent Alpine climber and skier. He still retains his qualifications but nowadays confines his guiding to taking guests on organized mountain walks. It's refreshing to stay here at a traditional family hotel in a chic resort and experience old-style Swiss hospitality. Upstairs, you find reception, the bedrooms, and an eclectically decorated sitting room with old photos of the town on the walls alongside Ruedi's first hunting trophies. The pine-paneled bedrooms vary from light pine to mellow old pine.">
