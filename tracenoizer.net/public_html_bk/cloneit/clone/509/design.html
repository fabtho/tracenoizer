 Harasim, et al Explore similar items Editorial Reviews From the Back Cover This book provides the first coherent set of principles and frameworks for designing breakthrough educational multimedia. This book establishes a framework for educational multimedia that divides the development process into conceptual and presentation levels. Conceptual design proposes a new synthesis for unifying the scattered knowledge in this area, and creating a deep learning architecture. Presentation design deals with the realization of an educational multimedia offering, involving issues such as screen layout, color schemes and the detailed use of individual media. Well-illustrated examples help the reader understand all the critical issues of multimedia learning environment design, development and evaluation.</td>
