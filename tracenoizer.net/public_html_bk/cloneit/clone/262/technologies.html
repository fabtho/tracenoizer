 For the motivated student, the result is a rich and valuable learning experience. . University of Delaware By definition, distance learning substitutes communications technologies for personal contact between instructor andstudents. Problem-based learning (PBL) typically requires intensive instructor contact with students and may be difficult to implement in a distance learning context. However, our course demonstrates that multimedia technologies and extensive use of the World Wide Web can make PBL feasible for both traditional and distance students.</td>
