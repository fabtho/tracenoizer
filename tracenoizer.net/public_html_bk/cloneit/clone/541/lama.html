 . EDT (2109 GMT) From Beijing Bureau Chief Rebecca MacKinnon BEIJING (CNN) -- At the ripe age of 11, Gyancain Norbu finds himself at the center of a weighty theological and political dispute. The boy has recently returned from seclusion in Beijing to the land of his birth to claim his place in Tibetan society as a living god -- the reincarnation of the 10th Panchen Lama, Tibetan Buddhism's second-ranking religious leader. But many Tibetan exiles -- including their top religious leader, the Dalai Lama -- consider the boy to be a pawn of the Chinese authorities who took over Tibet in 1959. They say China is attempting to indoctrinate a new generation of Tibetan religious leaders through a puppet ruler.</td>
