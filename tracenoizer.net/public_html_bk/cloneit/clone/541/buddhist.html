 None of this is to take away from the very real oppression Tibetans face-but their leaders are certainly getting plenty of mileage out of that misery. Not only the powerful are attracted to Buddhists and Buddhism. According to Diana Eck, director of the Pluralism Project at Harvard University, adherents are packing out the nearly 1,500 Buddhist temples and monasteries that are to be found throughout the United States. Tens of thousands of students are influenced by the Buddhist Studies departments that have sprung up in most major American universities and colleges. In southern California, a Thai Buddhist temple is erected every two months.</td>
