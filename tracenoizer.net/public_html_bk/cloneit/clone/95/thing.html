 If you offend easily, then skidaddle on outta here. In the meantime, Kate and Lucas are having some of the best lines in their history of Days while they agonize over their failing loyalty with Victor and just what they will do when they end up behind bars. This whole key thing with Angela Macaroni is plain boring in my opinion. So, John and Hope discuss him being the father of Johnny. I must say that Nicole has improved ten-fold as an actress.</td>

 ) so what is ur beef u fornicatress Actually, I seriously don't care if you consider me sexy and evil because of this, or even trendy. And while you're at it get me a lemonade and grill me some burgers. The point is that ANYTHING you think holds great meaning, whether it's revered as genious or spat apon like garbage, it's a thing of beauty somewhere, because it lies on the same circle as anything else. but the beauty is, that when you belive that, you can belive whatever you want. The same is true with me, I guess, in all aspects of my life.</td>

 If a guy wanted to get back at someone, they'd go up to them and punch them in the face. Ooh, I hate her; let's see if we can mess up her head. My current topic was some stupid thing about peer pressure, and to alter it slightly to fit my 'bitch ratio' idea would be easy. A few questions, surveying the entire female population of the school. I was counting on a partner to help me with all the data and conclusions.</td>
