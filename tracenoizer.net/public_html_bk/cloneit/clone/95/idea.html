Thank Nicole, that was certain - she'd done the same for me. "I'd like to thank my partner Nicole, not only for agreeing to help me with my initially strange idea, but for all the work she did in gathering data and making the project what it was. " I turned slightly from my position, glancing back at Nicole, and she winked at me. My extreme thanks go to Amanda Gunn, for without her, I would not have the idea for my project, or Nicole as my partner.">

 I guess romantic symbolism has to be worth something, then. (Also, I need to give my fans some kind of consolation for taking off my spam background. For my old site-seers who enjoyed the idea of Mokona's hidden meaning, this takes the cake. I consider it less my own and more a tribute to obsessive pokemon haters. Dabble in my page of joy, where bunnies laugh and children dance.</td>

(27) Do you agree with the idea that sequels are always worse than the original. (29) What kind of movie do you think there should be more of. (30) What movie(s) do you simply not understand the appeal of.</td>

 If a guy wanted to get back at someone, they'd go up to them and punch them in the face. Ooh, I hate her; let's see if we can mess up her head. My current topic was some stupid thing about peer pressure, and to alter it slightly to fit my 'bitch ratio' idea would be easy. A few questions, surveying the entire female population of the school. I was counting on a partner to help me with all the data and conclusions.</td>
