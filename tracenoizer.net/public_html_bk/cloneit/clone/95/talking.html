 A few faint obscenities followed me until I turned off their road and headed back onto the highway. My knuckles were white from gripping the steering wheel so hard; I reluctantly relaxed up on it a bit.

 (37) How much do you actually care about the inner workings of your computer, as long as it works. (38) Do you ever begin preferring IMs to other forms of conversation. (39) Do you find you're different talking through IMs than face-to-face or on the telephone. (40) Have you ever ended bid on something on eBay and regretted it later. THE BATTLE OF THE SEXES (41) Have you ever wished you could experience being the other gender.</td>
