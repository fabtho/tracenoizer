 I think they're supposed to be pictures of Drewsmen playing rugby and other College games, but they're so atrocious I really can't say that with any authority. After we slurp down our soup, those sitting nearest the Long Table are charged with doling out portions of the main course to the rest of the table - this is doubly tragic on Lamb night, 'cause our knives are really dull. ) Sadly, Adrianne didn't visit on a Formal Dinner night; we were still technically on vacation so everything was pretty laid-back. After our jaunt in the cafeteria and a brief tour of where I live, Adrianne and I decided to hit Sydney's prime tourist spot, Darling Harbor. Adrianne marveled at the unparalleled skyline view as we wandered past, on our way to the IMAX theater.</td>

 She was a friend of mine - and I'd only talked with her a few days ago about Jeff. Did you see that hideous halter-top that Meagan was wearing yesterday. Meagan was very pretty - not fat at all - and I knew what shirt they were talking about. But why did they have to talk behind their backs like that. Hell, after Amanda's treatment of me - and those girls talking in the hall, I knew that girls were capable of more evil than guys ever could.</td>

 I gave her a sad smile, then turned back to the rest of the audience. Nicole's head stayed on my shoulder, though, and she didn't wake. I wonder how many girls know how pretty they look when they're sleeping. Smiling, I reached down and gently brushed back a lock of her hair, tucking it behind her ear. Her dilated pupils shrunk a little bit, and she nuzzled at the side of my neck.</td>
