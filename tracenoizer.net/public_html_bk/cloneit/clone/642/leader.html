 . Our struggle must remain non-violent and free of hatred. " -- Dalai Lama, Tibetan leader AS LEADER of the Tibetan people His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, leads a life of exile in India. After an uprising against Chinese rule 42 years ago, the Dalai Lama fled, followed by thousands of Tibetans. Over the decades the 66-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner and advocate of non-violence has continued to seek "genuine autonomy" for his homeland, a land that China considers to be an integral part of its territory.</td>

 Expounding China's stand on Tibet, Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan said here that Beijing was willing to negotiate with the Dalai Lama if he agreed to China's preconditions. "We have reiterated on many occasions that as long as the Dalai Lama truly renounces his proposition for Tibetan independence, stops all activities aimed at splitting the motherland and makes a public statement recognising Tibet as an inalienable part of China, we will welcome his return to the motherland," he said. Putting further preconditions, Tang said the Tibetan leader should recognise Taiwan as a province of China and the government representing the whole of China. So that he can do something useful for the people in Tibet in the rest of his life. " China has long accused Nobel laureate 64-year-old Dalai Lama of trying to split the country.</td>
