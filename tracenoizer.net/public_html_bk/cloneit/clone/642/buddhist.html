 Case studies show how these ancient cures work where modern ones have failed, even against paralysis and kidney failure. Testimonials from European biochemists underline the Dalai Lama's assertion that the subtle, holistic methods of Tibetan healing counterpoint the invasive but dramatic methods of Western medicine. The film is not overtly political, yet even the gentle tenets of Buddhist spirituality cannot hide the specter of Chinese tyranny. At one point, a Buddhist nun calmly describes her brutal rape and torture by prison guards. com Rate this Film If you don't want to vote on a film yet, and would like to know how others voted, leave the rating selection as "Vote Here" and then click the Cast Vote button.</td>

 None of this is to take away from the very real oppression Tibetans face-but their leaders are certainly getting plenty of mileage out of that misery. Not only the powerful are attracted to Buddhists and Buddhism. According to Diana Eck, director of the Pluralism Project at Harvard University, adherents are packing out the nearly 1,500 Buddhist temples and monasteries that are to be found throughout the United States. Tens of thousands of students are influenced by the Buddhist Studies departments that have sprung up in most major American universities and colleges. In southern California, a Thai Buddhist temple is erected every two months.</td>

 The government is still looking into the likely fallout should the Karmapa Lama continue to stay in India. While the government is likely to give the Karmapa Lama refugee status, which is provided to all Tibetans who flee Tibet to India, political asylum appears unlikely. Another option is to allow the Karmapa Lama seek asylum in another country, which could also be a Buddhist country where he is revered. Two names that have been mentioned are Japan and Thailand, but there is no confirmation of the same. The Karmapa Lama is the head of the Kagyu sect of the Buddhist faith.</td>
