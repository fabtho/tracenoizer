<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" All mutants were blocked in the formation of commitment complex 2 (CC2) at non-permissive and permissive temperature. The ts mutants showed no defect in formation of mature splicesomes and splicing in vitro. The cs mutant was partially defective in (pre)-spliceosome formation, but in vitro splicing activity could be detected. Interestingly, pre-mRNA leakage to the cytoplasm was strongly increased in the mutants (up to 40-fold compared to wild type). A combination of msl5 ts mutants with a disruption of UPF1, a gene involved in nonsense-mediated decay, resulted in a specific synthetic growth phenotype.">

 In our research we follow the hypothesis that during evolution mutations and selection have driven the metabolic systems toward states characterised by certain optimum properties. In extension to previous investigations on the evolutionary optimisation of the catalytic properties of individual enzymes (R. Kinetic parameters of enzymatic reactions in states of maximal activity. 56, 65-106) we focus now on the explanation of the stoichiometric design. On the basis of kinetic and thermodynamic principles conclusions are derived concerning the optimal network topology by studying a large number of alternative pathways.</td>

 The risk for persons with HIV -- especially if they are using other drugs which can suppress bone marrow, such as AZT -- is unknown. It is also possible that lower doses than used for leukemia might be enough for HIV treatment. Probably the first HIV trials will start with low doses and very careful monitoring of blood tests for side effects, and use a test for viral activity (such as the ICD p24 antigen test, for those who are positive on this test) as an indicator to show which dose is effective. (Even this indicator might be slow to respond, however, since the drug may only shut off viral reproduction, not other activity of the virus which already exists. ) AIDS TREATMENT NEWS would be interested in hearing from anyone who has information about possible AIDS-related uses of hydroxyurea.</td>
