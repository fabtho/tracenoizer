 Beyond this description, many aspects of the mechanism remain in question. . Using biophysical and molecular biological techniques, we are currently studying mechanisms of active electrogenic ion transport and muscle excitation-contraction coupling. Electrochemical gradients for ions are maintained across biological membranes by specialized active transport proteins, ion pumps. In spite of their central role in cell function, the molecular mechanisms by which these proteins transport ions across biological membranes are not known.</td>

 3, which is due to mutations within a novel gene named AIRE for autoimmune regulator. Isolation of all genes encoded by Chromosome 21, integration of transcriptional and physical maps, and large-scale genomic sequencing are expected to provide a complete gene catalogue and a descriptive view of the chromosomal organization. The chromosome 21 gene catalogue will allow systematic positional cloning and candidate gene approaches for identifying the molecular factors playing a role in HSA21-associated diseases. The DNA sequence and gene catalogue were published on May 18th 2000 in Nature by an international consortium of laboratories. Dataset are accessible at the MPIMG HSA21Db Database and at RIKEN.</td>
