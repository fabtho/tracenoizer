 After publication, the data will be transmitted to Cardiff for inclusion in the Human Gene Mutation Database. . Upon entry to the Mutation Data Submission Page, the user will be asked for their name, address and contact details. They may then select the type of mutation they wish to submit to Human Genetics Online i. Each page adopts a standard format to ascertain the disease designation, the identity of the gene involved and the extent and location of the mutation.</td>

 At least in 5 patients with CNGA3 mutations residual cone photoreceptor function associated with better visual function and clear color discrimination abilities was found, indicating that mutations in the CNGA3 gene do not necessarily cause RM. . Here we present the results of a screening for CNGA3 mutations in patients with RM and other types of cone photoreceptor dystrophies, which enables us to establish a first comprehensive mutation spectrum of the CNGA3 gene. In 6 cases only a single heterozygous mutation could be found. 10 of the mutations were observed recurrently in different families.</td>

 A total of 301 sequence variants including 278 bona fide pathogenic mutations were identified. As many as 216 of the genuine mutations, among them 179 different ones, can be considered novel when referring to the most recent review in the field (Upadhyaya and Cooper, 1998). Mutation detection efficiencies of the different screening methods were very similar to each other, 47. These mutations showed a very even distribution over the whole gene from exon 1 to exon 47. Thus, neither frequent deamination of 5-methylcytosines nor interchromosomal gene conversion may account for the high mutation rate of the NF1 gene.</td>
