<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" . We are currently studying mechanisms of active electrogenic ion transport and muscle excitation-contraction coupling using biophysical and molecular biological techniques. These experiments utilize patch-clamp techniques with single cardiac myocytes and HeLa cells expressing Na,K-ATPase enzymes that contain point mutations in membrane spanning regions of the protein. Our goal is to determine which amino acid residues of the Na,K-ATPase are responsible for ion coordination and voltage-dependent ion binding reactions and, in doing so, identify the changes in enzyme structure that underlie ion transport reaction steps. This project should allow us to pinpoint the molecular mechanism of ion transport by the Na,K-ATPase and will also serve as a guide for studying transport by other ion pumps.">

 . James The following are two of a number of treatment leads presented at the IX International Conference on AIDS, held in Berlin on June 6-11, 1993. This paper reported laboratory studies showing that topotecan inhibits HIV in chronically as well as acutely infected cells (which AZT, ddI, etc. do not do), and that it is effective at a concentration 200 times lower than that which has been tolerated by cancer patients -- suggesting that as an AIDS treatment the drug may have a large therapeutic range (between effective and toxic doses). The laboratory tests found that topotecan is more powerful than curcumin as an inhibitor of HIV.</td>

 James The following are two of a number of treatment leads presented at the IX International Conference on AIDS, held in Berlin on June 6-11, 1993. Topotecan Topotecan is a chemical now being tested in patients by SmithKline Beecham as a potential cancer treatment. This paper reported laboratory studies showing that topotecan inhibits HIV in chronically as well as acutely infected cells (which AZT, ddI, etc. do not do), and that it is effective at a concentration 200 times lower than that which has been tolerated by cancer patients -- suggesting that as an AIDS treatment the drug may have a large therapeutic range (between effective and toxic doses).

 The talk in the press room last year was that the reporters already knew that ICL was a non- story (probably reflecting only the fact that more immunological testing was being done), but were running with it anyway because everyone else was. What Wasn't in Berlin Our deepest impression from the conference is that the most important and productive approach possible to saving the lives of those already infected was simply not on the table there -- not among the scientists, not among the physicians, and not among the activists. The greatest need, everyone did seem to agree, is for better drugs -- including drugs which control HIV activity in chronically as well as acutely infected cells. Existing drugs are largely useless in chronically infected cells, which maintain reservoirs of virus to provide a source of endless mutations to escape control by the drugs we have and also by the immune system itself. But there are many potential treatments which do control HIV in chronically infected cells in laboratory tests, and are probably safe to use, and could be inexpensive and readily available.</td>
