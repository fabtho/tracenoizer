 The NIA leads the federal effort in supporting and conducting basic and clinical research on aging and the special needs of older people. Nilsen was funded by the National Institute on Aging through investigator-supported grants, as well as a grant to the Claude D. Pepper Older Americans Independence Center, University of Connecticut. At Pepper Centers, translational and basic scientists participate in studies linking molecular mechanisms with clinical interventions. .</td>

 The International PKD Gene Mutation Registry The PK Research Foundation is in the process of establishing the International PKD Gene Mutation Registry. , Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, United States Martijn H. , State University of Leiden, The Netherlands Peter H. , Boys Town National Research Hospital, United States Purpose The purpose of the International PKD Gene Mutation Registry is to increase and facilitate communications among PKD researchers who are working on mutant identifications and population screening. This registry will help avoid overlapping efforts and speed up the screening process.</td>
