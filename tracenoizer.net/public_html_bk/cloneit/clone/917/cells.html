Located in the Tianjin New Technology Industrial Park, the State Stem Cell Genetic Engineering Center is co-sponsored by the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Tianjin's Huayin Company, with an initial investment of 300 million yuan. The center will mainly focus on the collection, research and transplant of stem cells. It aims to become the country's largest stem cell bank and transplant base in three years. Research and application of stem cells have drawn worldwide attention in recent years.">

 . Many genes are used to specify features unique to each type of cell. Liver cells, for example, express genes for enzymes that detoxify poisons, while pancreas cells express genes for making insulin. To know how cells achieve such specialization, scientists need a way to identify which genes each type of cell expresses. Microarray technology now allows us to look at many genes at once and determine which are expressed in a particular cell type.</td>
