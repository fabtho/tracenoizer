Mutations are changes in DNA that can cause cancer by turning on cancer-causing genes or turning off the genes that suppress cancer. Carcinogens, such as ultraviolet radiation or the chemicals in cigarette smoke, routinely damage DNA, leading to numerous mutations. Luckily, DNA can repair itself, relying on proteins known as repair enzymes.</td>
