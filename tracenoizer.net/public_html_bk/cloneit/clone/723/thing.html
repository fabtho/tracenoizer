If you thought Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito made strange brothers, how about Robert Duvall and James Earl Jones. A Family Thing's premise is that Duvall's character, Earl Pilcher, has been raised as the son of white parents, even though his real mother was black. After the death of the woman he called "Mom", Earl learns about his true heritage, and heads north to Chicago to meet his half-brother, Raymond (Jones). However, Ray is less than pleased to see Earl, because he associates his white sibling with tragedy.</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"<td valign="center"> Buying the somewhat obsolete CPU's (oh yeah, it's a dual procesing board) saved us a bundle. And doing the build ourselves (my wife, two sons and me) we learn a whole lot more than I ever did playing with my erector set or Lionel train set as a kid. It's kinda become a family thing getting our knuckles bloody and making a mistake once in awhile, but it's worth the effort. ..</td><td valign="top"><img height="170" width="233" src="http://www.studiola.com/spotlight/moulinrouge//spotlight/moulin_rouge_images/nicolekidman.jpg"></td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1"><td valign="bottom"><img HEIGHT=380 WIDTH=250 src="http://www.smh.com.au/news/0105/23/entertainment//news/0105/23/graphics/ent1nicole.jpg"></td><td valign="bottom"> As much as I enjoyed trying out new products all the time, I've got to say I feel a kind of relief at finding one good hair care line. There is enough variety within it to keep me from getting bored. I switch to different products within it quite frequently without any troubles, and buildup is a thing of the past. I don't know if this line is for everyone, although I must say with the variety in it, it just might work for everyone. .</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><td valign="bottom"><img height=220 width=127 src="http://www.triviatribute.com/images/nicolekidman5a.jpg"></td><td valign="center"> I don't want a sexual relationship with her(really). -vector143- It does sound like she has her hands full, I'll assume she isn't married.
