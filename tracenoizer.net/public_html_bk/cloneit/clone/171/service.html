 These leaflets also include a weekly overview of the feature programmes and the frequencies of all foreign language broadcasts to that target aera. . My question was if 'BBC Worldwide' - the monthly magazine of the World Service was the only way to get the frequencies used. The subscription of this magazine costs 24 pounds per year and is - in my eyes - too expensive for those people who only want to find out a useful frequency. The answer was that there are leaflets available free of charge that are published twice a year (the next edition covers the period from October to March).</td>

 Listen for that station's signal to return to 4885 kilohertz. Cumbre DX has previously sent parts to help shortwave stations in Somalia and Bolivia return to the air. Medialink Worldwide Incorporated, based in New York, has signed a 2 million dollar contract with the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office to produce programs for London Radio Service, LRS. LRS might be seen as the alter-ego of BBC World Service. While BBC World Service insists on its editorial independence from the British government, LRS is operated on behalf of the British Foreign Office for the purpose of ensuring that the world's radio listeners receive a consistent message about Britain and its perspective on key issues.</td>
