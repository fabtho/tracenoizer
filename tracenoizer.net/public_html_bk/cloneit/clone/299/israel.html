 . The story of Gideon comes from the book of Judges, Chapter 6 in the Bible. The children of Israel had done bad things and God caused them to be defeated by the Midianites for seven years. God was very patient with Gideon when Gideon needed proof that it was an angel of God. This caused so much confusion in the camp that the Midianites turned on each other and killed each other.</td>

 The action starts with the house lights up and some extra lighting on the Narrator, which stays on for the whole script. Gideon is on stage, threshing wheat by bashing a sheaf against something (a chair would do). Let me tell you, mate, I'm doing a lot more for Israel than God is. (He resumes threshing, singing in time with the blows. ) David took a little sling and half a brick as well And David pulled the trigger and Goliath went to.</td>
