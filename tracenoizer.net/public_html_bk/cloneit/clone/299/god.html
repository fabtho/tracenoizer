 This caused so much confusion in the camp that the Midianites turned on each other and killed each other. . Gideon was a real person that God chose to lead his people from a period of disobedience and back into fellowship with God. The children of Israel had done bad things and God caused them to be defeated by the Midianites for seven years. God was very patient with Gideon when Gideon needed proof that it was an angel of God.</td>

 . The story of Gideon comes from the book of Judges, Chapter 6 in the Bible. The children of Israel had done bad things and God caused them to be defeated by the Midianites for seven years. God was very patient with Gideon when Gideon needed proof that it was an angel of God. This caused so much confusion in the camp that the Midianites turned on each other and killed each other.</td>

 The Lord thought otherwise, or so it would seem from today's lesson. So, yes, there was indeed something else for Gideon to do in addition to wheat farming. Then, in what might have seemed like just one more complication, God gave Gideon an assignment to be done before tackling the Midianite problem. God told Gideon to take down a heathen altar and cut down the grove where it sat. But I don't think Gideon really considered that as a legitimate option.</td>
