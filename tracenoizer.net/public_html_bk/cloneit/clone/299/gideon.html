This is a clearinghouse for GIDEON information with listings of associated surnames, queries on GIDEON related families and information and a place to find our other relatives. My Personal Gideon Lines My line of GIDEON goes back to Peter GIDEON, a Revolutionary War Soldier who was most likely born in Germany, though his Revolutionary War papers say "somewhere near Philadelphia" as his place of origin.</td>

 This caused so much confusion in the camp that the Midianites turned on each other and killed each other. . The story of Gideon comes from the book of Judges, Chapter 6 in the Bible. The children of Israel had done bad things and God caused them to be defeated by the Midianites for seven years. God was very patient with Gideon when Gideon needed proof that it was an angel of God.</td>
