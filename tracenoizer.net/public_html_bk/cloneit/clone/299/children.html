 . The story of Gideon comes from the book of Judges, Chapter 6 in the Bible. The children of Israel had done bad things and God caused them to be defeated by the Midianites for seven years. God was very patient with Gideon when Gideon needed proof that it was an angel of God. This caused so much confusion in the camp that the Midianites turned on each other and killed each other.</td>

 Note from McLeester - HHH notes name as Hoite in addition to Hoyt. 5 1993 notes that all Moses' sons were called Haight in later life. Rowley gives all the children of Moses except Mariam as Haight. Note from McLeester - It appears that Anna was married to a Hoyt before Thomas. Note from McLeester - It appears that Jane was married to a Hoyt before Eleazer.</td>

 . Gideon was a real person that God chose to lead his people from a period of disobedience and back into fellowship with God. The children of Israel had done bad things and God caused them to be defeated by the Midianites for seven years. God was very patient with Gideon when Gideon needed proof that it was an angel of God. This caused so much confusion in the camp that the Midianites turned on each other and killed each other.</td>
