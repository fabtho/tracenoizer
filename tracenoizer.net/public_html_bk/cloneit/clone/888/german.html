 Celan Biography Paul Celan Paul Celan was born in Czernovitz, in Romania, in 1920. Until 1918, this region of Romania had formed part of the Austro-Hungarian empire, a polyglot amalgam of nations stretching from Austria in the west to the Balkans in the south-east.

 Also, even though some of the highlighted links are in German, they may lead to English language texts. . Never fully comfortable with writing in the language of "the oppressors," he nonetheless produced a body of work that ranks him as one of the greatest German poets of the postwar era. This site is a useful starting point for students of Celan, not only providing a good deal of information on-site (most notably the "Celan Bibliography in English" and Hersch Segal's "The Influence of Yiddish and Jewishness on Celan"), but also directing the reader to points of academic interest off-site as well.

 We both live in the US and have a foot in both worlds. We saw our world as shattered by WWII and its aftermath, Jews disappeared - while the language with which we describe our own suffering is rich in nuance and texture, the language we use to describe the fate of Jews is abstract and devoid of emotional resonance. In my own research, I have found that many of my countrymen believe that there is in fact an abundance of literature written by German gentiles which deals with the plight of European Jews in general and German Jews in particular. In reality, there is a distinct absence of Holocaust victims as protagonists in literature written by German gentiles. Many if not most Germans seem to consider literature about their own suffering during WWII and the chaos of the postwar years, and condemnation of the Hitler regime as synonymous with writing about Holocaust victims.</td>
