 My blood kin is then, not only the people I am related to or people whom I happen to like, but everybody. The very first Brotherhood we encounter in life is ourselves. Our physical and interior bodies are composed of many Brotherhoods. Man being a multidimensional entity, we have the Brotherhood of our seven principles to begin with. Let us base our very first actions toward Brotherhood on the fact that man has, or rather is, Seven Spirits.</td>

 It has close co-operation with departments for flexibility, sustainable contacts with relevant research frontiers and admittance to undergraduate, graduate and doctoral programmes as well as the universities' channels towards privat firms and public agencies. How can users participate in this process, and how can different design professionals participate and co-operate. We are a group of researchers and designers with a background in architecture, systems design, work psychology, educational drama and physical work environments who have formed a project to explore these questions in practice. The envisionment workshop is implemented in an interdisciplinary laboratory environment for learning and change where real work can be simulated in full scale, envisioning working environments, work organisation, production technology and premises. The envisionment workshop can be utilised by people in organisations who want to envision different possible futures at their work place, for participatory design of future work and appropriate technology.</td>

 Their presence is seductive and intimate, not physically overwhelming. This is due to their small size and soft, often pastel-like colours. The design of the book reflects the physical experience of the paintings. Understated self portraits, and finely printed essays as well as the trial texts and an interview are immaculately laid out on creamy thick pages. Inc, New York 2000 Bubble gum flavour pervades Issue 8 of this Americas oriented contemporary art magazine, evoked by a (real) bubble gum mouse mat neatly slipped inside the back cover.</td>
