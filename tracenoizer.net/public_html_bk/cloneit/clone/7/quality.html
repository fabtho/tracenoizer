 . The Goal Equivalence Model, GEM TEQ is hindered by N-factors such as absenteeism and a high turn-over rate and is improved by P-factors such as motivation, knowledge and responsibility. The working life quality, WLQ, is the basis for the P-factors and a cause of the N-factors. There is also a positive relation between TEQ and WLQ due to job security, pride in working in a successful organization and the rational measures taken by a company understanding the importance of WLQ for TEQ. The model also includes the very important D-tools - work organization, man-machine systems, learning and dialogue, which operate on both TEQ and WLQ.</td>

 Thus, efficient ergonomic intervention requires these risk factors to be identified and described in terms of their influence on mechanical or psychosocial exposures. Furthermore, the ergonomist should consider that production systems generally undergo continuous improvements guided by efficiency considerations; so-far the ergonomic consequences of this process are largely unknown. customers demands, product variety and quality and short delivery time. Several of these models seem to contain a potential not only for improved productivity, quality and efficiency but also for improved ergonomics. However, some studies suggest that the realization of these models may not always lead to good ergonomics.</td>
