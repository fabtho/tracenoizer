<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" A new wage system was developed, but has not been put into operation yet. The employees were worried about the new system mostly because of lack of information about it and about how it will function. The positive support from the management was very important for a successful result of the change process. A follow-up study with the same methods will be performed two years after the previous study. Demolition began in April, 1996 and was finished in February, 1997.">

 A seminar series towards employees' organisations has been started. It has close co-operation with departments for flexibility, sustainable contacts with relevant research frontiers and admittance to undergraduate, graduate and doctoral programmes as well as the universities' channels towards privat firms and public agencies. How can users participate in this process, and how can different design professionals participate and co-operate. We are a group of researchers and designers with a background in architecture, systems design, work psychology, educational drama and physical work environments who have formed a project to explore these questions in practice. The envisionment workshop is implemented in an interdisciplinary laboratory environment for learning and change where real work can be simulated in full scale, envisioning working environments, work organisation, production technology and premises.</td>

 ) discussions during the nights that we have spent with Elina and Hanna at their place. I also want to express special thanks to Docent Maija Wessman who has been a helpful and open-minded guide for me. Her practical advice were essential in the process of finishing this thesis work. Jaakko Kaukonen, MD, is thanked for being always very flexible and optimistic and thus creating a cosy working atmosphere in the upstairs lab. I am respectful to Docent Arto Orpana whose knowledge in practical laboratory matters is unbeatable.</td>
