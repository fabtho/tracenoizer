 Let us base our very first actions toward Brotherhood on the fact that man has, or rather is, Seven Spirits. Let us establish a Brotherhood of seven bodies or principles in ourselves first, before we could or should even think of going further and attempt to solve problems for others or for the world at large. These seven bodies or spirits are the real scene of battle, and to achieve the impossible, we must possess superhuman faith, and be ready for making superhuman sacrifice in exchange for superhuman power. Essentially, we must give from our lower parts to the higher. (In reality nothing is higher or lower, all being one.</td>

 How can users participate in this process, and how can different design professionals participate and co-operate. We are a group of researchers and designers with a background in architecture, systems design, work psychology, educational drama and physical work environments who have formed a project to explore these questions in practice. The envisionment workshop is implemented in an interdisciplinary laboratory environment for learning and change where real work can be simulated in full scale, envisioning working environments, work organisation, production technology and premises. The envisionment workshop can be utilised by people in organisations who want to envision different possible futures at their work place, for participatory design of future work and appropriate technology. The first example of the envisionment workshop was carried out with a chemical factory, Perstorp Chemitec.</td>

 The design of the book reflects the physical experience of the paintings. Understated self portraits, and finely printed essays as well as the trial texts and an interview are immaculately laid out on creamy thick pages. Inc, New York 2000 Bubble gum flavour pervades Issue 8 of this Americas oriented contemporary art magazine, evoked by a (real) bubble gum mouse mat neatly slipped inside the back cover. Designed by Pae White, the A3 sized posters are brought together in a cotton covered box as an investigation of the relationship between architecture and art. Elizabeth Peyton, Liam Gillick, Martin Boyce and Jason Dodge are just a sample of the 30-contributing artists.</td>
