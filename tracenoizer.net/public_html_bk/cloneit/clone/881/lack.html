 Funding The ISLE project is funded for two years by the NSF and the EC, as part of a joint program Multilingual Information Access and Management. US-ISLE consists of three groups, one having three subgroups. As such corpora have proliferated, and have found uses across a rapidly expanding set of languages, disciplines and technologies, the lack of agreed standards has become a critical problem. Of course, the standardization of tagsets is necessarily an open-ended task, and is always subject to revision as the underlying domains change and the theories evolve. Yet the standardization of the annotation structures themselves is a goal that could be substantially achieved in a 3-5 year timeframe.</td>

 .Almost three years later, they say they are fighting a losing battle. SAS efforts to raise the necessary funds to offer a course in Hindi have faltered, and members said a lack of support from the administration has not made matters any easier. "Evasive is a very good word to describe the administration. Brodhead has met with SAS leaders several times to discuss the teaching of Hindi at Yale.</td>

 Instead, every programming language allows for a single character data type. When distinctions between whitespace and non-printing, or between upper and lower case are important, the data itself is examined. This typing of variables and the attendant lack of facility for dealing with heterogeneous data is exactly what C does for everything BUT character variables. Now imagine how much easier programming would be if all variables could hold any object as easily as char variables hold any character, and that variables representing non-atomic data could contain elements of any type of data, in the same way that strings can contain any character. In Lisp, the data itself is (conceptually) typed by a tag.</td>
