Entry Information and form available here MORE 2000 Wrapup Report Donors and Sponsors of the 2000 Virginia Film Festival Guests and Programs Films The 13th Annual Virginia Film Festival, Animal Attractions, was a smash hit. News of this year's festival blanketed the community and country like never before, thanks to the wide distribution of wire stories on Anthony Hopkins' award and enthusiastic and extensive regional media coverage.

The Virginia Film Festival is a program of the Department of Drama at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Virginia.</td>
