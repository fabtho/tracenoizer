 HANS JACOB RIEMENSPERGER Brochure by Hans Jacob Reiemensperger to attract immigration to South Carolina, pub. 1740 TRUE AND FULLY DEPENDABLE GOOD NEWS FROM THE ENGLISH ROYAL PROVINCE CAROLINA Brought here by trustworthy men who went there four years ago, now happy in their turn to come back and by this news attempt to dertermine you upon the same venture. Also, it is well known that in Germany and Switzerland there are poor, unemployed hardworking people who would delight themselves in this gift of land, but who cannot affort the expense of the passage across the sea. This land remains with him and his children as their property, and the poor remain with him and labor with him until the costs of their transportation be repaid. When this is done and reported, the poor man becomes free, and land will be measured out to him also.</td>
