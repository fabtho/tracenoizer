 The Association Council meeting that took place in Luxembourg on 11 April 2000, after an interval of 3 years, marked an important turning point in this context. The Association Council adopted important decisions for the period ahead. ACCESSION PARTNERSHIP, NATIONAL PROGRAMME, SCREENING Eight sub-committees under the Association Committee have been set up to carry out the screening process (Annex 1). As it has done for the other candidates, the EU has assigned the 31 areas that constitute the acquis communautaire to those eight sub-committees for Turkey. For this purpose, the Association Committee decided on the working procedures of the sub-committees which aimed to monitor the process of analytical examination of the acquis.</td>

In engem Zusammenhang mit der Digitalisierung steht die sogenannte Konvergenz.</td>

 The European Commission recalled this morning that the wide range of measures it has put in place, if fully implemented, are sufficient to ensure a high level of public health and safety. The Commission however agreed that additionally action was needed to restore consumer confidence. To complement the legislative measures in place, the introduction of a comprehensive programme for Community-wide testing for BSE would provide the necessary assurances to consumers. In the light of the discussions in the Council, a proposal will be put to the Member States in the Standing Veterinary Committee on 22 November. Mr Byrne has already called upon Member States to start even earlier the already approved EU-wide testing programme on sick animals.</td>
