<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" . Unlike the main parade on March 17th, Sunday's parade will allow gays and lesbians to take part under their own banners. Mrs Clinton aroused controversy recently when she said she would march in the main parade along Fifth Avenue on St Patrick's Day, apparently unaware that its organisers, the Ancient Order of Hibernians, bans the Irish Lesbian and Gay Organisation (ILGO) from marching as a group. The ILGO criticised Mrs Clinton, who is noted for her strong feminist views, for her intention to march in a parade which excludes gays and lesbians if they carry a distinguishing banner. Now Mrs Clinton has announced that she will also march in a St Patrick's parade this Sunday in the Queens area of New York which will allow gay and lesbian groups to participate with their banners.">
