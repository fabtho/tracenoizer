 Seems like the hard part would be keeping the desired shape as the glass cooled. . I misread your message(I just got up)and though your wrote "A hard liquer mirror" and thought you must have been sipping to much of your idea.

Seems like the hard part would be keeping the desired shape as the glass cooled.</td>

 My fvorite book is Life, the Universe and Everything. The hive of scum and villany If there is no spoon, how do they eat soup in the Matrix. I had always believed that the Great Question was simply a standard addition problem that no one in the text ever managed to properly figure out, originally derived from the poorly worded request of the creators of Deep Thought. After all, the creators of Deep Thought wanted the answer to Life, The Universe, And Everything. If we already know that the answer is 42, then all we have to do is add these three variables together.</td>
