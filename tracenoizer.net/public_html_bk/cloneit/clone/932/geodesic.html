 But maybe he did did have a sixth sense, since he chose to work as a professer at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale. . Fuller (MPI-FKF) Max-Planck-Institut fuer Festkoerperforschung Andersen Group LMTO C60 GW Clusters Richard Buckminster Fuller (1895-1983) Richard Buckminster Fuller was an American engineer and architect who is renowned for his geodesic domes. In these spherical domes ribs are placed in a triangular or polygonal pattern and lie on the geodesic lines of a sphere. Geodesic domes are very lightweight structures that can span large areas.</td>
