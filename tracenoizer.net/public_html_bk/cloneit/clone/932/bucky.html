 .) They are special buildings because they are quite energy efficient and relatively simple to build. Buckminster Fuller, also known as "Bucky" Fuller, designed this building. He had many ideas on how to make buildings cheaper to build by using materials and building techniques in non-traditional ways. This geodesic dome building was built in Montreal, Canada in 1967 and it was quite a strange sight.</td>

 In my years spent researching my book "Buckminster Fuller's Universe" and working on other Fuller writing, I had not seen some of the photographs and illustrations displayed here. I don't recommend it as an introduction to the ideas and wisdom of Fuller because, as is true with almost all of Fuller's writing, the ideas need to be studied not read over once, and this book does not provide a complete enough picture to be a good study guide. Look to the writing of others for your introduction to Bucky, and look to this book to add to your understanding of a man who is recognized as one of the great thinkers, geniuses and Renaissance men of modern times. In addition to presenting a wealth of new material from Fuller's archives it also arranges and presents Bucky's life and works in an innovative format that emphasizes the larger view of his work and the natural progression of his thoughts. The authors have taken the time to do the re-search which allowed them to see the larger picture.</td>
