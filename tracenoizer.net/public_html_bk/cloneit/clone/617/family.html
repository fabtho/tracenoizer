 It is a most uncommon name and it is suggested that it is an Anglicised version of the French name Carlieu. . Knapp Family of the Isle of Wight Any information on this family would be appreciated Andrew was descended from Thomas Knapp, an agricultural labourer born 1793 in Brading, Isle of Wight and his wife Mary and who moved west to the town of Wootton Bridge, Arreton after their marriage. Harriet was christened in 1632 by the Minister William Bailey at a meeting of the Providence Zion Chapel Bible Christians held at Little Corve in the Parish of Chale, her father being described as a Yeoman. This religion was in fact, that of the Wesleyans, which by the end of the century, became the methodist Church.</td>

 They beat Knapp and another man with trash cans, pipes and bicycles. The attack put both men in the hospital, but Knapp suffered severe injuries and spent several weeks in a coma. All six attackers got the maximum jail time, but the victim's family says the sentence is light compared to the sentence Troy Knapp will serve for life. He's confined to a bed, suffers regular seizures and must wear a diaper. Knapp was wheeled into the courtroom today to tell the judge about the lynching.</td>
