 I'm just wondering how realizable it would be to stick to those goals and what it would produce. Partly because until recently it was built by successive improvements over a monolithic core. Also because it is very hard when you have limited resources (and who hasn't) to make cleaning up and splitting in pieces a priority versus just adding the new features everybody wants (that is until we get some magic where people can more easily add and share and interoperate the features themselves and core people can concentrate on meeting the extensibility goals and making sure that people doing extensions can do their job instead of doing (only some) of features. Now obviously it will be much faster with today C compilers than with today VM technology but it should be usable in both, and once you discount the vm overhead, the Java should not be much less efficient. This is for sure not applicable for the PalmPilot version but just a way to potentially have a(nother) cool scripting language for java.</td>

 The designers and craftsmen of this period are also to be attributed with interjecting human comfort and scale as an important feature of the furnishings. Since many people come from many parts of the world, the United States is compromised of many people from many nations. As far as its implications on the profession, it could be a good thing, in that a client may feel more confident in his designer choice for a particular job if he is specialized in that area. On the other hand, it could be negative if a client liked the work a designer did for him on a commercial job and wanted him to do a residential job and the designer refused. Slips of the tongue can betray the visual thinker's tenuous relation to words.</td>
