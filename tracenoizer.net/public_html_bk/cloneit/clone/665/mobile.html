Coast Guard radio station providing a continuous maritime mobile distress and safety service on frequency 156. (1) These Regulations apply in respect of a ship that is (a) a Canadian ship navigating in any waters; or (b) a non-Canadian ship engaged in the coasting trade, as defined in subsection 2(1) of the Coasting Trade Act.

 Essentially, you'd re-design the IF section to amplify the actual station frequency and hook the antenna directly to its input. The Nazis sold thousands of cheap radios with only one station. i also heard that in the uk, where one needs a license for their tv, one can be busted by such a mobile unit (a van). One chip solutions exist, but unfortunately aren't as cheap as you'd expect, and aren't as widely available. The old Ferranti ZN414 is one from my generation, but to be honest, the scale of manufacturing of a production run of OEM lines, tends to imply that it might be cheaper to get a far east radio manuf.</td>
