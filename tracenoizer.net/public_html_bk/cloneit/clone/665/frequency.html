 . My question was if 'BBC Worldwide' - the monthly magazine of the World Service was the only way to get the frequencies used. The subscription of this magazine costs 24 pounds per year and is - in my eyes - too expensive for those people who only want to find out a useful frequency. The answer was that there are leaflets available free of charge that are published twice a year (the next edition covers the period from October to March). twelve different ones (each for a certain target area).</td>

 The FSS will be used to test range systems (such as command links) prior to missions and to monitor their performance during missions. System Description The FSS is a spectrum monitoring and direction finding system that can remotely control up to 13 surveillance sites. Major Subsystems Frequency Surveillance Control Center (FSCC) Controls all functions of the FSS Monitors status of the surveillance sites Correlates LOBs to geo-locate the emitters Fixed Surveillance Sites (FXS) Performs spectrum monitoring (SM) Performs direction finding (DF) Returns signal parametars, and LOBs Remotely or locally controlled Vehicle Systems Transportable Surveillance Sites (TSS) Trailer mounted Performs all functions of the FXS Remotely or locally controlled Requires Telecommunication hookup for remote operations Mobile Surveillance Sites (MSS) Self propelled, (Utility Van) Designed for extended manual surveillance Performs all functions of the FXS local control only Chase Vehicles Self propelled (Chevrolet Suburban) Designed for short term interference resolution Performs all functions of the FXS local control only FSS Advantages Remote control capability reduces manpower requirements Equipment is primarily COTS or NDI Commonality of equipment stressed in the design Flexible contract in place Frequency Surveillance Control Center and fixed site NRE are already paid for Expandable design (up to 13 remote sites) Remote Controlled Surveillance System Monitors from 20 MHz to 40 GHz with options to extend the frequency range down to 2 MHz and up to 100 GHz Detects and geo-locates emitters Provides signal and spectral analysis tools Identifies modulation techniques, measures signal strength and cross references with known emitters to determine authorization Same Man Machine interface at all stations TSS Layout Chase Vehicle Layout MSS Layout . ..</td>
