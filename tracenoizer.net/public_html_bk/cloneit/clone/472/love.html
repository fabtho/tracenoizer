Michael Love Web posted Friday, April 27, 2001 ADRIAN, Ga. - Peebles Curry Durden Mortuary announces the death of Michael Jeremy "Red" Love, age 19, of Love Rd. on Wednesday, April 25, 2001, at his residence after a brief illness.</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1"><td valign="bottom"> He's been the player who comes to Harbour Town after contending at Augusta and gets all the congratulations for being close. Someone does it every year, the same way someone sneaks into town after tripping over a divot to drop a chance at the Masters and ends up getting treated like the widow at the wake here. ) So, when Love arrived on the first tee Tuesday for the Gillette Tour Challenge and got the handshakes and approving nods, he took the "well dones," and went about trying to get past another Augusta almost. It even starts to take away some of the questions that get carried around after finishing two shots out of a playoff in a major championship. It's certainly not something you want to get used to.</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="6"><td valign="center"><img height=113 width=220 src="http://205.188.218.46/wash20/lovepoll"></td><td valign="center"> They lined the fairways with rough a few years ago and they've redone several greens.
