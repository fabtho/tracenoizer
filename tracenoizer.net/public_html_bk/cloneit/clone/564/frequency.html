The frequency assignment within this frequency range is managed by the Association of American Railroads (AAR), which is an industry association composed of the various railroads of the United States and Canada. With the increasing use of run-through trains and leased motive power, many of America's railroads are equipping locomotives with radio transceivers capable of using all 97 railroad frequencies. For simplicity, the frequencies are assigned channel numbers that are used to select the proper frequency on any AAR 97-channel radio.">

 . My question was if 'BBC Worldwide' - the monthly magazine of the World Service was the only way to get the frequencies used.
