 Any unauthorised use, copying or mirroring is prohibited. . The Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA) outlined the plan in a discussion paper, released for comment today, which aims to solve the problem of unacceptable interference to GWN's channel 11 analog service that the use of channel 11 for Network Ten's digital service in Perth could create. Digital television services are due to begin on January 1 next year. "In finalising the Perth digital channel plan, the ABA wished to assure itself that appropriate arrangements were being put in place to deal with interference and compensation issues relating to the transmission and reception of analog services in adjacent markets,'' ABA chairman David Flint said in a statement.</td>

 What you need to know before buying Many different models of family radios are now available. Channels The main price differentiation seems to be the number of channels that a unit supports. A new development are single channel radios whose channel assignment can be switched between any of the 14 channels, usually through a not-easily-accessed switch (like in the battery compartment). This is the most important feature to consider, because FRS channels are shared by all of the users in range. That means that anybody with a FRS unit in your area can listen in on a particular channel and even talk on the same channel you're using.</td>
