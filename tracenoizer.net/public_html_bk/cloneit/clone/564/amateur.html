 For additional information refer to the Amateur Certification - Fact Sheet. . Traditionally, amateur radio operators were issued two separate authorizations, an Amateur Radio Operator Certificate and a radio station licence. The Amateur Radio Operator Certificate was valid for life and had no fee associated with it, while the radio licence was issued on a yearly basis, and a licence renewal fee was charged. In the interest of reducing unnecessary administrative tasks, Industry Canada has combined these documents into one, the Amateur Radio Operator Certificate.</td>

 Canadian amateurs do not require any special authorization to operate their stations in the United States, and conversely, American amateurs do not require special authorization to operate while in Canada. . The Amateur Radio Operator Certificate was issued for life and had no fee associated with it, while the radio station licence was issued on a yearly basis and a licence renewal fee was charged. Effective April 1, 2000, Industry Canada has combined these documents into one authorization, the Amateur Radio Operator Certificate. Although it is no longer necessary for amateurs to renew their licence annually, they are required to inform Industry Canada of any changes in their mailing address.</td>
