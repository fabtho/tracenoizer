 For additional information refer to the Amateur Certification - Fact Sheet. . Traditionally, amateur radio operators were issued two separate authorizations, an Amateur Radio Operator Certificate and a radio station licence. The Amateur Radio Operator Certificate was valid for life and had no fee associated with it, while the radio licence was issued on a yearly basis, and a licence renewal fee was charged. In the interest of reducing unnecessary administrative tasks, Industry Canada has combined these documents into one, the Amateur Radio Operator Certificate.</td>
