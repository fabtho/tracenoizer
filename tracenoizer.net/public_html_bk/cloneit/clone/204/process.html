 Oki also pays attention to the environment as a factor that influences quality. . Oki also performs process setting and process control to achieve customer demanded quality. For critical characteristics that strongly influence initial quality and reliability, Oki uses control charts to maintain a stable process status and process capability. Abnormalities detected by control charts are managed based on abnormality processing rules.</td>
