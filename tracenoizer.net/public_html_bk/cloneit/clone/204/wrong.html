 A Brotherhood of Man first of all means that we strive to be aware of, and understand, our own dual nature. This means patience with our failures, and a love and understanding for our own seemingly "horrible" natures. It is a wrong standpoint to say, "I am bad", "this and that person is bad". Because it is untrue and a curse against the Christ. Nothing and nobody is "bad"; everything and everybody is dual.</td>
