 25 and later; the version distributed with the kernel still doesn't quite work as of version 2. 27, and that version works "out of the box" at least for me. However, the initial probe code is sloppy enough (blame me. ) that you might want to try the "completely untested" version below if you have trouble. Cleaning up the probe code is the next thing on my agenda for this, so stay tuned.</td>

 If anyone has any emails with useful information send them or a patch to notes. If you're interested in helping with this email me. If it works out like I hope I'll rip the sync code out of cvs. 2001-05-12 (Kuroyi) Added more reverse engineering approaches from James Farwell. 2 but you still need the updated xine_dvd_libcss_plugin-dxr3.</td>

 Then when the Diamond Rio came out, we added support for that as well. The upshot is, on this site you'll find source, documentation and binaries that let you do things the makers never intended, along with support for various different operating systems. Diamond RioNow, you can use your Rio with a proper operating system like Linux, or take the code and adapt it to your preferred OS. Just follow the link for source code, pre-built versions for lesser systems, and other information. The company is based in Sussex in the UK, 40 minutes from London by rail.</td>
