 Needed to have a post coital test today and my hubby just couldn't perform to order. he has a terrible case of white coat syndrome due to a long hospitalisation when he was younger. just the thought of the test to come made it completley impossible. We have both spent a sleepless tearful night feeling failures and not knowing what to do next. it was so hard to sneak the time off work to go to the test and now its all for nothing.</td>

 They have airbags inside them, like a car, so we use those. It seems to get better with time and I'm pretty happy with it. I thought it was not such a good instrument, but so far so good, I like it. Agnieszka, her cello, her father bought it from some sort of old mans hut full of instruments in Poland. Julia has an incredible 18th century english cello, but she does not take it out.</td>

 I had the pleasure of hearing her read at the Chameleon (a club on Valencia St. in the Mission for those of you not in SF) in September. Surprisingly, she read during one of their Monday open-mike poetry nights, and prefaced her reading by clarifying that her work was not poetry, which I thought was brilliantly funny. That got the place quieter than I'd ever seen it, and she deserved it. I'd thought about writing for years before I finally actually did it about six years ago.</td>
