 Thank You for your much appreciated and encouraged comments. . Love makes all the difference -- well certainly a huge difference. Without any doubt I've said and meant and believed all these statements. I feel all this 'love' stuff when practiced without compassion and understanding and acceptance, leaves a space for judgment and dismissal.</td>
