 Four artists in Basel - Birckhauser, Stoecklin, Leupin and Brun - became leaders of a style both playful and elegant, with lithographic standards the envy of the world. Leupin, Brun and the other Basel sachplakat artists turned to a humorous style less reliant upon the rich color and textures of lithographic printing. Leupin in many ways was the successor to Cappiello in his ability to capture the essence of a selling proposition through a visual metaphor. Because of its strong reliance on typographic elements, the new style came to be known as the International Typographic Style. The overall impression is simple and rational, tightly structured and serious, clear and objective, and harmonious.</td>
