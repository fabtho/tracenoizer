A 2M byte DiskOnChip is programmed as a bootable ROM-disk with ROM-DOS and an array of utilities. This silicon disk also provides on board disk space for your application program and any necessary device drivers to simplify testing of the target software. The primary purpose of the RDK kit is to provide a pre-configured system which is operational right out of the box allowing the development engineer to be productive within minutes. .">

 We provide this NeXT section for people who still use NeXT operating systems. . Mounting means that you can open files directly from the server with any application you like, as if they were on a local disk. If your fingers are not well trained, you will often hit eject instead of backspace. This application reassigns eject to Apple-eject, making unintentional ejects unlikely.</td>

 It also includes a broad set of functions for accessing geomatics data files using the GeoGateway technology (raster, and vector files). The standard EASI intrinsics are summarized in the EASI Function Reference. In addition to the standard intrinsics listed above, that apply to all EASI enabled applications, there can also be application specific extensions to the set of intrinsics. For instance, ImageWorks, SPANS and PCI Author include a variety of simple GUI Intrinsics for interacting with users. EASI Modelling EASI also includes a sophisticated raster modelling command.</td>

 "They can get links to opinions for consumer reviews or to Etown for professional reviews, along with merchants and prices. Etown can serve the content from one of its several Sun Solaris systems running ATG Dynamo 4. 1, a Java application server and Vignette Storyserver, a content publishing system. Etown can help e-retailers avoid having to hire specialists to support products they didn't make, said Gomez Advisors analyst Mark Gambale. "If you're running an IT shop and you have good expertise in some areas, but realize another company can handle these needs, it's just a matter of how you can seamlessly do it," Gambale said.</td>
