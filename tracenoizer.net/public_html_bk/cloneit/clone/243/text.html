 Who is able or wants to handwrite hundreds of pages so they are readable for others. This approach might as well be a return to pre-Gutenberg times. According to the Italian writer and philosopher Umberto Eco, the function of the text is to create the Model reader. Text is a tool used by a reader, which enables him to speculate. It does not limit the range of questions that it provokes.</td>

 But too many designers who studied at Basel did not really understand what it was about and ended up producing school exercises in their professional work. " - Hamish Muir, 8vo (1990) "To teach is not difficult. You must not teach them fashion, you must teach them how to create clean, clear, structured text. And you don't realize that when you've never worked before, because you don't have the skills to even begin to appreciate Utopia. When you go out into the world and practice design, and you're under the pressure of work, then you realize the value of having time to explore things.</td>
