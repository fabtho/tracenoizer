 Graphic Design 101 with Stephanie Schleicher teaches creative solutions to real-life design problems. Successful design needs careful planning and research before ideas are explored. Approaching a problem without knowledge or preparation will make the problem more difficult to solve. You need to use basic design principles to achieve success in whatever you are trying to design. In this 1 day course you will learn the four basic design principles with the use of type and images.</td>

 Includes 24 page insert designed and produced in Zurich, Switzerland. SOLD OUT (1990) "Most of the work that people do in Basel is meant as exercises and are isolated processes from which you can learn. And you're supposed to use that knowledge in varied ways. But too many designers who studied at Basel did not really understand what it was about and ended up producing school exercises in their professional work. " - Hamish Muir, 8vo (1990) "To teach is not difficult.</td>

 If you are a pro, climb down off that high horse and admit that you don't know it all (there are several quizzes in this book, some of which may very well put you on the spot). TNDDB covers the basic principles of graphic design in fun, easy to use chapters - and there are excellent illustrations to back up what Robin Williams is showing you as she cuts away some of the mystique that surrounds design. It's said that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing. But there's nothing nearly so dangerous as an awful lot of ignorance. This book won't turn you into Neville Brody, Paul Rand, or Saul Bass (to name but three), but it will change the way you look at design.</td>
