I've been there three years now and I have to say it has been one of the more interesting and enjoyable facets of my job. Also in 1996 we started the Brigg Music Club which has been exceptionally successful in a short space of time, attracting loads of different bands from all across the area. We put on gigs once a month in our spiritual home, The Brittania.
