 . They are also used in conjunction with the Long Code for spreading the CDMA Reverse Channel. They are both derived from period 215 -1 LFSR sequences, augmented with an extra zero bit to bring the length to an even power of two. The short code LFSR tap polynomials are, for the I-sequence (1) and for the Q-sequence . (2) The extra zero bit is inserted in each sequence immediately after the occurrence of 14 consecutive zeros from the generator register.</td>

 To make matters worse, I can no longer update the URL for your site, so if your site moves, you will have to update it yourself. A WebRing is a set of web pages that have been linked to each other. Thing is, there are a good number of Atari 8-bit related pages out there in net land. WebRing page Include The Atari 8-bit Computer WebRing link in a suitable place on your page. If the link doesn't show up within a weekup then send me an e-mail.</td>

 .htm has some general purpose I2C routines written in HiTech C. htm The SAPIN3 is a microcontroller based module that converts 2 analog inputs to an 8 bit value, reads a single digital input, and serially transmits the values at 9600 baud. This simple device requires only 1 integrated circuit and a handful of discrete components. The software is written in C using the CCS PCM C Compiler which is a powerful and cost effective compiler.</td>
