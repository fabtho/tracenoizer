If you want to explore full-text materials beyond the licensed full-text services and citation databases, you have come to the right place but do not stop with just this page. There is a great deal of full-text material available on the Internet, free of charge. This page provides pointers mainly to publicly accessible collections of full-text (often book-length) materials. The Library also links to more full-text materials (including individual titles) through the Internet Subject Browser, through Serial Publications, and through Government Databases, Documents and Publications.</td><td valign="center"><img height="174" width="250" src="http://www.webster.edu/filmseries/graphics/petitsfreres.jpg"></td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4"<td valign="bottom"> I have also discovered some older films that were unknown to me in 1998. The earliest films are best described as "home movies" made by British colonial officers posted to or passing through Aden Colony. There is a long series of short ethnographic studies of material culture made by Walter Dostal in Hadhramawt for the Encyclopaedia Cinematographica. The Institut fuer Wissenchaftlichen provided complete data on the Encyclopaedia Cinematographica materials. A number of users have been kind enough to introduce me to new films.</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"<td valign="center"> - - The Sikandar Nama, e Bara, a translation of the first of the two parts of the fifth poem of the Khamsa, by H. Wilberforce Clarke (1881) And there is biographical information to be found in these preludes (and in Nizami's postludes). But only a scholar, who has to make sure not to miss anything, would want to read all of this material. Some translators solve this problem by casting off those sections entirely. There exists no complete version of Khosrau and Shirin or Layla and Majnun in any language that I can read.</td><td valign="bottom"><img height="166" width="250" src="http://www.webster.edu/filmseries/graphics/summer.jpg"></td><tr></table><br>read more at: <a href="http://www.netguide.de">http://www.netguide.de</a><br><br></font><font size=-6> <a class="nav" href="http://www.nektar.ch/klon/337/index.html">.</a><br><br></font></body></html>
