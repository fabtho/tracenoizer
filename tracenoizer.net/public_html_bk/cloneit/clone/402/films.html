Called the epicenter of local film culture by the Minnesota Daily, the UFS runs films at Bell Auditorium and Nicholson Auditorium 360 days a year. Although it brings in top-notch art house films and the occasional revival show, foreign films are its real specialty. The UFS has been a part of campus life since 1962, when it was founded as Minnesota's first (and only) non-profit organization to exhibit foreign and independent films.</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="2"<td valign="top"> .
