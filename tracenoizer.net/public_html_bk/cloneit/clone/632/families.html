 Of course, claiming to be The Gideon Family is an exercise in hubris, if not arrogance. But why should this author disappoint those that have come to expect a certain level of behavior. Granted there are other families of the Gideon name; none are mine. We're experimenting with different formats in which to display ourselves, so this page is subject to drastic changes at odd moments. .</td>

 If you have your genealogy online, send us your URL and a brief list of related surnames and content and we'll be happy to place a link here to your site. . This page is for ALL GIDEON (and variant spellings) FAMILIES, not just my line. This is a clearinghouse for GIDEON information with listings of associated surnames, queries on GIDEON related families and information and a place to find our other relatives. My Personal Gideon Lines My line of GIDEON goes back to Peter GIDEON, a Revolutionary War Soldier who was most likely born in Germany, though his Revolutionary War papers say "somewhere near Philadelphia" as his place of origin.</td>
