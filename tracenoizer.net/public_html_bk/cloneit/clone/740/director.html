 The quest becomes hopelessly personal as he documents a series of affairs and attractions that have him to paddling out to obscure islands and chasing down high school crushes. While McElwee does circle back to the subject of Sherman now and then, it's clear that his primary obsession is finding his own place in the world--he's a liberal from a conservative family, a pacifist in the nuclear world, an intellectual who craves passion. In Theaters Sundance crowd-pleaser Jump Tomorrow (from first-time feature director Joel Hopkins) borrows from screwball comedies and the indie underground to create a modern, mischievous, and multiethnic romantic comedy. The story revolves around Nigerian-born George, a shy and conservative guy working at a travel agency in New York City. On the eve of his arranged marriage, George crosses paths with the vivacious Alicia and discovers that life is suddenly ripe with possibilities.</td>
