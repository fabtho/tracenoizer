Niklaus Troxler, better know as graphic designer or organizer of the Willisau Jazz Festival than as exhibition curator, somehow managed to find so many graphically interesting political posters from the time between the 1960's until today, that we may have to reconsider the bad esthetic reputation that political posters usually have. Below is a selection from the 50 posters in the exhibition. Keep in mind that the swiss political system is characterized not only by elections from the local to the national level, but also by frequent votes on all kinds of subjects, from an increase in taxes to the introduction of daylight saving time.">

 There are no rules anymore and I have to figure out for myself what my ethics are, what my religion is. I have to find for myself a way to make this world a little less strange. Graphic design has given me an opportunity to do this. these are both exciting and difficult times in terms of teaching. They don't look at you as a teacher, like we did at Ruder.</td>
