 A strange Austrian artist feels attracted to an unusual Japanese young lady he met in New York's Chelsea Hotel and who found a mysterious monument in Tokyo. The privileged young Japanese girl finds her freedom in the role of Lift Girl, which reduces her many choices to a simple 'up' or 'down'. A British radio reporter who lives in New York falls in love with a sacked Japanese salaryman. Characters and cultures clash, opposite poles meet. The characters are not 'built up', there are no conclusions.</td>
