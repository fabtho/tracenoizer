 As the council embarked upon the process of creating the new city's legal framework and making plans for a municipal water system and a host of other infrastructure improvements, however, they felt that it was also important to provide the community with at least a stopgap seat of government. During this time, municipal elections were held in the roller mill, operated by Mayor Felton Vollmer, on the west edge of Winsted Lake. The city of Winsted did not actually own a building until 1890, when the council agreed to erect a wood-framed barn to house equipment used by the recently organized volunteer fire department. Erected on a leased lot near the center of town, the fire barn had to be moved when the lease ran out two years later.

 . In many cases this has not been realised because of poor handling of programming and debugging tools. In this article we describe a way for building a decentralised automation architecture which is suitable for small up to large projects. Modern number crunchers used for weather forecast or understanding the human gene code are all based on multiprocessing systems with dozens to thousands of processors. The crucial point of such systems is how to organise the data exchange between the processors and how to organise the programming, i.</td>
