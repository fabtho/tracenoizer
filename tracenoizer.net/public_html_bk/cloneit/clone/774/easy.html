Beck IPC has developed a complete Ethernet based concept that makes distribution of programs to decentralised controllers as easy and simple as possible. The Hardware Any CPU made by Beck is PC based and is either extendable with an Ethernet module or has Ethernet integrated. Between these are a number of different CPUs of different capacity.</td>
