 . chat with the Wilson-Sims family (September 16, 1999). AN AMERICAN LOVE STORY is the story of Bill Sims and Karen Wilson -- a black man and white woman who have struggled for 30 years against the racial stereotypes and societal prejudices that have tried -- sometimes viciously -- to divide them. The series ran from Sunday, September 12, 1999 through Thursday, September 16 on PBS stations nationwide. Your local public TV station may schedule repeat broadcasts, so check the ITVS database to find out if it's scheduled in your area.</td>

 The lyrics are often clever and the melodies hummable. The sincere power of this pop is at first reminiscent of great live bands such as The Knack and The Smithereens, until the vocals change the scape. Up front and personal, the vocals in Ten Story Love are hard to categorize. Their sound is accessible and familiar but not unoriginal by any stretch. If you see their name in a band lineup at your local club, turn off the t.</td>
