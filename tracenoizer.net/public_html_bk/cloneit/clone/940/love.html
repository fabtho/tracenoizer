 . All Monkey wants to know is when the Recording Industry will realize it is HIS bitch. That's because Ten Story Love, a New England-based rock quartet, plays the same type of overly-happy pop rock on its debut album that you hear used as sitcom theme songs on shows like Friends and Jesse. This is the type of music which has very little lasting value, but corporations like to use it because it's upbeat, inoffensive, and catchy (in a very annoying way). This music just makes you want to sway back and forth with a big, dumb, mindless smile on your face.</td>
