 If the directions are not strictly complied with the application will be treated as invalid. For instance, the forms require that where an applicant is required to provide evidence of funds "original bank statements must be submitted or copies that must be certified by the bank or financial institution", photocopies will not suffice. In addition, application forms should be submitted to the Home Office one month before the applicant's current permission to remain in the UK expires. This will hopefully allow sufficient time for a reapplication to be made to the Home Office prior to the expiration of existing leave in the event of them determining that the application is invalid. If an application is out of time once it has eventually been made validly, the consequence is that if it is refused, valuable rights to appeal against a refusal decision will be lost (although the immigration appellate authorities are becoming increasingly aware of the harshness of this practice and have in one case taken a lenient stance).</td>
