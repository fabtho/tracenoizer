 .edu LAS CRUCES -- Horticulture students from New Mexico State University had little time to stop and smell the flowers earlier this month at the Floral Crops Quality Evaluation and Design Competition in Sioux Falls, S. In the national contest, NMSU's floral design students had one hour to create finished corsages and arrangements, while judging team members had just three minutes to scrutinize and rank each table of four plants in the 30-category contest. Though the competition was tough, four NMSU design contestants placed and the judging team gained valuable experience, said Geno Picchioni, the group's coach and NMSU assistant horticulture professor. "I think one of the biggest and best outcomes of this exercise is that they sharpen up their on-their-feet skills and critical thinking skills that we really don't do enough of in the classroom," he said.</td>

 Rogers said the project will benefit the students in their careers because they learned to work cooperatively in a global context. It also allowed them to examine the impact of the emerging global culture of tourism on regional and local societies and the built form. Because this project was team-based, it gave them a more realistic idea of what to expect in their professional life. ..</td>

 The undergraduate students talked to physicians to learn about diseases such as cerebral palsy, spina bifida, muscular dystrophy and rheumatoid arthritis. Students then examined the needs and the abilities of children who have the diseases in order to develop recreational devices they could use. So Kan and his team created a vehicle that allows children to enjoy the freedom of riding without the strain on their hips from pedaling. Other student-engineered projects included a climbing wall for children with spina bifida and a stretching easel that would help provide stretching exercises for children with muscular dystrophy. One team created an adaptable chair that could be attached to regular playground equipment so children with cerebral palsy could enjoy tire swings and merry-go-rounds.</td>
