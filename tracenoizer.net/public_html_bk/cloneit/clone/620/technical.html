 And why should they even want to go to computer fairs like SIGGRAPH, where mostly commercial products are introduced anyway. What is the biggest deal at SIGGRAPH that might interest women. More to your question, one of the most female orientated topics seems to be VRML and avatar development, because it gives the possibililty not only for technical, but also for social construction. I was happy to meet Wendy Sue Noah in person at their meeting. The consortium held one of the first panels at SIGGRAPH, which was a real interactive experience.</td>

 As one possibility out of many tele-learning solutions virtual seminars are developing towards a wide-spread and accepted instructional choice in universities and adult education. The first evaluative studies report problems as well. HESSE and GIOVIS (1997) state low participation rates, REIMANN (1998) mentions technical difficulties concerning hard- and software, NISTOR and MANDL (1995) report the heavy load on cognitive resources and UTZ and SASSENBERG (1999) found high drop-out rates as central points of difficulty. UTZ and SASSENBERG (1999) showed, too, that high identification with a virtual seminar proves to be a solution for some of the above mentioned problems. One field that is not covered at all in studies on virtual seminars, due to a lack of acknowledged influence, is the media-typical style of interaction, in other words the specific character of computer-mediated communication (CMC).</td>

 We cannot build up a complete network of our own, or internet or electronic intranet. It would remain a getto which has a different electronic standard then the electronic realities. So my idea is a bit in this coyote direction that I mentioned, that we have to deal with the existing male technical standards, but try to do it in a subversive, mannerist way. This we can express best maybe with some visual or materializing projects, that makes these structures it has somehow for us possible to experience. Creating new, using the existing parts and give certain abuses, that are not intentionally sought by the set up networks now, is what I aim for.</td>
