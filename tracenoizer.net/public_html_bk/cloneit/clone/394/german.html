(Kwon Eun-Sun) ___ Director ___ Ulrike Ottinger Ottinger started her film career in 1972 and is considered one of the most important women directors of the New German Cinema. Her signature mark is the bestowing of desires, dreams and fears onto brilliant visual styles with a realistic aura. Besides fantastic films like Freak Orlando, Ottinger has also worked on documentaries such as Count Down which deals with the division and unification of Germany.</td><td valign="bottom"><img height="374" width="270" src="http://www.meerapfel.de//pictures/AnnasS.jpg"></td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2"><td valign="center"><img height="275" width="400" src="http://www.bayerntours.com/regen/frauenau/haus/waldesruh/haus2.jpg"></td><td valign="center"> Marcia Pally, February 2001 Filmography Bibliography . ., German with English, French and Spanish subtitles.
