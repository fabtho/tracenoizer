 Here there are classes of problems that are intrinsically harder than others. . Wolpert We address the question "Are some classes of combinatorial optimization problems instrinsically harder than others, without regard to the algorithm one uses, or can difficulty only be assessed relative to particular algorithms. " We provide a measure of the hardness of a particular optimization problem for a particular optimization algorithm. We then present two algorithm-independent quantities that use this measure to provide answers to our question.</td>

 Can anyone suggest a decent low degree rational function approximation for tanh. . Several of our applications, notably MacNeal-Schwendler finite element analysis, Genome Thereputics neural network training, and GE Medical Systems ODE parameter identification seem to be giving rise to optimization problems that take GlobSol longer than we might expect. This is the only thing that makes this problem non-linear. "Training" means that we should adjust the parameters a so that NN (x(.</td>

 . Some Anomalous Results and Their Explanation - Forrest, Mitchell (ResearchIndex) A. This question has become increasingly important as people have tried to apply the GA to ever more diverse types of problems. Much previous work on this question has studied the relationship between GA performance and the structure of a given fitness function when it is is expressed as a Walsh polynomial. The work of Bethke, Goldberg, and others has produced certain theoretical results about this relationship.</td>
