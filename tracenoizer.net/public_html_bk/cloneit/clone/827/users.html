<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" (We'll set one up for you) View my Wish List Windows Nt User Administration by Ashley J. com Windows NT's user-management tools can prove confusing, but this guide does a good job of explaining them. Taking a sort of God-and-humankind approach to the relationship between system administrators and users (an appropriate analogy), authors Meggitt and Ritchey first describe the basic formula that you can use to get users up and running under Windows NT. They also tell how to keep an eye on users, providing a good analysis of the contents and formats of the various log files. The authors explain how to use the command shell to accomplish important administration tasks--an important thing to understand, since it's much easier, for instance, to automate the creation of many accounts that way.">

The format is netname, one space, secretkey, one newline.</td>
