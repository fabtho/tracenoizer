After an uprising against Chinese rule 42 years ago, the Dalai Lama fled, followed by thousands of Tibetans.

 Tibetan Exiles Say China Has Made Rare Gesture By Jawed Naqvi NEW DELHI, July 15, Reuter -- Pro-independence Tibetan leaders on Thursday hailed a Chinese decision to receive their official delegation as a rare concession that would help improve relations with Beijing. They said Tibet's exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, last weekend sent his brother Gyalo Thondup to Beijing for important talks at the head of an official delegation. Thondup is the Minister for Security in a Tibetan government-in-exile which operates from the northern Indian town of Dharamsala, but which no country recognises. Thondup has been to China several times before, but Beijing treated his visits as private. He had to resign his ministerial post in the government-in-exile before Beijing received him in June last year, but has since returned to the cabinet.</td>
