 If bacteria become resistant (which can occur through the use and overuse of antibiotics), the antibiotics become ineffective. In response to this issue, the Minister for Health and Aged Care and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, jointly established a Joint Expert Technical Advisory Committee on Antibiotic Resistance (JETACAR) in 1998. JETACAR comprised experts from the areas of human health, veterinary medicine and primary industry. It was tasked with assessing the scientific evidence of a link between the use of antibiotics in food-producing animals, the emergence and selection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and their spread to humans, and to recommend future risk management strategies. The Government released the JETACAR report on 22 October 1999.</td>
