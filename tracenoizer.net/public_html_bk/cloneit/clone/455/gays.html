 Over 400 000 participants took part in the Gay Pride Parade last year. On the 23rd June 2001 over half a million people are expected to take part in the colourful parade with around 80 decorated floats which weave their way over eight kilometres through the streets of Berlin. With the CSD parade this year the gays and lesbians will make their political standpoint even more evident than ever before. Many of Berlin's gay and lesbian organisations came up with the motto for this years - " Berlin stands up against the "right". and as such display their opposition to the stream of right wing extremists, who not only oppose people without German origin living here but also minority groups such as gays and lesbians.</td>
