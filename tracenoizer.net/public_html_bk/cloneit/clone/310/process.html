 In 1996 we launched the Journal's website with an experiment in using the Internet to open up peer review. In seven instances, this led to further revision of the articles before they were published in print. Nonetheless, the study suggested that most authors and reviewers are willing to explore more open methods of peer review and that the Internet can be used to enhance peer review while accelerating the publication process. After due consideration, we are launching another study to test a more open peer review process that is entirely based on the Internet. This study will enlist 50-60 articles over the next six to 12 months.</td>
