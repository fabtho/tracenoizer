 Support independent film and your local music scene. . Firewater Films was founded in September of 1998, with the purpose of using the former adult movie houses in Times Square as screening centers for what is now the calling card of a new generation of filmmakers -- the short film. Providing a forum created by filmmakers for filmmakers and their audiences, the Firewater series is keeping experimental and independent art alive in the heart of the city. Firewater is bringing back the short film, recognizing the short as a viable entertainment form on its own and offering the public the chance to enjoy its innovation and variety.</td>
