 . This list comprises all of the manufacturers of which I am aware. These are companies whose primary or sole product(s) is residential geodesic dome homes, or smaller geodesic dome structures for the yard. If you are seeking information on commercial domes or products, Joe Moore and Kirby Ulner also provide lists which may include commercial vendors of dome related products. Please be sure that the products are true geodesic dome products, and not simply a somewhat dome-shaped product.</td>

 net Before sending me E-mail, please read the disclaimer page. . These pages are for the purpose of bringing together (as much as is possible) the information available on geodesic domes and current suppliers of geodesic dome homes and yard structures. If you need this kind of list, Joe Moore or Kirby Urner have lists that provide this type of information. As these are my personal web pages, there are certain things that you must know about these pages, and what I view are my responsibilities concerning them.</td>

 But Fuller's designs encountered resistance from purely profit-driven corporations, whose destructive legacies he would spend the next fifty years fighting. Throughout the 1940s and 1950s, Fuller gained a formidable reputation as an early researcher of renewable energy sources. Navy experiences, he developed tensegrity structures like the Geodesic Dome (minimalist structures that actually get stronger as they get larger), and developed the science of Synergetics, which explores holistic engineering structures in nature (long before the term 'synergy' became popular). Famous Geodesic Dome examples include EPCOT Center at Florida's Disney World and the U. Fuller believed that any true social or political revolution must arise from and encompass design revolution insights, and not just be based upon shallow political rhetoric.</td>
