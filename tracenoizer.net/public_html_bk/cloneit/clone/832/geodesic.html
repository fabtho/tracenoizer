 net Before sending me E-mail, please read the disclaimer page. . These pages are for the purpose of bringing together (as much as is possible) the information available on geodesic domes and current suppliers of geodesic dome homes and yard structures. If you need this kind of list, Joe Moore or Kirby Urner have lists that provide this type of information. As these are my personal web pages, there are certain things that you must know about these pages, and what I view are my responsibilities concerning them.</td>

 . This list comprises all of the manufacturers of which I am aware. These are companies whose primary or sole product(s) is residential geodesic dome homes, or smaller geodesic dome structures for the yard. If you are seeking information on commercial domes or products, Joe Moore and Kirby Ulner also provide lists which may include commercial vendors of dome related products. Please be sure that the products are true geodesic dome products, and not simply a somewhat dome-shaped product.</td>

 This structure is comprised of a complex network of triangles that form a roughly spherical surface. The more complex the network of triangles, the more closely the dome approximates the shape of a true sphere. Each of these lines divide the sphere into two halves, hence the term geodesic, which is from the Latin meaning "earth dividing". There are many sizes of triangles in a geodesic, depending on the frequency of subdivision of the underlying spherical polyhedron. The cross section of a geodesic approximates a great-circle line.</td>
