 net Before sending me E-mail, please read the disclaimer page. . These pages are for the purpose of bringing together (as much as is possible) the information available on geodesic domes and current suppliers of geodesic dome homes and yard structures. If you need this kind of list, Joe Moore or Kirby Urner have lists that provide this type of information. As these are my personal web pages, there are certain things that you must know about these pages, and what I view are my responsibilities concerning them.</td>

 . This list comprises all of the manufacturers of which I am aware. These are companies whose primary or sole product(s) is residential geodesic dome homes, or smaller geodesic dome structures for the yard. If you are seeking information on commercial domes or products, Joe Moore and Kirby Ulner also provide lists which may include commercial vendors of dome related products. Please be sure that the products are true geodesic dome products, and not simply a somewhat dome-shaped product.</td>

 Fuller then moved on to consider other innovations that could benefit humanity in the areas of structure and housing. He also returned to his less pragmatic quest to discover nature's coordinate system and employ that system in a structure that would, because it was based on natural rather than humanly developed principles, be extremely efficient. That structure is the geodesic dome, which, because it approximates a sphere, encloses much more space with far less material than conventional buildings. In order to uncover nature's coordinate system, Fuller retreated from a great deal of his usual activities during 1947 and 1948. He chose that area because he felt it would be most useful in further understanding the mathematics of engineering, in discovering nature's coordinate system, and eventually in building the spherical structures that he found to be the most efficient means of construction.</td>
