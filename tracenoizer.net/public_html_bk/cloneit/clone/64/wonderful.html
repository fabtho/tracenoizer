 This book needs a major rewrite if it is to become useful and provide guidance to building USEFUL websites Was this review helpful to you. I have a small web design business and have several books on design and web design. THIS book is wonderful at covering the business aspect of the process and has saved us hours and shortened the learning curve of how to manage a project and how to deal with clients. Some points they bring up we had thought about but others we hadn't and this book brought them to our attention. We are using several of their ideas and plan on implementing others.</td>

" At least the teacher wrote that we at Massachusetts News are "very talented.</td>

 Our congressional delegation consistently votes down party lines. Anybody with the name Kennedy gets elected to whatever they run for. Weld and Cellucci were wonderful alternatives to what we usually get. Silber would have been a welcome change but Weld narrowly beat him. She's been the target of lots of grief - much of it undeserved.</td>
