Starting with a primordial ooze of thousands of randomly created computer programs, a population of programs is progressively evolved over many generations using the Darwinian principle of survival of the fittest, a sexual recombination operation, and occasional mutation. This second annual conference in 1997 reflects the rapid growth of this field in which over 600 technical papers have been published since 1992.</td>

 If you don't already know HTML, this book isn't going to help you. The best part for me was advice on rendering text in photoshop, along with good explanations on how to get the most our of your image colors for web sites - a difficult thing to do. Also of note is the advice the book gives on site construction. Finally, from a creative standpoint, it really gives some good ideas on what you can do on the web.
