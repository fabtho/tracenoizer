 Because of other events held in the area during the summer, attendees are urged to make their arrangements for accomodations early. Make your reservations directly with the Stanford Terrace Inn before June 11, 1997. There is a free Stanford University shuttle (called Marguerite) that stops near both of these hotels (and various other hotels, the train station, and Palo Alto locations). The final deadline for University housing applications is June 13, 1997. See the GP-97 WWW home page for a university housing application form.</td>

 Parents groups were yelling about this stuff way before it happened. Cellucci did nothing afterward when the admin was shown what went on there. Later, it got out in Massnews and nightly on a Boston radio station-- THEN there were some firings and a resignation but Cellucci never said a public word about it. Cellucci has a gay adviser who is arrogant as hell when people call him. She's been the target of lots of grief - much of it undeserved.</td>
