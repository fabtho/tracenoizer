Starting with a primordial ooze of thousands of randomly created computer programs, a population of programs is progressively evolved over many generations using the Darwinian principle of survival of the fittest, a sexual recombination operation, and occasional mutation. This second annual conference in 1997 reflects the rapid growth of this field in which over 600 technical papers have been published since 1992.</td>
