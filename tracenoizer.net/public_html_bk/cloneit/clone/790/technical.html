 It is hoped to help compensate for the reduction of personnel authorized to the Ground Self Defense Force (GSDF). This new SAM development plan joins the plans for mass production of the advanced "FS-X" fighter support aircraft as highlights of the New Mid-Term Defense Buildup Program that is to begin in FY96. The Technical Research and Development Institute (TRDI) of the JDA has been working on development of an advanced intermediate range SAM for 7 years as successor to the "Modified Hawk" SAM currently owned by the GSDF. MELCO and Toshiba have been producing the modified Hawk under license from Raytheon in the United States. MELCO, Toshiba, and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) so far have spent approximately 17 billion yen on development of the new SAM, and research necessary for technical demonstration already has been completed.</td>
