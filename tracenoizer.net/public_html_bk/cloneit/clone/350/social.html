 The 1990s have seen a shift in the way in which gender divisions in society are seen, and this is reflected in the current title of the degree. Our course examines the issues that define, support and contain women and men in contemporary society. It aims to provide you with the skills to understand and articulate the nature and forms of gender divisions within contemporary society, and the role of gender in the formation and implementation of social policies. The disciplines of Gender Studies and Social Policy fit well together, and provide a 'natural' and rich area of study. Conversely, social policy has embraced a range of theoretical concerns, among which gender divisions have been central.</td>

They argued that it is important to consider the process of conflict resolution as it may affect the quality of the relationship between the parties involved. The implications are broad and encompass a wide range of social interactions.</td>
