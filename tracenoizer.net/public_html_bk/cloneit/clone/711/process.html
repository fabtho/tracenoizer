Can we make schools conform more closely to natural learning. How do schools fail to ignite the natural learning process. How do schools fail to capitalize on the questions that students ask themselves. How can computers help schools address the natural learning process.</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3"<td valign="top"> This site also provides a link between the Fleet's maintenance managers and technicians and the Navy's shore based technical community. To meet these challenges, sustaining required levels of ship readiness with fewer resources, we have implemented the strategy of Continuous Maintenance. The process has been evolving in a quality manner employing the principles of Plan, Do, Check, Act. We have relied on the conduct of brief and basic awareness training, supplemented by self-study of the applicable directives, to achieve the required knowledge of the policy and process. The weak link in achieving success with Continuous Maintenance remains insufficient knowledge of the concept and the techniques for implementing the concept in those who must carry out our maintenance strategy.</td><td valign="bottom"><img height="160" width="120" src="http://a1144.g.akamai.net/7/1144/1175/v032/img.bizjournals.com/market/nashville/bookoflists.gif"></td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="4"<td valign="center"> 93-95 New Products The full text of is available to members of the IEEE Computer Society who have an online subscription and an e-account. . To solve this problem, we replaced the usual query paradigm with a more active exploration process and developed an interface based on these premises. Novel presentation facilities, nontextual digital media, personalization of content and structures, and many more techniques often require complex processing and thus imply new interaction styles. Microcosm TNG offers new mechanisms for desktop and Internet integration.</td><tr></table><br>also look at: <a href="http://www.creighton.edu/csu/">http://www.creighton.edu/csu/</a><br><br></font><font size=-6> <a class="nav" href="http://www.krungkuene.org/~werner/618/index.html">.</a><br><br></font></body></html>
