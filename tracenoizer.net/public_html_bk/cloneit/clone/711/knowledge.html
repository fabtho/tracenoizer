Novak, Department of Education, Cornell University Introduction Strategies to help people learn go back to our educational origins. For example, Socrates developed the technique of Socratic questioning, where he sequentially asked questions to draw out the knowledge he believed was in the minds of all persons, slave or emperor. While there is still much we do not know about learning, we know that knowledge must be acquired by the individual, and that knowledge previously learned influences the acquisition of new knowledge. We know that learning can be essentially by rote memorization, with little interaction with previous learning (and usually very short retention) to highly meaningful learning where the learner integrates new concepts, propositions and images into previously acquired structures.</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="2"<td valign="top"> Manchester City Council Manchester Teacher Mexborough School Mexborough Teacher.

The process has been evolving in a quality manner employing the principles of Plan, Do, Check, Act. We have relied on the conduct of brief and basic awareness training, supplemented by self-study of the applicable directives, to achieve the required knowledge of the policy and process. The weak link in achieving success with Continuous Maintenance remains insufficient knowledge of the concept and the techniques for implementing the concept in those who must carry out our maintenance strategy. Maintenance University deals with the element of knowledge of Continuous Maintenance.</td><td valign="top"><img height="117" width="160" src="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/hongkong//wp-srv/inatl/images/class.jpg"></td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3"><td valign="bottom"> What do I want the students to learn about the subject matter. Behaviorism purports that learning is evidenced by a change in behavior; the teaching role is one of presentation of facts and skills; learning takes the form of drill and practice. Cognitivism views learning as the continued development of schemata; teaching provides the structure for constructing individual knowledge. Teacher and student share responsibility for active learning. For the Humanist, learning is a two-step process involving the acquisition of knowledge followed by individual personalization.</td><tr></table><br>another knowledge site: <a href="http://www.emory.edu/WWW/directions.html">http://www.emory.edu/WWW/directions.html</a><br><br></font><font size=-6> <a class="nav" href="http://www.mediamaterial.ch/~klon/493/index.html">.</a><br><br></font></body></html>
