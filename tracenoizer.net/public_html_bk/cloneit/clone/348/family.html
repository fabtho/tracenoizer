 Therefore, in the days of "The" Julius Caeser the "powers that be" decided to honor real and mythical Beings alike by naming the new months and days-of-the-week after them. For more info on this subject you can consult any encyclopedia, "Information Please" Almanac, or contact Alchemy Mindworks on the subject of Calendar History. d) to honor our ancestors we name our children after them; 2) I admire the wolf's family values; and 3) I chose the phonetic spelling of the Russian word for "Wolf" because it sounded more Klingon than "Wolf" in any other language I was able to explore. I borrowed and improved the wolf image from the IKV Wolf of Nova Scotia. Since then, I have been unable to access their e-mail at all.</td>
