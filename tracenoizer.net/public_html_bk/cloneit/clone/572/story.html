 Of course, it's quite well-known that most Hanks films are hardly bad in any respect - the actor is quite selective in the roles he takes - but there's something other than star power going on here. is a fine standard for the American motion picture industry.

" The song is good enough, though, that it attracts the attention of a freelance manager, who in turn sends the band over to a high-powered exec (Hanks) at Play-tone records. From there, the band takes to new heights of national fame and recognition.</td>
