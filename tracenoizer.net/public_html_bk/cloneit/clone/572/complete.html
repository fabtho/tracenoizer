 During Zahn's one-year term, the society will work to develop a national office in Washington, D. ; create an on-line journal as a clearinghouse for research findings; establish a public policy statement on youth and crime; and develop a code of ethics for reporting on crime research. Zahn said a committee also will work to complete an oral history of past presidents of the 50-year-old society. Some 3,000 members were expected to attend the San Diego meeting, where Zahn delivered a preliminary report on her ongoing research, "Changing Patterns of Homicide and Social Policy in Three American Cities.

 In response to the accident, regional office management immediately dispatched Mr. Hanable to the field in order to document the agency's role in fighting the ensuing oil spill. Despite the frenzied pace of activity of the next few months, he was able to revise the three chapters he had completed but was unable to complete the remainder of the study. The author was assigned to complete the task which Mr. It was decided to retain the chapters which pertained to fish and bear management (chapter 8 and 9); although the material in those chapters has been somewhat revised, he should be considered the primary author of both.</td>
