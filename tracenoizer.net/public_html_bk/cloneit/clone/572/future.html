 (made into the movie Soylent Green) and, most recently, Stars And Stripes Forever, the first in a new alternate history series. His books have been translated into 27 languages, including that perennial favorite, Esperanto. We spoke with him recently about his distinguished career, his memories of the past and thoughts of the future, his long love affair with alternate history, and cannibalism. and Astounding--was there a sense among the people involved that you were creating something special and important, making up the Golden Age as you went along.

 As both humans and the alien Zhirrzh prepare for all-out galactic war, a handful of individuals from both sides are stunned to discover that the explosive catalyst for the impending battle is a misunderstanding both tragic and profound. Now, he must probe deeply into the world of the invaders themselves in one of the most powerful evocations of an alien society ever created. In a star-faring future, humanity is facing tensions within its own ranks and also with various nonhuman races when an aggressive, militaristic new foe erupts from out of nowhere. The son of a high-ranking statesman is the sole survivor of a space battle, and his father sets out to rescue him from alien captivity. The story proceeds briskly thereafter, thanks to Zahn's usual knack for swift pacing, plausible technology and characters, and a lived-in setting.</td>
