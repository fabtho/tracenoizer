 MLUG HUMOR If you want to see a new joke press reload on you browser. . Linux is different from other operating systems in how it separates user space(places were you can write data, save files to, and configure to your preferances) from system space ( places were files important to proper computer fuctioning reside). This makes linux very robust and less vulnerable to virus and arbitrary code execution attacks on the system. The multi user architecture keeps your data safe from the eyes of other users who might have access to the machine.</td>

 .00 PM, defunct processes start appearing on the Unix Server. Whenever an user exits from a session the process ( while he was in the session ) becomes a defunct. In about an hour the number of defunct process increase to thousands and we have to shut down the system totally and reboot. I have verified the Background Unix process before the defunct process start and after the same and have found no new process getting started by Unix in the Background.</td>
