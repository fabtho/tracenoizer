 I have verified the Background Unix process before the defunct process start and after the same and have found no new process getting started by Unix in the Background. .00 PM, defunct processes start appearing on the Unix Server. Whenever an user exits from a session the process ( while he was in the session ) becomes a defunct. In about an hour the number of defunct process increase to thousands and we have to shut down the system totally and reboot.</td>

 We've touched on this option in the past, but will cover it in more detail this time around, with special emphasis on its use by the more mobile notebook PC user. Cacheing by any other name Offline Files is solely a Windows 2000 option and to use it you will need two things. The required software is installed by default in both cases when Windows 2000 is loaded, but you need to take several steps at both the server and client ends to make use of it. On the server you start out by selecting a folder or file to be made available through Offline Files, opening its associated Properties window and going to the Sharing tab. Here, along with the normal file sharing options, you'll find a button marked Caching, which is what's used to set up the Offline Files option.</td>
