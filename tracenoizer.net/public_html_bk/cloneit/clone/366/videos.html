 Those seeking membership must demonstrate a keen interest in the art and perform either Stage or Close-up magic before the Executive Committee, or otherwise prove their genuine interest. Members are informed of Local, National and International magical events through the monthly society newsletter, "Magic-Makers". The ASM library is one of the most comprehensive in the Southern Hemisphere, containing both historical and contemporary works, with some of the most treasured books and videos. Competitions are conducted in which members compete for trophies and awards. Two of the most prestigious trophies are "The Levante Shield", presented to the society by The Great Levante in 1954 for the best stage performer and "The Selwyn Silver Salver" which was donated in memory of Tom Selwyn for the best manipulation act.</td>
