 Today both Germany and Italy offer a range of different design trends, as the understated elegance of new modesty and the back-to-nature philosphy of ecological design develop in parallel with bright colours, pale wood and new man-made materials. Who can now tell the difference between German and Italian design. When Antonio Citterio and Mario Bellini design furniture for Vitra, Matteo Thun designs a coffee pot for WMF and Michele De Lucchi is commissioned by Interluebke, it hardly seems appropriate to speak of German design. Similarly, Werner Aisslinger, Konstantin Grcic and Richard Sapper's designs for Cappellini, Driade and Alessi respectively can't really be classified as Italian. National differences become blurred when designers and manufacturers collaborate across national frontiers.</td>

 Mars 73 addresses his part of the platform to children. Bryom 88 tells the story of his young life as a graffiti artist. Tack designs a scene combining pieces from a realistic and a fantastic world. Crash brings back into the public space popular icons that artists like Roy Lichtenstein put into the museum. In addition, Lee's car scenes, as all other aspects, are part of a repertoire of paintings that is deeply rooted in the visual memory of our collective memory.</td>

 Do not burden future generations with requirements for maintenance or vigilant administration of potential danger due to the careless creation of products, processes or standards. Evaluate and optimize the full life-cycle of products and processes, to approach the state of natural systems, in which there is no waste. Human designs should, like the living world, derive their creative forces from perpetual solar income. Incorporate this energy efficiently and safely for responsible use. No human creation lasts forever and design does not solve all problems.</td>
