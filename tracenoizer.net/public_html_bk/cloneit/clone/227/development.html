 By choosing "Humanity, Nature, and Technology" as the theme for EXPO 2000, the city has decided to directly address the difficult issue of imagining and encouraging a sustainable future. Ideally, humanity will redefine itself, its placement in nature, and refine the role of technology within the environment. In order to insure that the design and construction related to the fair will represent sustainable development for the city, region, and world, the City of Hannover has commissioned "The Hannover Principles" to inform the international design competitions for EXPO 2000. The Principles are to be considered by designers, planners, government officials and all involved in setting priorities for t he built environment. They will help form the foundations of a new design philosophy underlying the future of proposed systems and construction for the City, its region, its global neighbors and partners in the world exposition.</td>

 Staff from both institutions plan, manage and teach (side-by-side in the studio) the total course. Students develop and discuss their work in functional and aesthetic terms, and provide design solutions to meet the performance and emotional needs of the product user. In the final years each student puts forward a programme of individual product development, testing and prototyping, often with an industrial partner. The course is supported by an Industrial Liaison Board. - academic links Students usually make a study tour to a major centre of excellence in the UK or abroad in their fourth year.</td>
