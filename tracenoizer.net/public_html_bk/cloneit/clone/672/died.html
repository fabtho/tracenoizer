 A very thorough inspection of the French and German works on Heraldry in Philadelphia and New York Libraries failed to disclose the name Gornussin. It was probably an affix, and a corruption of "garnichts thun," complete idleuess, to deuote aristocratic birth as distinguished from an origin plebeian. Contler died March 22, 1831, aged 84 years and 9 months. nckel Coat of Arms represents three heads and sheaves of wheat on a shield, with a coat of armor above, surmounted by three heads and sheaves of wheat.

While in Erfurt he taught Johann Christoph Bach, Sebastian's older brother and guardian in Ohrdruf when the Bach parents died. In 1690 Pachelbel became court organist at Stuttgart. Two years later Johann took his final post, in Nuremburg.</td>

 At the same time, remember that the heart is sometimes wiser than the head. Keep preoccupied with a profession whatever it might be. Many a rich man has died poor in spirit caused by the chains of his debts. Keep your thoughts honest, and your actions will follow accordingly. Keep your perspective and rely on family and friends when your spirit is diminished.</td>
