 The Swiss Family Robinson became public domain late in the 19th century, which explains why it's available in so many editions, and also why it's considered fair game for any sort of adaptation into other media, and into other adventure story genres . . It began life as a manuscript story about a shipwrecked family that Johann David Wyss (1743-1818), a Swiss clergyman of Bern, read to his four sons. His son Johann Rudolf Wyss (1781-1830) established himself as a noted writer, philosopher and Swiss folklorist after graduating from university, and eventually adapted his father's manuscript into a novel. The original Swiss edition, in German, was published in 1812 under the title Der Schweizerische Robinson, Oder der Schiffbruchige Schweizerprediger und Seine Familie.</td>

 The Grolimunds came to America from Switzerland by way of Germany, France, etc. Combine the two meanings and maybe "BIG MOUTH" will fit, also. See Alois' story of "Schwarzbubenland", The Land of the Black Boys. The original of this chart is from Carlos's wife, Claudia, with help from Uncle Paco (Francisco), and some input from Alois in Switzerland. Tio Paco is working with Alois on more of the history.</td>

 Eventually, he leads a rebellion against Akela, the pack's aging leader and attacks Mowgli, who beats him away with a burning firebrand. In these and the several other Mowgli stories--there are some prequels--Kipling strikes a nice balance between anthropomorphizing the animals and understanding Mowgli's natural superiority. Also appearing in this collection is a story I've loved since I first saw the Classic Cartoon version--Rikki Tikki Tavi. It tells the story of an intrepid young mongoose and his life or death battle to protect an Indian villa from a couple of particularly unpleasant cobras. Rikki Tikki Tavi has always seemed to me to be one of the great heroes in all of literature.</td>
