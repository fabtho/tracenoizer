 The Swiss Family Robinson became public domain late in the 19th century, which explains why it's available in so many editions, and also why it's considered fair game for any sort of adaptation into other media, and into other adventure story genres . . It began life as a manuscript story about a shipwrecked family that Johann David Wyss (1743-1818), a Swiss clergyman of Bern, read to his four sons. His son Johann Rudolf Wyss (1781-1830) established himself as a noted writer, philosopher and Swiss folklorist after graduating from university, and eventually adapted his father's manuscript into a novel. The original Swiss edition, in German, was published in 1812 under the title Der Schweizerische Robinson, Oder der Schiffbruchige Schweizerprediger und Seine Familie.</td>

 . Always good to get back to one's nest after a long, hard day, isn't it. My deluxe penthouse nest at the Swiss Family Treehouse may look good from the outside, but I'm not too happy there. I was sitting on my sofa on a Sunday afternoon when she came to collect the rent wearing some kinky outfit from Friedrick's of Geneva, with her hair in pigtails, and said she wanted to be my Swiss Miss, and I could be her hot cocoa. Then she said she wanted to put me in her pantry with her cupcakes.</td>
