 Teaching New Articial Intelligence using Constructionist. . The model-composition problem in user-interface generation (ResearchIndex) A. The model-composition problem is concerned with automatically synthesizing powerful, correct, and efficient user interfaces from multiple models specified in different notations. Solutions to the model composition problem must balance the advantages of separating code generation into specialized code generators each able to take advantage of deep, model-specific knowledge against the correctness and efficiency obstacles that result from such.</td>
