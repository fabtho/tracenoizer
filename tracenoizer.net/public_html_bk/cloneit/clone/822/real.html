 Request More Information Transaction Server Video by Keystone Top Trainers KeyStone trainers are professional, experienced software teachers -- not actors or cue-card readers. Many are certified, or course writers, designers and developers, and authors of articles and books on software and adult learning. KeyStone instructors know how to stimulate comprehension and retention, while communicating real-world information. Since KeyStone trainers have spent hundreds of hours working with the software they teach, they can share tips and tricks, and point out shortcuts that are learned only through experience.
