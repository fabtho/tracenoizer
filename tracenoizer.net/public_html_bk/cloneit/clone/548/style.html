 The Design Poster After World War I, the Swiss came to the fore in graphic design, a new discipline required to meet the needs of the machine age. The Swiss readily absorbed its principles from the Russian Constructivists, the Dutch De Stijl movement, and the experiments at the Bauhaus. The key figure in Switzerland was Ernst Keller, who began teaching at the Design School in Zurich in 1918, and mentored the generation of artists who would create the world leading International Typographic Style after World War II. In 1923 Otto Baumberger completed an object poster masterpiece for PKZ. The poster was a drawing of a life-size coat with wool fibers, silk lining and PKZ label so realistic that most viewers assumed it was a photograph.</td>

 Swiss posters Emil Cardinaux was one of the first Swiss painters to turn his hand to poster art. The latter was made possible by lithographic standards that were the envy of other designers all over the world. The photographic poster and the International Typographic Style The development of the photographic poster around 1940 and the playful whimsicality of the typographic poster in the 1960s are clear indications of the inroads made by graphic design. The typographic austerity typical of styles in the 60s and 70s bore the stamp of designers like Josef Mueller-Brockmann, Armin Hofmann and Ernst Keller and soon established itself as the leading graphic design style of the postmodernist era. Graphic design and the modern poster The dogmatic formality of the International Style began to lose momentum in the 80s and was replaced by the excitingly original work of poster designers like Wolfgang Weingart and the Zurich design team of Rosmarie Tissi and Siegfried Odermatt.</td>
