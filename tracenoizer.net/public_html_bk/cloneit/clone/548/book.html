 (We'll set one up for you) View my Wish List A History of Graphic Design by Philip B. it will be an eye-opener not only for general readers, but for designers who have been unaware of their legacy. Critique Magazine, Pamela Williams, Spring 1997 With this book, Meggs made it easier for designers to envision their work in terms of history. The final pages of each edition attempt to put young designers into historical context, perhaps before their influence can be accurately assessed. Although some may argue that it's an effort to control history rather than report it, this book makes for a lively debate.</td>

 They painted Bruce Willis like a John Singer Sargent portrait. Movie posters speak about the movie but they also speak about the artist, and that isn't highlighted as much as it probably should be. That is why Graham Marsh's book "Film Poster of the 60s" is a delightful book. A perfect coffee table book gift for movie fans or graphic designers, "Film Posters of the 60s" runs the gamut of all the movies we remember, know, and love. There's Frank Sinatra and the gang in "Ocean's Eleven.</td>

 Lucid and unpretentious, Koren never fails to go directly to the heart of the matter. BISGAARD, SOEN (see more about me) from Kyoto, Japan I have studied Japanese tea ceremony in Kyoto for 23 years and during that time read almost everything published in English on the subject. This book is a real pearl, and covers in all its shortness the subject so well, that you hardly need any other information to transform your life into something more beautiful and meaningful. It is a must for people directly involved with tea and Japanese aesthetics. It is a clear spring of sweet water that will quench the thirst of everyone.</td>
