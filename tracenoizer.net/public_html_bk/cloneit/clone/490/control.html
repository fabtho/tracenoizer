 Moreover, these networks will have to do so while providing a guaranteed performance or quality-of-service (QOS) to these traffic classes. The problem of characterizing performance in such networks is thus particularly important since this must be done not only for the traditional off-line tasks of dimensioning and design (e. , determining link bandwidths, buffer capacities and processing capacities at network switchpoints) but also for on-line, performance-driven traffic control purposes such as session-level admission control. In this section, we outline our research aimed at providing the analytical tools and techniques for analyzing such networks and their diverse workloads and for designing and characterizing the properties of scheduling policies in these networks. Traditional approaches towards performance evaluation of communication networks are generally not applicable in a high-speed network environment for a number of reasons.</td>

 The computation of the final time step plays a special role in determining the computed derivatives. In general, though, the automatic differentiation of sophisticated numerical integrators requires some care. In particular, Eberhard and Bischof (1996) showed that for integrators with adaptive stepsize control (such as LSODE) some postprocessing may be required to recover the.
