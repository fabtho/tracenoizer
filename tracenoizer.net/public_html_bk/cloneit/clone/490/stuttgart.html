 Please call me at the university phone extension -3799 for an appointment, from outside you need to dial (0711) 685-3799. Paid positions as research assistants are sometimes also available. I'm a postdoc at the Institute of Statics and Dynamics of Aerospace Structures (ISD) at the University of Stuttgart, Germany, and primus inter pares of the in 1994 founded Pi-Group at our institute. Our group is named after the so-called Pi-Theorem of similarity theory in physics. The name Pi-Group comes from the fact that the mathematical technique of the Pi-Theorem of physics is one of the main foundations of our research.</td>
