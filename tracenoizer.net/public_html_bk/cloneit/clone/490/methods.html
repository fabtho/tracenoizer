Institute for Computer Applications III Universitaet Stuttgart ICA III Institute for Computer Applications Numerical Methods for High Performance Computing Prof. de Our main interests are numerical methods for partial differential equations. We realized many applications in the program UG which provides a general framework of multilevel method on locally refined grids.</td>

 .) scale with the 5th to 7th order of the molecular size. In order to diminish this unphysically steep scaling Pulay and Saebo introduced the local correlation methods. In these methods the local character of electron correlation is utilized. In our implementation the occupied space is given by localized orbitals which can be obtained from standard procedures as for instance the Boys, Pipek-Mezey or Edmiston-Ruedenberg localizations.</td>
