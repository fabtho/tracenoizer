 . nicole's home sweet homepage at the moment, my page looks really crappy if you are viewing this with a Mac. So, if you are, please bear with me until I figure out what bone-headed thing I did this time. Well, I am proud to say that I have finally sat down and put my rapidly growing knowledge of HTML to some good use. I thought it was about time that the web was adorned with my likeness.</td>

 Without any doubt I've said and meant and believed all these statements. I feel all this 'love' stuff when practiced without compassion and understanding and acceptance, leaves a space for judgment and dismissal. If, in our 'love thing' view we allow room for measuring, then we are not loving. In many aspects of my life I don't know what I am doing. Daily, I'm growing towards trusting myself more, and I hope practicing love more.</td>
