 I think people started opening up to the possibilities . But with dc Talk, I feel like I have to compromise a little bit and sacrifice what I would normally put down for the sake of a bigger audience.

It makes my need and my hunger for God greater because I realize I really do need God. Trexler III The contents of this electronic publication are protected by U.</td>
