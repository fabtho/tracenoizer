 Because I Love myself, I can be truthful with myself and others. . A place of Love is where I came from, where I am now, and where I will return. Coming into this embodiment, I have had many teachings to learn and many things to do. Love is the essence of all the teachings and all the doing.</td>

 Thank You for your much appreciated and encouraged comments. . Love makes all the difference -- well certainly a huge difference. Without any doubt I've said and meant and believed all these statements. I feel all this 'love' stuff when practiced without compassion and understanding and acceptance, leaves a space for judgment and dismissal.</td>

 As an artist he is defiantly fulfilling, about 11 inches. When you get to sit down and talk to him, which I did for around two hours. To be quite honest, I was making love to him and I felt he was making love to me. I'm not and never will be prejudice and I can't stand to be around anyone who is. I have been very busy these days shooting contents for the internet.</td>
