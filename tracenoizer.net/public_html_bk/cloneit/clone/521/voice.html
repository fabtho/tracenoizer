<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" It became something that we were drawn to, that every day going to work and being able to sing love songs to somebody is actually quite beautiful. She had to be funny in a physical comedy sense, tragic as well as that, she had to be able to dance and sing and look terrific. So the singing part of it was something that she calls auditioning, but - and it kind of was in the sense that we had to convince each other, that I wanted a actor who could convey emotions through song, not just a big voice. You know, it wasn't about 'I am a singer' so much, as much as you can move someone through voice. She came in New York City in that place we worked in and we took a song like James Bond's Nobody Does It Better which was a curious choice.">

 At the time, the groundbreaking hip hop star was still in the planning stages of her own solo career when she discovered the abundantly talented Nicole. Missy knew from the outset that the young singer had the potential to be a multi-dimensinal performer. I knew automatically that she had a different kind of voice. She came on with this little Mary feel (a reference to superstar Mary J. Blige), but it was like back to the old Mary when she first came up.</td>
