 Yo Tomita Bachhaus Eisenach BachWorks Project by Jim Michmerhuizen Bach Page from The Bach Choir of Bethlehem Bach Plucked. . Bach Johann Sebastian Bach (1685 - 1750) Bach is considered by many to have been the greatest composer in the history of western music. Bach's main achievement lies in his synthesis and advanced development of the primary contrapuntal idiom of the late Baroque, and in the basic tunefullness of his thematic material. Bach is also known for the numerical symbolism and mathematical exactitude which many people have found in his music -- for this, he is often regarded as one of the pinnacle geniuses of western civilization, even by those who are not normally involved with music.</td>
