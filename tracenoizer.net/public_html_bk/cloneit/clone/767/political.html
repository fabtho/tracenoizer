 geert, why be so defensive about the role of intellectuals. after all, the question was where the Sartres, the de Beauvoirs and the Camus' of the digital age are. this is not about empty 15-minute media-stardom, but about people who are able to reflect about the present in a political and historical perspective and who are able to communicate (write. ) their thoughts in a way that makes it possible for others to follow these insights, have new and other ones, construct new political strategies, people who can conduct or participate in a political debate and who will not be afraid to have an influence on the course of history. the captains of industry rarely have any doubts about that, intellectuals mostly do.</td>
