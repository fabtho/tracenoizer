 In addition, in an inclined source the spectral break in the back lobe should be more smeared out, because in the front lobe the time delay from front to back of the source partially compensates for the different distances back from the hotspot. . Extra effects in real sources Extra effects in real sources In addition to the effects considered so far, there are several factors that must be taken into account when studying real sources. Most of these effects are small, and will be hard to measure. This effect can be estimated from the data, as the difference between the spectra from the front and back of the source can be related to the difference between spectra at different points along the source axis, with due allowance for projection effects.</td>
