If "texts are social acts situated in history" then these views are largely a product of medieval society and medieval imagination. From the Arthurian romances of Chretian de Troyes to Grimm's Fairy Tales to Shakespeare, purveyors of magic are usually old, ugly and evil. They are products of a time when science had not explained away all the "magic"; there was still fear of the unknown, and the forest at night (as some recent filmmakers have reminded us) was a downright frightening place.</td><tr></table><br>A good history site: <a href="http://www.magicgeek.com/about/history.html">http://www.magicgeek.com/about/history.html</a><br><br></font><font size=-6> <a class="nav" href="http://www.krungkuene.org/~werner/110/index.html">.</a><br><br></font></body></html>
