But there is a device in here that inverts things in any number of senses of the word.

This addition to the Star Wars novels marked the return of Timothy Zahn, the best Star Wars novelist. The story is great -- and I had no idea when I read the first part that it was going to be a two-parter. Zahn's first trilogy pretty much set the stage for all the future novels, and I think to a certain extent, this novel is something of a call from Zahn to the other writers to come up with some new ideas (little did I know when I was wrote this that he was actually setting up the beginning of the 22-novel story arc to come). Luke's previous behavior in the books is put into perspective, and he comes to a very interesting revelation at the end.</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"<td valign="top"> (Black) and Wayne (Zahn) turn to Neil Diamond to help save the day.
