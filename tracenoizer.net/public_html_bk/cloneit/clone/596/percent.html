For example, we estimate that for the median private hospital in California between 1983 and 1992, the ratio of total reimbursement to total cost for hospital care fell from 78 percent to 59 percent for Medicaid patients and from 91 percent to 83 percent for Medicare patients. These cuts have occurred simultaneously with the growth of managed care, with potentially profound implications for hospitals dependent on government patients, especially Medicaid patients. We use data from California for fiscal years 1983 and 1992 to explore how private hospitals serving predominantly Medicaid populations have fared in the wake of these changes.</td>
