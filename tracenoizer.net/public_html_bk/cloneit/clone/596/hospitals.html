 . For example, we estimate that for the median private hospital in California between 1983 and 1992, the ratio of total reimbursement to total cost for hospital care fell from 78 percent to 59 percent for Medicaid patients and from 91 percent to 83 percent for Medicare patients. These cuts have occurred simultaneously with the growth of managed care, with potentially profound implications for hospitals dependent on government patients, especially Medicaid patients. We use data from California for fiscal years 1983 and 1992 to explore how private hospitals serving predominantly Medicaid populations have fared in the wake of these changes. On average, private hospitals spend about 10 percent of their budgets on Medicaid.</td>

 .The plan was delayed because Congress passed a Medicare law that required the agency to change the way rates are calculated, said Scott Estes, an analyst with Deutsche Banc Alex. The law eliminated an expected 2 percent reduction in reimbursement rates and gave hospitals the option of switching to the new payment system without phasing it in over three years, Estes said. The delay could affect Healthsouth if it lasts more than three months though, because that could force an even longer delay in adding its hospitals to the new payment system, he said. HCFA did not tell Healthsouth when the system would be implemented, McVay said.</td>

For example, the average hospital stay for an operation of the stomach or small intestine ranged from five days to 18 days at the state's 172 hospitals after taking patient risk factors into account. Similarly, risk-adjusted hospital readmission rates for patients with blood clots varied from five to 52 percent. Hospitals rarely receive what they actually charge for medical services because they negotiate discounts with most insurers, meaning they receive often substantially less.</td>
