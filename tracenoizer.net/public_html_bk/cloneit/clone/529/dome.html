He also returned to his less pragmatic quest to discover nature's coordinate system and employ that system in a structure that would, because it was based on natural rather than humanly developed principles, be extremely efficient. That structure is the geodesic dome, which, because it approximates a sphere, encloses much more space with far less material than conventional buildings. In order to uncover nature's coordinate system, Fuller retreated from a great deal of his usual activities during 1947 and 1948. He chose that area because he felt it would be most useful in further understanding the mathematics of engineering, in discovering nature's coordinate system, and eventually in building the spherical structures that he found to be the most efficient means of construction.">

 Let them experiment on their own or direct them to build the model shown here. This activity works best with large groups, so that each kid is only rolling a few tubes. Assign at least one adult "foreperson" to coordinate the dome assembly. Have kids decorate their tubes and attach them to the growing dome with an adult's help. Test the dome's strength by loading the top with magazines.</td>

 He was bankrupt, discredited and jobless, and he had a wife and new-born daughter. On the verge of suicide, it suddenly struck him that his life belonged, not to himself, but to the universe. The geodesic dome is able to cover more space without internal supports than any other enclosure. It becomes proportionally lighter and stronger the larger it is. The geodesic dome is a breakthrough in shelter, not only in cost-effectiveness, but in ease of construction.</td>
