 geodesic or to one of the mailing lists such the one described in section List Geodesic or in the section on Related Mailing Lists. . Introduction Buckminster Fuller (1895-1983) is the renowned inventor of the geodesic dome, the world game, and a new system of mathematics called synergetics. He was a polymath whose writings and lectures touched upon every aspect of the human condition. His greatest writings were Critical Path, Synergetics (2 volumes), and posthumously Cosmography.</td>

 His designs and engineering philosophy are part of the foundation of contemporary high-tech design aesthetics. . Biography Buckminster Fuller and Shoji SadaoBuckminster Fuller invented the geodesic dome, and a wide range of other paradigm-shifting machines and structural systems. He was especially interested in high-strength-to-weight designs, with a maximum of utility for minimum of material. His designs and engineering philosophy are part of the foundation of contemporary high-tech design aesthetics.</td>

 He was bankrupt, discredited and jobless, and he had a wife and new-born daughter. On the verge of suicide, it suddenly struck him that his life belonged, not to himself, but to the universe. The geodesic dome is able to cover more space without internal supports than any other enclosure. It becomes proportionally lighter and stronger the larger it is. The geodesic dome is a breakthrough in shelter, not only in cost-effectiveness, but in ease of construction.</td>
