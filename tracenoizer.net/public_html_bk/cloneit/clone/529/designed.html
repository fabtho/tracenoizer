 In the 1920s in Germany, he championed a stark asymmetrical style of typography associated with the modernist and Bauhaus movements. Later he moved to Switzerland, where in the 1930s he rejected his earlier asymmetric experimentation and returned to classical (often center-aligned) models of typography. In the 1940s Tschichold was a design director for Penguin Books, where he designed the familiar penguin and puffin logos and reconfigured many books to incorporate the golden ratio in their page or text-block proportions. Tschichold is also known for his remarkable typeface design Sabon, which he designed in the 1960s. Tschichold spent many years examining mediaeval and Renaissance manuscripts and printed books to discover the underlying design "canon" governing the size of margins and the harmonious placement of text blocks.</td>

 Born cross-eyed, he was a belligerent youngster, twice kicked out of Harvard. The metal structure hung from a central mast with outer walls of continuous glass, affording maximum design efficiency with minimal materials. Fuller next designed the Dymaxion Car, a sensation when it was demonstrated on city streets and at the Chicago World's Fair in 1933. Because the strange-looking streamlined car rode on three wheels, seated 11 passengers, and got a remarkable 30 miles to the gallon, it promised to revolutionize the auto industry -- until a tragic accident ultimately derailed those plans. The post-war housing shortage strengthened Fuller's resolve to devise affordable housing for everyone.</td>

 In any given typeface, there's a very narrow range of possible spacing between letters that looks right and feels comfortable to read. Ideally, the type designer has chosen the optimum spacing in designing the font, but sometimes a little variation can help. But digital fonts don't always respect the spacing the designer had in mind, particularly when the digital font is an adaptation of a typeface first designed in metal. ) Since the space within a letter and the space around it ought to be in harmony, a thin, light typeface should actually be spaced more loosely than a thick, bold face -- because the open spaces inside a bold letter are actually smaller than the open spaces within a light version of the same letter. The space around the word is related to the space within the word, so it makes sense that a line of type floating in a huge blank space could be letterspaced slightly more loosely than the same line of type tucked snugly into a paragraph.</td>
