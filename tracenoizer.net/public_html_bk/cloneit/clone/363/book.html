 All collections should have some version of Swiss Family Robinson, and this is a good one. (c)AudioFile, Portland, Maine --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title. Book Description THE SWISS FAMILY ROBINSON is a story of family cooperation and mutual support set on an exotic distant island. The tale, the most famous imitation of Defoe's ROBINSON CRUSOE, was concocted by Johann Wyss's father for the enjoyment of his sons. The sons pooled their talents in writing, illustrating and editing to produce this popular classic.</td>

 There is a large cottage industry in the creation of family books - books about a particular surname, the descendants of a particular couple, the ancestors of a particular person. Since these books are usually printed with a very small print run, it's very difficult to get hold of originals. What works in our favor is that the author will usually make sure that libraries in the area discussed by the book get a copy. This means that it's always worthwhile to check around your area to see if someone has already done a lot of the work for you. We've collected together a quick inventory of these family books for some libraries in the Boston to Providence area.</td>
