I went back to Dublin some years later and became an M. Our family spent a pleasant four months in Edinburgh in 1990, where I did a one-term course for teachers. I love reading books as well as features in newspapers, journals and on the internet and do my own scribbling. I am also fond of music, and I play the piano and the violin. I enjoy walking in the Alps and the Jura or near the sea.</td>
