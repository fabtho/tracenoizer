 . The Swiss Family Robinson, by David Wyss The Robinson family lost at sea -- Vroni and the wondrous island Based on The Swiss Family Robinson by David Wyss Publication anecdote Apparently, the publication history for Robinson is a long one, and entirely posthumous. The story was collected together and published by David Wyss's son, Rudolph Wyss, and published for the first time in 1912. The original author did not publish the book himself. The story was one that David Wyss had orally told to children during his lifetime -- many years later his son decided to put it down onto paper.</td>

The five sets of documents brought to India in January had shown Italian businessman Ottavio Quattrocchi and his wife Maria, former Bofors agent Win Chadha, his late wife Kanta and son Harsh as the beneficiaries of the payoffs. Wyss said the Swiss authorities were not concerned about the pace of the CBI investigations in the Bofors case and this would not come in the way of handing over the last set of documents. .</td>
