Aberdeen University WEOI Membership Required Copyright and Bibliographical Information -- ABSTRACT OF ARTICLE -- Summary Points Point 1 The effective pastoral care of families is a corporate communal task which involves critical reflection by the whole congregation on what the church is as a community, the values it holds, the way it sees the world and the types of theology that it seeks to proclaims. Point 2 Effective pastoral care of families involves the building of a specific type of community, which can understand the reality of families. Such a community accepts the inadequacies and contradictions which lie at the heart of many if not most families, and together, seeks to discover ways of bringing healing and growth to all families, but particularly those who are experiencing difficulties.</td>

 This paper is one in a series of occasional papers analyzing the information from these and other sources. Child care expenses may erode the financial benefits of employment, affecting whether a family can "get by" on relatively low earnings without public assistance. The affordability of child care has become an issue for greater numbers of low-income families as millions have left the welfare rolls for employment since the mid-1990s. Child care subsidies are not an entitlement, and not all low-income families receive help. Most families that have left the welfare system and are working are not receiving child care subsidies (Schumacher and Greenberg 1999).</td>
