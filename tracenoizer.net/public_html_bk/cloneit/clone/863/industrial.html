 Includes descriptions of PROSIM, a general purpose process simulation package, and TSWEET, a simulation package specializing in gas sweetening and sulfur recovery processes. CAD Centre at Strathclyde University Describes their research on design methods and computer support of the design process for engineering applications. CAPD - Computer-Aided Process Design Consortium The consortium in Computer-Aided Process Design is an industrial body within the Engineering Design Research Center that deals with the development of methodologies and computer tools for process industries. Computer Aided Process Engineering Research Group Describes mathematical modelling of industrial processes (process modelling and simulation) and the use of computers in design and flowsheeting. Also, advanced theoretical and experimental research into the application of computational and numerical methods to the solution of problems in process design.</td>

 Process Design Manual for Land Application of Sewage Sludge and Domestic Septage Technology Transfer Download Now. At many of these waste sites, remediation of ground water involves extracting the ground water, then treating it by an ex situ treatment process. Although similar compounds and treatment technologies may be involved, the design considerations for ex situ treatment of ground water or leachate differ from those from industrial waste treatment systems because of dilute concentrations of multiple contaminants variable flow rates process-interfering colloids contaminant concentrations that vary over time This manual was developed for reme dial design engineers and regulatory personnel who oversee the ex situ groundwater or leachate treatment efforts of the regulated community. This manual can serve as an initial technology screen ing guide. More importantly, this manual addresses technical considerations important in the design evaluation phase.</td>

 When you graduate, first and foremost you are a product designer. But in addition to mastering the usual product design skills, you will have the added knowledge of how to include sustainability criteria in your designs. Sustainability When we think about the industrial revolution, and the rise of design for manufactured products, one striking fact is the linearity of the system. You will see that almost every product that surrounds you will end up as waste because that is how it is designed. The idea behind sustainability is to try to make our human systems function more like nature's systems, which are balanced and self regenerating so that there is no waste.</td>
