 Rather than giving up RIGHTS, we shoud be giving up wrongs. We must give up wrongs, not rights, for a better society. NATURAL RIGHTS ARE THOSE RIGHTS such as LIFE (from conception), LIBERTY and the PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS e. Hence laws and statutes which vilolate NATURAL RIGHTS, though they have the color of law, are not law but imposters. Constitution was written to protect these NATURAL RIGHTS from being tampered with by legislators.</td>

 In modern times, a king, compelled by his subjects' sword is to abandon any pretension, would be supposed to have ceased to reign; and the express recognition of such a right is that of insurrection has been justly deemed inconsistent with the majority of law. Force was necessary to repel force; and men accustomed to see the king's authority defied by a private riot, were not much shocked when it was resisted in defence of public freedom. It would be a matter of ridiculous supererogation to assert, in a constitution of government, the natural right of men to defend their lives and liberties against private trespassers. Many of these bills of rights also assert the natural right of all men to protect their property-that is, to protect it against the government. It would be unnecessary and silly indeed to assert, in a constitution of government, the natural right of individuals to protect their property against thieves and robbers.</td>
