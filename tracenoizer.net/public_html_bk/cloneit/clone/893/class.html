<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" . CharlesworthOther titles in Cambridge Cultural Social StudiesDescription . SampleDescriptionThis moving and challenging book by Simon Charlesworth deals with the personal consequences of poverty and class and the effects of growing up as part of a poor and stigmatized group. Charlesworth examines these themes by focussing on a particular town - Rotherham - in South Yorkshire, England, and using the personal testimony of disadvantaged people who live there, acquired through recorded interviews and conversations. He applies to these life stories the interpretative tools of philosophy and social theory, drawing in particular on the work of Pierre Bourdieu and Merleau-Ponty, in order to explore the social relations and experiences of a distinct but largely ignored social group.">

 . We have corporate accounts at two hotels, Holiday Inn Express and Best Western, between our home and studio. We shuttle out-of-state students between their hotels and our studio daily for class. One of our past students coined the phrase, "The hardest fun you'll ever have," to describe our Professional Faux class. We do work hard in class, but having fun is listed as one of our Course Objectives.</td>
