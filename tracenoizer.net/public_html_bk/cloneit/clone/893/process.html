 However, if the Board and company decide changes are needed, we help negotiate this delicate matter as quickly and as fairly as possible before the problem can demoralize or damage the company. . We encourage most companies to adopt a formal selection process for senior positions, involving both senior management and external advisors - typically Board members. We are well placed to help in every step of the search process, and we often do. But we also realize that playing an activist role can sometimes make the process unwieldy.</td>

 Provost Peter Lange appointed the renovation committee in August 2000, charging it to think creatively about the nature of library services and facilities at Duke over the next fifteen to twenty years and make recommendations regarding the design and function of Perkins Library. The committee is working with Duke faculty, students, and staff to develop a vision for renovating and reinvigorating Perkins and with architectural consultants to translate this vision into a building program. More information, including opportunities to participate in the planning process, can be found at the committee website. Spanning over 200 years, these books provide a window into the lives and aspirations of all classes of American women. Visit the Center for Women's History and Culture or search the online catalog under subject headings Prescriptive literature and Women--conduct of life.</td>
