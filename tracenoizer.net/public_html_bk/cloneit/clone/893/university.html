 The installation of the University's new seating started 17 August 1998 in four classrooms in order to be ready in time for the beginning of the school year. . Ducharme has won the contract to provide over 500 of the new version of the 7000 SERIES seats to the university in time for the commencement of the school year. Unlike normal contract bidding, the customer had used Ducharme seats before and was delighted with the service and the price, but in this case the university wanted some entirely new characteristics included. Colors were to be vibrant new primaries rather than the traditional somber hues, so rather than use the fiberglass seats of past orders the University has also opted for Ducharme's new blow-molded seat which provides a wide range of colors in addition to improved comfort at a lower price.</td>
