 There were four initial activities that the unit was assigned to conduct. They were Planning, Data Administration, Information Resource Management and Institutional Research. The organization of these activity areas within a single unit that reported directly to the President gave great convenience and impetus to efforts to better manage reliability and consistency in the data reported, disseminated and accessible both internal and external to the University. Information Resource Management with data administration a prominent element was linked directly to Planning and Institutional Research within the unit. The organization of the University Planning and Analysis unit resulted in development of both on-line and remote electronic access to data tables and statistics on various university programs.</td>
