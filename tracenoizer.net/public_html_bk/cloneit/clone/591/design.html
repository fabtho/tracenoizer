 A complete presentation on the Rapid Machine Design can be found here. . Eberhard Bamberg - Design Star Technology Grinder (STG) My Ph. thesis at MIT, titled Principles of Rapid Machine Design, presents a set of principles used in the design and manufacturing of the Star Technology Grinder (STG), a CNC-controlled five-axis grinding machine used to manufacture endmills and similar workpieces. Using the principles developed in this research project, the prototype of the STG was assembled in less than half the time required for the assembly of the existing machine, which is going to be replaced by the STG.</td>

 This allows one to obtain the corresponding blade widths and to then use these angles and blade widths for an aerodynamic analysis. . Clay NACA TN 201 Sep 1924 A description is given of the methods used in design of Micarta propellers. The most direct method for working out the design of a Micarta propeller is to start with the diameter and blade angles of a wooden propeller suited for a particular installation and then to apply one of the plan forms suitable for Micarta propellers. This allows one to obtain the corresponding blade widths and to then use these angles and blade widths for an aerodynamic analysis.</td>
