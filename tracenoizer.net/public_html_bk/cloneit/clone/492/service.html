 This location at Inlink will disappear soon, so please update your bookmarks with the Mindspring address. Thank you for visiting my page and I hope that you can find it in the future. However, for this price, we expect excellent food and service. The list is not restricted to fine dining and we do appreciate a good bargain. This list has plenty of places to go for a good cheap meal, but we are not going to list fast food restaurants.</td>

 They have their likes and their dislikes and it is difficult to completely set these aside. We have, however, given each restaurant a numerical ranking out of 20. Above 15 means that it should be taken very seriously, 13 or 14 means good food and 11 or 12 indicates that there is some good food served but other factors such as service or atmosphere might be lacking. And you can enjoy the site in the knowledge that all reviews are carried out anonymously and all meals and accommodation are paid for in full. If you know of a place that should be included in this site, let us know and we will schedule a review.</td>
