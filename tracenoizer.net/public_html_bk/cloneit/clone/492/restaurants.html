 However, for this price, we expect excellent food and service. The list is not restricted to fine dining and we do appreciate a good bargain. This list has plenty of places to go for a good cheap meal, but we are not going to list fast food restaurants. The line is drawn somewhere between Denny's and Applebee's. More information will be added for each restaurant, and more restaurants will be added to the list.</td>

 A look at how communities can gain control over fast-food franchise design and see that it fits the character of the community. Including a tour of cities and towns that have done so. Ever since Ray Kroc franchised the first McDonald's in 1954, fast-food restaurants have succeeded in deploying their standardized images from coast to coast. Many people obviously like fast food, if they didn't, fast-food restaurants wouldn't be such an enormous economic success. But many people also question the loss of community character and cultural distinctiveness that accompanies the cookie cutter architecture that seems to follow us everywhere.</td>
