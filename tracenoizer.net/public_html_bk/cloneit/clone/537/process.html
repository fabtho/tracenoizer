 --Nonblinded peer review apparently suffers from type I error to a greater extent than blinded peer review. That is, journals using nonblinded peer review publish a larger fraction of papers that should not have been published than do journals using blinded peer review. When reviewers know the identity of the author(s) of an article, they are able to (and evidently do) substitute particularistic criteria for universalistic criteria in their evaluative process. A single-blind review occurs when the reviewer(s) knows the identity of the author(s), but the latter do not know the identities of the former. With a double-blind review, neither reviewers' nor authors' identities are revealed to the other party.</td>
