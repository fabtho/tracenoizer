<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" We are interested in both high penetrance genes and the more common low penetrance, or modifier, genes. As an extension of this work we are now using microarray-based transcriptional profiling and array-based comparative genomic hybridization to characterize genetic changes that occur as normal breast epithelium undergoes malignant transformation through a series of premalignant lesions. Out current efforts at defining the function of the BRCA1 protein are focused on the development of genetic models. We are developing a human cell line model as well as a mouse model and have preliminary data to suggest a yeast model may also be useful. We will also use a microarray-based system to examine differences in gene regulation in model cells with and without functional BRCA1 protein.">

 Gary Redding who has served as interim commissioner will be moving to the Department of Medical Assistance as their new Commissioner. Martin has been a friend of the GAHSC for the past 10 years. He chaired, for a number of years, the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Human Development. He shepherded many budgets through the appropriations process. He has helped our providers to secure the resources that they needed to provide care to at risk children.</td>
