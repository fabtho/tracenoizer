 Internalized Oppression is the set of feelings and misinformation that individuals carry about themselves and other members of their own group. It is the turning inward of, and adopting as true, the misinformation that is directed toward oppressed people by the external oppression, and it is any way in which we treat other members of our group as if these things were true of them. Use it to figure out what pieces of internalized bisexual oppression you carry, so that you can begin to eliminate it (see back panel). It may be difficult to read this pamphlet, because it is painful to look at the ways we have come to accept our oppression inside our own minds. Recognizing our internalized oppression is the first step toward eliminating it.</td>
