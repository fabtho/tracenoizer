 Graphic Design Portal Home On Design Forums Graphic Design Classifieds Add a Site Thu. Removing unnecessary tags, line breaks, and indentations can shave several seconds off your page load times. We hope to make this site the ultimate reference for anyone looking for design information, tutorials, free help, or reputable graphic designers. Quite frankly, we're horrified at the number of totally unqualified people who manage to convince others to pay good money for bad design. We invite reputable designers (web, print, or combined format) to submit their sites for inclusion in this directory, with the understanding that they will be thoroughly reviewed before they are accepted.</td>
