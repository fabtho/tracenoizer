 Zogg passed these test with such high honors it caught the attention of a general who had in fact been looking for a strong young Orc with the will of a thousand generations of his cursed ancestors to be his partner in war if you will a side kick and an ally this Orc was Zogg summoned to Clanthia by that general his name Og the destroyer since his summoning he has learned much and he hopes to be as strong as his mentor Og. . Zogg can be found beside his clan member and closest friend in war OG the destroyer. Zogg wears a Rossanoe tabard and if you don't like it come see him and OG about it. He doesn't have much of a back ground seeing as he is only ten years old but in Orc years that makes him about 22-23 human years seeing as Orcs die of old age at 30 Orc years.</td>
