Davis arrived at Callaway Gardens on Monday and hit the practice range. He then met with Realtree Licensing Manager John Skrabo and picked up a fresh set of Advantage Timber clothing. Davis then headed off to LaGrange, GA with his hunting partner Dee Blackshear for an afternoon hunt with Team Realtree's David Blanton.</td>
