 Lionel Mandrake, President Merkin Muffley (not so obviously him), and of course the intelligent yet incredible odd scientist Dr. Essentially this movie answers the question to the what if scenario of the US bombing Russia. It is the quintessential cold war comedy with the often caricatured shot of a Slim Pickens (Taggart from Blazing Saddles) as Major T. Also worth noting is the young James Earl Jones (Yes good old Darth Vador's voice). He has a small part as Lieutenant Lothar Zogg, but you can definitely catch some deep vocal overtones from that voice that soon helped to make him a permanent fixture in movie history.</td>

 It was not only the legendary, well known Bobby Jones who put Augusta on the map. It was probably more the intensely private and very unusual Cliff Roberts who conceived the Club and fanatically nurtured it. Every controversy and major event surrounding the Club and this uniquely American event is surfaced, and treated comprehensively and fairly. In this day and electronic age, it is a pleasure to read someone who has such a command of the English language that he can make it stand up and bark. Anyone who appreciates great writing and is even remotely interested in golf or America, for that matter, should buy this book.</td>

Love is no longer hounded by questions about his lack of a major title -- a rainbow-inspired victory at the 1997 PGA Championship took care of that. But he's become a mini-version of Norman at Augusta, finishing second twice and the Top 10 on two other occasions without winning. "I'm very happy for Jose," said Love, who closed with a 1-under-par 71 in the brutally difficult conditions.</td>
