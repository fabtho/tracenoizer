 About 40 percent of the animals that come through here are from these kinds of situations. We keep the animals - as long as they're healthy and non-aggressive - until they get a home. Four dog kennels were added to the building last summer, doubling its canine capacity. Currently, the building is over capacity; housing 32 cats and 10 dogs. Other donated or stray pets- such as ferrets, birds and lizards - are donated to Pet Expo, a local pet supply store, or given to volunteers.</td>
