 The presence or absence of an Rh factor on the red blood cells is what makes your blood type positive or negative. Blood groups (A, B and O) and Rh types are descriptions of certain antigens found on red cells. People with type A blood have A antigens on their red blood cells and lack B antigens; people with type B blood have B antigens and lack A antigens; people with type AB blood have both antigens, and people with type O blood lack both A and B antigens. In addition, blood is typed as either Rh-positive or Rh-negative, referring to the presence or absence of the Rh antigen, which is named for the fact that it was first discovered in the Rhesus monkey. Most people (about 85 percent) are Rh-positive, and that figure is even higher for African-Americans and Asians.</td>

 Instead, every programming language allows for a single character data type. When distinctions between whitespace and non-printing, or between upper and lower case are important, the data itself is examined. This typing of variables and the attendant lack of facility for dealing with heterogeneous data is exactly what C does for everything BUT character variables. Now imagine how much easier programming would be if all variables could hold any object as easily as char variables hold any character, and that variables representing non-atomic data could contain elements of any type of data, in the same way that strings can contain any character. In Lisp, the data itself is (conceptually) typed by a tag.</td>

 After you have read all of the messages, you will see the shell prompt. " Shell commands are always followed by the return key unless otherwise indicated. Note also, that spaces (and lack of them) are important, and must be typed exactly as shown. In response to the command you typed above, you will be presented with the list of topics and given a prompt help topic. You will be presented with the list subtopics for print and prompted for subtopic.</td>
