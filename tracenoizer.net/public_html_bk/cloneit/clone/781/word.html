<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" Each element is separately labeled and then connected in a sentence structure, making speech essentially analytical. We use words so naturally that this thought may not at first seem significant, but it is crucial. Merely using a word often commits one to a vast interrelationship of assumptions and values--which is either a roadmap or a quagmire, depending on the verbal ability of the speaker. What we name are not things, but the analytical concepts by which we relate to the world. Visual thinkers may use a word as if the word had no opposite, stood in contrast to nothing else, and had no shadings of meaning that differentiated it from similar words.">

 Maybe Christ did not intend the gift of salvation for me or perhaps I'm just not worthy enough. Of course Satan was actively reinforcing my feelings through lack of understanding and rejection from others. I did not know the Word well enough to fight Satans' lies. I could continue to discuss all the feelings of depression and lament on how unfair life is. I would rather explain how God has enabled me to live with this disorder and answer His call to ministries in spite of and because of the bipolar.</td>

 "I think it's got some interesting features to it," said Brendan Barnicle, an analyst with Pacific Crest Securities. "I'm not sure that any of those are going to be things that force people to run out and upgrade. While those additions improve on earlier versions of Office - which includes the Word, Excel, Outlook, and PowerPoint applications - few corporate and home users are expected to buy into the latest version for its new technology. Although some analysts said the new features aren't worth the price, what is likely to boost interest in Office XP is Microsoft's new way of selling licenses to customers already running versions of the software package. 1, Microsoft said it will do away with the sale of version upgrades, pushing instead a variety of non-perpetual licensing agreements - or limited-use contracts - which the company said are intended to keep users running the latest versions of its software.</td>
