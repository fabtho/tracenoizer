 Blood groups (A, B and O) and Rh types are descriptions of certain antigens found on red cells. People with type A blood have A antigens on their red blood cells and lack B antigens; people with type B blood have B antigens and lack A antigens; people with type AB blood have both antigens, and people with type O blood lack both A and B antigens. In addition, blood is typed as either Rh-positive or Rh-negative, referring to the presence or absence of the Rh antigen, which is named for the fact that it was first discovered in the Rhesus monkey. Most people (about 85 percent) are Rh-positive, and that figure is even higher for African-Americans and Asians. This is why O negative is used in emergencies when there is no time to determine the blood type of the patient.</td>

 The Eagle Project serves not only to give something to the community, but it gives the Scout a sense of accomplishment, confidence in his abilities, and a recognition that one has a duty to help others. It truly is a unique experience for boys that cannot be found elsewhere. It is made all the more special by the fact that while it teaches those skills, Scouting also teaches them how to be good members of their communities. This review has been written as part of the Volunteerism write-off, organized by argonut. The purpose of this write-off is to give thanks and appreciation for the organizations dedicated to helping each one of us help other people.</td>

 An interprocedural monovariant first-order forward flow analysis associates sound and precise gap and field information for each document variable to each program point. Based on this information we can then determine if a program is type correct. If it is, the properties listed above will in fact hold. Runtime representation By exploiting the fact that only well-formed documents are constructed at runtime due to the static analysis, an efficient implementation can be obtained. It is the notion of tuple input fields which allows relations of dynamically varying sizes to be received on the server-side.</td>
