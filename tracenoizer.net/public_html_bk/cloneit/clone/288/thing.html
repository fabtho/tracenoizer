 But how do you detect the beam and reject other sources. It just seems to me (and I wish I had time to prove it) that its not necessary. 3D scanning takes almost no memory if you don't do the "frame difference" thing. One counter for "how far am I from the hsync pulse" and then that value gets RS232'd or what ever back to the host and then wait for vsync and then count down to the next horizontal line and repeat. Over the course of 256 fields, you get a complete vertical scan.</td>
