 Two laser transmitters set to converge at a spot at the far end of your expected range. Use a CCD to accurately measure the distance between the dots. no need for two lasers and two dots if the camera is mounted a fixed distance from the laser. you can turn the laser off, take a frame, and if the dot is still there, it wasn't the laser. What's left are only the laser dots and some noise, which could be easily filtered.</td>
