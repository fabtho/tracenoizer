 Petersburg Times, published September 17, 2000 Next time George W. Bush wants to change his campaign slogan, he might want to buy the domain name as well. Following a rough couple of weeks on the trail, the Bush camp announced a new aphorism Thursday, "Real Plans for Real People. " But no one bothered to register the phrase on the Internet. Virginia resident Patrick West, who describes himself as a "Ken Starr Democrat," heard about the slogan change and quickly attempted to register the phrase as a domain name.</td>

 No doubt, using the Graffiti handwriting program on a Palm can be a drag; even after you master it, you can't enter text as quickly as most people write with pen and paper. Graffiti doesn't accept doodles or drawings; the SmartPad can. Allowing users to beam pen and paper jottings to the Palm in real time seems like a natural step. For those who need a drawing capability, the SmartPad could be useful, and it's the first device to help move graphics or handwritten notes from the Palm into your PC. Alas, well-intended as it is, the SmartPad is saddled with too many conceptual and practical problems.</td>

 . ABACUS by Elizabeth Knight For the past couple of months Telstra, Optus and Vodafone have been circling like vultures.
