 I recently played for a band called Anthesis which broke up on a pretty pathetic note, and a week later George recruited me because Margin Of Victory needed a new guitarist. Outside of playing guitar I like ta go to shows, snowboard, bike, play wallball or anything else that gives me a rush. , and anyone else who's influenced me over the past few years. Lotsa thanks to anyone thats been checking up on us and supporting us even though we're nothing as of yet. .</td>

 Greg Hopp will also be driving Fred Leland's U-100 and will drive the Light when the boats don't have conflicting schedules. This will be a giant step up for the Hopp's who last year campaigned a 27 year old hull and captured the Region 10 High Points Championship and finished in 3rd place in the Unlimited Light High Points race. Jerry Hopp, 54, will be entering his 34th year of hydroplane racing and is a past National Champion and has won many Regional Championships. He is a qualified Unlimited driver also, having owned and driven many Unlimiteds in the past. Greg Hopp has been racing since he was 9 years old and replaced Chip Hanauer when he retired and has been driving the U-100 ever since.</td>

 .html This model boat club was formed to promote all kinds of model boating, but has very strong tendenacys toward racing, both inboard and out- board . In our membership we have, past and present national champions in just about all classes. With the Tucson Model Boat Club, together we started, a few years back, the Arizona Championship Points Series. This has been very sucessful bringing new boaters into the hobby.</td>
