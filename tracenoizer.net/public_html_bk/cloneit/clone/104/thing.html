 we'll have to get together sometime--ya know-to wrestle trees and stuff. but thats aiight yo-check this out (it's still alive. ) When the pawn hits the conflicts he thinks like a king, what he knows throws the blows as he goes to the fight, and he'll win the whole thing 'fore he enters the ring, there's no body to batter when your mind is your might. i have trouble lettin go of stuff so im just gonna add to this one-we saw green day this past wednesday in ol' new york city. next time-not on a school night--kelley dirnt, signing off.</td>

 this is serious stuff treat it as if the boat was 300 feet out if its only 30 feet out. and plus they sell little inflatable rafts in the stores buy one. I can cast this thing out about 60 yard's, also I painted it day glow orange. You can't throw them very far, but they hold lots of beer, gear, and you can run circles around yourself. He already out there swimming for it before i can get a chance to put my radio down.</td>

 I do not by any standard intend on relinquishing the United States Title to either Shawn or Wicka. I mean who really would want Shawn as the US champ. One thing that the both of us agree upon is the fact that Chris Jericho is a worthless Canadian and you might as well BLAME CANADA, BLAME CANADA. Back to HBK though, I am getting too far off of the main subject here. Actually, I could if I fought you 36 times in a row, then I would be 40-0 in ladder matches.</td>
