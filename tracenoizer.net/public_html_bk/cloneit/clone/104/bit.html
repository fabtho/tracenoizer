 Tony Kubek's pickbd2 PC-Keyboard emulator using a PIC16F84. Before you begin, you will need to collect the necessary hardware and software items to have something to work with. I will start with a basic list and provide further explanation on each of the listed items a bit later. PIC Microcontroller Instruction Set Quick Reference and Core Comparison Matrix. .</td>

 (No need to bake a special instruction for it into a cheap processor. 203125 and so on until you acheive the desired accuracy over the range required. Another usefull technique ( if the data is from an 8 bit adc, as it possibly is since this is a pic forum). is to oversample the data, X number of times that will later simplify engineering units conversion or whatever. Just email your FAX number and I will send it to you.</td>
