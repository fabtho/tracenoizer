 The kind of books a boy reads is of vastly more importance that the kind of food he eats or the style of his clothes. There are more good books than any one can think of reading in a life time. Among the first to recognize the need for proper selection of reading for boys, the Boy Scouts of America has consistently conducted a campaign of education along the line of proper reading for the growing boy and the young man. Since my coming to this city I am very happy to say that the Public Library have materially assisted me in this matter, making use of the approved list of books for boys edited by the Library Commission of the Boy Scouts of America. It is the duty of parents to see to it that the boys use the Library and that the Librarian be consulted on questions pertaining to the boys reading.</td>

 What a mixed bag in this day of Sensitive New Age Guys. Expressed in the most simplistic terms, they hear that it's OK to cry over the loss of a pet; but don't cry, be a big boy on the first day of school. We want our boys to be good friends to their male companions, but flinch at expressions of love --- a hug, a shared tear. We --- parents, teachers, friends, society --- can rethink this code. We can learn to read boys, we can respond differently.</td>
