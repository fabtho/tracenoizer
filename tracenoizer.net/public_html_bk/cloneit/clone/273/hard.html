 She said she used to go out in the morning with the men's crews and spend the entire workday doing the exact same things the men did. Penn State boxing coach Bill Wrable, always extremely protective of his boxers, at first was leery of letting the inexperienced Wilcox in the ring. But after months of hard work, Wilcox got her shot. Lock Haven's Karen Thrapp to capture the first female national championship in collegiate boxing history.

 I have subsequently discovered that Larry borrowed the arrangement and recorded it first. The two CDs also share wonderful cover designs by Tom Bower, the creator of those striking scraperboard illustrations in the grey edition of Northern Harmony. I particularly like the voices of Andy Turner and Ian Giles who are to be heard to good effect as soloists in 'An Anthem from Psalm the 18th' aka 'The earthquake anthem' and I also love hard-edged alto voices, or as Dave (and Knapp) prefers to call them, 'counters'. All three altos in the choir acquit themselves well in the solos, but really come into their own in 'An Anthem for Christmas', which is performed by the ladies only, and works very well. At a time when choirs were all male and the trebles and counters were boys, however, I doubt whether Knapp would have approved.</td>
