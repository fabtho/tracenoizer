<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" The youngest, Andrew, married Alice Fanny Charlo(s) who was four years his senior. In this position, she would have been earning about twenty pounds per year. One wonders why she travelled from Dorset to here for there is no trace of her parents living on the Isle. If her father was a soldier, then perhaps he may have been transferred there temporarily to the guard at Parkhurst Prison with Fanny gaining employment through this connection and staying after her parents moved yet again. Another possibility is that she was related to the Charlo family living at Ryde for many years.">

 Among the first to recognize the need for proper selection of reading for boys, the Boy Scouts of America has consistently conducted a campaign of education along the line of proper reading for the growing boy and the young man. Since my coming to this city I am very happy to say that the Public Library have materially assisted me in this matter, making use of the approved list of books for boys edited by the Library Commission of the Boy Scouts of America. It is the duty of parents to see to it that the boys use the Library and that the Librarian be consulted on questions pertaining to the boys reading. Why should parents of boys commit the unpardonable offense of wasting their boys time by placing in his hands books of a negative value. The library is full of good books for free circulation and both boys and parents should make use of it.</td>

 Expressed in the most simplistic terms, they hear that it's OK to cry over the loss of a pet; but don't cry, be a big boy on the first day of school. We want our boys to be good friends to their male companions, but flinch at expressions of love --- a hug, a shared tear. We --- parents, teachers, friends, society --- can rethink this code. We can learn to read boys, we can respond differently. " Parents, with their celebrated instinct, need to respect their own inner twinges in order to help their sons break free of the stifling myths of masculinity.</td>
