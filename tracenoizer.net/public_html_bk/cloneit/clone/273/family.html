 They beat Knapp and another man with trash cans, pipes and bicycles. The attack put both men in the hospital, but Knapp suffered severe injuries and spent several weeks in a coma. All six attackers got the maximum jail time, but the victim's family says the sentence is light compared to the sentence Troy Knapp will serve for life. He's confined to a bed, suffers regular seizures and must wear a diaper. Knapp was wheeled into the courtroom today to tell the judge about the lynching.</td>

 A California pioneer, Lydia Knapp arrived in San Diego in 1869 and was the first American woman to live on Point Loma. She saw Old Town in its heyday, and became active in the community life of Horton's New Town, She experienced the booms and depressions of San Diego's early years and lived to play a vital part in its development during the first quarter of this century. One of Lydia's earliest recollections was clinging to her father as the family bid him goodbye when he left Newburyport on the brig Ark for California in 1849. Daniel Smith was among the first of the easterners to join the tide of argonauts seeking their fortune in California. His father had sailed for California in 1826 and was lost in the Pacific, but in spite of this tragedy the lure of California remained in the hearts of the family.</td>
