Social issues aside, geodesic construction remains one of the most eficient means of creating space. Fuller himself explained the beauty of the geodesic structure when he wrote "The largest volume, least event, omnitriangular system is the icosahedron and its multiple subtriangulated 'geodesic' patterning. "(1) For Buckminster Fuller, geodesic fabrication was a means of easily creating pure forms and pure expression of form.</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="6"><td valign="bottom"> Get your site now Affiliate Network Put 100 Magazines to Work for YOU. Buckminster Fuller Spaceship Earth Visionary and designer, poet and engineer, R. When Buckminster Fuller conceived the geodesic dome, he dreamed that it would house humanity. Constructed of a complex framework of self-bracing triangles, the geodesic dome is the strongest and most economical structure ever designed. No other form of enclosure covers so much area without internal supports.</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="2"<td valign="center"> There was no distinction between arts and crafts, and the art was to be designed for the working class.

Thus, any dome that is a portion of a sphere has the least surface through which to lose heat or intercept potentially damaging winds. A geodesic dome uses a pattern of self-bracing triangles in a pattern that gives maximum structural advantage, thus theoretically using the least material possible. ) Click the pictures above to examine patent drawings. Local loads are distributed throughout the geodesic dome, utilizing the entire structure.</td><tr></table><br>A site I really like: <a href="http://www.NetStoreUSA.com/libros/welcome.shtml">http://www.NetStoreUSA.com/libros/welcome.shtml</a><br><br></font><font size=-6> <a class="nav" href="http://www.nektar.ch/klon/288/index.html">.</a><br><br></font></body></html>
