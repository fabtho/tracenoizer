This allows flexibility of size, with the same inherent qualities of self-supporting tensions and strengths, and without the need for central columns or supports.

 . Social issues aside, geodesic construction remains one of the most eficient means of creating space. Fuller himself explained the beauty of the geodesic structure when he wrote "The largest volume, least event, omnitriangular system is the icosahedron and its multiple subtriangulated 'geodesic' patterning. "(1) For Buckminster Fuller, geodesic fabrication was a means of easily creating pure forms and pure expression of form. By ignoring the diversity of options that geodetic construction allows, Fuller was limited in his work to sphereical buildings.</td>

 Twice expelled from Harvard University, business disasters and the death of his four year old daughter brought him close to suicide. However he decided to devote himself to proving that technology could save the World from itself, providing it is properly used. He examined a vectorial system of geometry, Energetic-Synergetic geometry, based on the tetrahedron which provides maximum strength with minimum structure. This led to his patent of a geodesic dome in 1947, a building the strength of which need only increase as the log of its size. Fuller was research professor at Carbondale, Southern Illinois University, from 1959 to 1968.</td>

 His ideas found their expression in forms such as the egg, ball, sphere and geodesic dome. The triangle is a natural mathematical figure that, in combination with other triangles, provides maximum efficiency with minimum structural effort. By assembling a series of identical geometrical units that are both self-supporting and light, Fuller obtained a dynamic construction in which the individual components contribute to the overall structure. While each component is independent, it cannot exist without the others. The experience was nevertheless considered conclusive enough for Buckminster Fuller to move on to the construction of larger domes.</td>
