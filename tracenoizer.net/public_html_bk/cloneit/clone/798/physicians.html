 Hospitals that perform certain procedures are typically more often experienced and may have better outcomes. Ask the hospital to provide you with information on the percentage of active staff certified by a member organization of the American Board of Medical Specialties. For instance, to evaluate the emergency room capabilities of a hospital, you may want to ask for the percentage of board-certified physicians in emergency medicine and the number of emergency room visits that occurred in the past year. If you have children, ask about their capabilities to treat pediatric emergencies. Ask the hospital for information on how it monitors quality-of-care.</td>
