Contemporary Classical Music Composers The Contemporary Classical Music Archives Composers Page 20 August 1999 UPDATE This section of Eyeneer Music Archives has been under reconstruction for several months (far longer than we had originally hoped) and we really appreciate your patience with us. Our attempt to vastly improve The Contemporary Classical Music Archives has proven to be a much greater task than originally expected and unfortunately until all items go through legal clearance we won't be active again until at least the first week of September, 1999. The good news is that at long last, our readers will be able to purchase recordings directly off The Contemporary Classical Music Archives.</td>
