 " Grab the cat and throw it into the electrified rabbit ears. Not only will your band of adventurers think the effect was truly magical, but that damn cat will never spray your golf shoes again. THE HORROR SURVIAL GAME Games like Resident Evil and Silent Hill have introduced a new genre, the Survival Horror game, which basically lets gamers act out the part of the hero in one of those old horror movies we all love so much. The beauty part of my game, called "The Reeking Horror", is that not only do your gamers get to enjoy the adrenaline rush of their favorite horror game, but you and the little lady will get a weekend without the kids. To make the experience perfect, you'll need to start the game on a rainy, stormy night, preferably with lots of thunder and lightning.</td>
