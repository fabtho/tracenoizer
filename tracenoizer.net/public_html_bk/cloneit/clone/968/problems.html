<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" The Children's Habilitation Clinic, founded as the Center for Handicapped Children in 1956, is a multidisciplinary clinic which provides care for children with developmental disabilities and education for health professionals in the care of children with disabilities. Children from birth through twenty-one years of age with known or suspected impairments involving movement, self-care, communication, and learning are appropriate for care. This includes children with acquired disabilities and degenerative problems, as well as children with congenital problems. Special clinics are held for children with spina bifida, and the genetics program at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) sees children with metabolic disorders and other genetic problems. Most of our patients have multiple impairments, most commonly cerebral palsy, but a specific diagnosis does not make a child eligible or ineligible for care at CHC.">

 . Neary The Pediatric Cardiology Handbook by Myung K. While the severity of heart problems in children is not minimized, the authors emphasize that most conditions are now treatable. This book describes the latest developments in understanding and treating heart problems in children. My only regret is that of another review in that the statistical information is out of date.</td>

 In the past three years, we have used this book many times to answer questions, learn what to look for, and to train ourselves in how to handle certain medical conditions. com) from California, USA I bought this book before I gave birth to my daughter with down syndrome and it has been the most used book so far. It gives you so much info on heart problems, feeding problems, hints, things to check out. Kids with down syndrome need extra care and you need to be informed because not all dr's are. Well Written and some really cute pictures of kids.</td>

 . AACAP Facts For Families FACTS FOR FAMILIES Not all children grow from infancy through their adolescent years without experiencing some bumps along the way. While every child is unique and special, sometimes they encounter emotions, feelings or behavior that cause problems in their lives and the lives of those around them. The AACAP developed Facts for Families to provide concise and up-to-date information on issues that affect children, teenagers, and their families. The AACAP provides this important information as a public service and the Facts for Families may be duplicated and distributed free of charge as long as the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry is properly credited and no profit is gained from their use.</td>
