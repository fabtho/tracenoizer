 . Simon, a quirky Austrian artist, seeks solace at a 300-year-old grave in old Tokyo, entertaining a fantasy of the courtesan who is buried there. Helen, an assertive American radio announcer who has studied Japanese, vainly tries to understand her environment by intellectualising everything. Does internationalisation somehow make us exiles wherever we may be. He has been holding art exhibitions, doing performance projects and film work in Japan, Europe and the US.</td>

 A strange Austrian artist feels attracted to an unusual Japanese young lady he met in New York's Chelsea Hotel and who found a mysterious monument in Tokyo. The privileged young Japanese girl finds her freedom in the role of Lift Girl, which reduces her many choices to a simple 'up' or 'down'. A British radio reporter who lives in New York falls in love with a sacked Japanese salaryman. Characters and cultures clash, opposite poles meet. The characters are not 'built up', there are no conclusions.</td>
