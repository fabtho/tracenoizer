 This huge pile of different posters all designed with a similar goal gave me the idea for another lecture or discussion in the course, comparing the different approaches for attracting people to an art show. I picked up about twenty-five different posters on Wednesday (25 May) to use in Friday's class. I usually do not cover much poster design in the course (other than a slide lecture or two on poetry broadsides from the library's Special Collections, which I had already done that quarter), but a discussion on poster design was well within the range of things that are suitable for the class. Because these posters were a spur-of-the-moment addition to the course, I did not have time to do a careful analysis of them, nor to construct a coherent framework for discussing them. This approach had been fairly successful spring quarter, with most of the students who attended class participating in the discussion.</td>
