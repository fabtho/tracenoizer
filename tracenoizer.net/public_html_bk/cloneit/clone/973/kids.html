 I have recently become an Independent Consultant for Usborne Books and I love it. I have been a teacher for the last 17 years and am currently on a leave to spend time with my children. I can make my own hours, work when I want, and provide others (and my own kids) with a quality product that lasts a lifetime. ..</td>

 If you represent a fathers group and do not have your own homepage, we have designers available to assist you. We provide ACTION ALERTS which will be updated regularly so that you, too, can participate in the democratic process and make a difference. Kids are what being a father is all about, so make sure you check out The Kids' Corner, made for, designed and maintained by our kids. ..</td>
