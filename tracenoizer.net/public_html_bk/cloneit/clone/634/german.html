 Here, you will find some minimal information about the library and access to its catalog. ch The Library Catalog The Web Opac Catalog is a union catalog of almost 2 million titles in libraries of the Swiss universities at Basel and Bern. It forms part of IDS, a consortium of all university libraries in German speaking Switzerland. It uses the Aleph 500 library system developped by ExLibris Ltd. .</td>

 changed pagers (prev, next, etc) to support language. added txt_quota_account as it showed the text for editing when in the settings screen. corrected French and German text in txt_error_no_username. If set, it will be impossible to see, edit, create and delete accounts with the definied names. There are system accounts (hidden) and read only accounts (visible, but read only).</td>
