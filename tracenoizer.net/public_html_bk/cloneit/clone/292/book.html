 . Buckminster Fuller, the visionary who exhorted us to "think global, act local" and devised the geodesic dome and the concept of Spaceship Earth. It seems like the book could have been printed in a less costly form and many of the graphics which were clearly just taken from video eliminated so that the material could be made available to more people at a lower price. That said, I thoroughly enjoyed the glorious visual aspect of this book. In my years spent researching my book "Buckminster Fuller's Universe" and working on other Fuller writing, I had not seen some of the photographs and illustrations displayed here.</td>

 Fuller was the epitome of the poet as engineer, the thinker as designer, the artist as researcher. He left behind a voluminous quantity of writing, including texts of visionary importance and penetrating linguistic force, as well as of urgent topicality. The book documents various aspects of Fuller's widely respected texts. These testaments were intended to be shared with the whole world, or, as Fuller coined it in 1950, with Spaceship Earth.
