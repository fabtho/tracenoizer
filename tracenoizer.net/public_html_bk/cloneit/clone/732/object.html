Ironically, this wide variety of choice is one impediment to the significant benefits promised by software reuse. The emergence of the Unified Modeling Language (UML)-created by the joint efforts of leading object technologists Grady Booch, Ivar Jacobson, and James Rumbaugh with contributions from many others in the object community-represents one of the most significant developments in object technology. Included is a brief explanation of UML's history, development, and rationale, as well as discussions on how UML can be integrated into the object-oriented development process. In addition, the authors offer the first look at the emerging Objectory Software Development Process derived from the methodologies of Grady Booch, Ivar Jacobson, and James Rumbaugh."><meta name="Revisit-after" content="1 month"><meta name="Date_modified" content="2001-06-13"><meta name="ROBOTS" content="index,follow"></head><style type="text/css"> 	A.nav:link {TEXT-DECORATION: none}	A.nav:visited {TEXT-DECORATION: none} 	A.nav:visited {TEXT-DECORATION: none}	A.nav:active {TEXT-DECORATION: none}	A.nav:hover {TEXT-DECORATION: none}	</style><body bgcolor="#FFFFF">	<font face="arial" size="3" color="#000000">	<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">	<tr><td><a href="language.html" class="nav">language</a></td></tr>	<tr><td><a href="index.html" class="nav">home page</a></td></tr></table>	<br><div align="center"><font size="6">- object -<br><br></font></div><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3"<td valign="bottom"> , each book must be in subject 1 AND subject 2 AND . .

Some of them will only become easy through the use of Zope extension components, so called products. As was outlined in the introduction, a Zope web site consists of objects that belong to various object classes. Through the use of these containers, the web site gets a hierarchical structure. Each object is identified by an id inside its container.</td><tr></table><br>also look at: <a href="http://www.objectwatch.com/issue_33.htm">http://www.objectwatch.com/issue_33.htm</a><br><br></font><font size=-6> <a class="nav" href="http://www.mediamaterial.ch/~klon/513/index.html">.</a><br><br></font></body></html>
