 Collaborative engineering raises systems issues related to the sharing of large volumes of fine-grain, complex objects across wide-area networks and administrative boundaries. PerDiS automatically manages all these aspects in a well defined, integrated, and automatic way. Distributed application programming is simplified because it uses the same memory abstraction as in the centralized case. Porting an existing centralized program is usually a matter of a few, well-isolated changes. We present some performance results from a proof-of-concept platform that runs a number of small, but real, distributed applications on Unix and Windows NT.</td>

 We also discuss and examine a variety of the more important projects in the field over the last few years. . A variety of different design methodologies have arisen from these research efforts, and numerous visual programming systems have been developed to address both specific application areas, such as user interface design and physical simulation, and more general programming tasks. We present a survey of the field of visual programming languages beginning with an historical overview of some of the pioneering efforts in the field. In addition, we present different classifications of visual programming languages, touch on implementation and design issues, and discuss efforts to formalize the theoretical basis for visual languages.</td>
