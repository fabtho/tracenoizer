Knott's PhD Thesis I'm looking for an entirely readable version of Alistair Knott's PhD thesis (1996) (both versions that I found on Edimburg's site and on Knott's personal site in New-Zealand where only readable until page 35). Perhaps code-switching is not the appropriate term here, because the author learned German as a second language later in life, so I'd also like to know if there is a better literary term for this technique. In many instances, appropriate strategies require an understanding of causes of language shift and language endangerment, and therefore part of the project is also addressed to these causes.
