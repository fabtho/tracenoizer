<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" A Trojan House A house of trick cards, the woman as house. " - Edgar Daniels "Architectural structures become the structures of relationships, establishing the windows of communication (between parents and children, between lovers) while preserving a sense of enclosure, isolation. "There's a paradox at the center of Couzin's work, in that for all of the wariness of form and order her films express, they remain tightly organized, elegant formal studies. SALVE is her most paradoxical film and, I think, her richest. A young girl's discovery of 'the relationships between the quantities' - of geometry, volume, time, and numbers - is seen as an ineffably tragic development.">

 During the second year of the course students are scheduled to spend three months gaining practical experience with professional film and television production companies. Students must pass an intermediate examination before beginning the Advanced Studies segment and a further examination to begin their diploma year. During the course exercise films (16 mm) and videos will be produced. Usually individual and group films are created once a year. During the fourth year of their studies students produce a diploma film.</td>
