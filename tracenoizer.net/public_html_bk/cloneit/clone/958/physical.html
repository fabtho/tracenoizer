 Women's Sexual Health This is an informational site designed for women and their partners who have questions and concerns about women's sexual health. We hope that physicians will also find this site a valuable resource. This site has information for the millions of women who have had a healthy and satisfying sexual relationship in the past but who are currently experiencing some physical symptoms that are preventing them from enjoying this part of life. We have specific information on female sexual arousal disorder (FSAD), which is one type of sexual dysfunction. While there may be multiple reasons that a woman may have FSAD, we talk about some physical reasons and give women options to consider.</td>

 Another Nancy Drew aficionado, we exchanged books, talked about plots, became fast friends. While other girls were busy discovering boys, I was busy discovering the loving fulfillment of a relationship with another girl. She was the epitome of young womanhood and we had a strong physical attraction for one another. The ultimate mystery about Claire was her willingness to share physical closeness with me, but she would not kiss me. Claire became a nun, and I mourned her passing into convent life.</td>

 Women with Type II diabetes are more likely to have difficulties than their non-diabetic sisters. The doctor will ask you questions to obtain your medical history and to assess your symptoms. Your doctor knows that sex is a combination of the physical and the psychological. There are several different physical reasons for sexual difficulties. If your blood glucose levels are up and down, you will not feel well.</td>

 Few investigators asked women to describe their experiences from their own points of view. When such studies were done, it became apparent that women and men differ in many crucial ways. Women's accounts do not fit neatly into the Masters and Johnson model; for example, women generally do not separate "desire" from "arousal," women care less about physical than subjective arousal, and women's sexual complaints frequently focus on "difficulties" that are absent from the DSM. Women's social environments thus can prevent the expression of biological capacities, a reality entirely ignored by the strictly physiological framing of sexual dysfunctions. 2) The erasure of the relational context of sexuality.</td>
