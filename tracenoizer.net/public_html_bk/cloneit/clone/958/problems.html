 . Michael Smith June 28, 2000 -- Whether it's a matter of not being "in the mood" or having difficulties with vaginal dryness or orgasm, women's sexual difficulties can stem from a variety of causes. Now it appears that a culprit long associated with men's erectile problems, high blood pressure, also can diminish women's sexual pleasure. Although it has long been known that men with high blood pressure are more likely to have difficulty with erections, little medical research has been done in women. One trend in researching women's sexual problems is to determine which conditions known to cause erectile problems in men, such as diabetes and high blood pressure, also create problems for women.</td>

 Women's social environments thus can prevent the expression of biological capacities, a reality entirely ignored by the strictly physiological framing of sexual dysfunctions. The erasure of the relational context of sexuality. The American Psychiatric Association's DSM approach bypasses relational aspects of women's sexuality, which often lie at the root of sexual satisfactions and problems--e. The DSM takes an exclusively individual approach to sex, and assumes that if the sexual parts work, there is no problem; and if the parts don't work, there is a problem. But many women do not define their sexual difficulties this way.</td>

" But women's sexual problems differ from men's in basic ways which are not being examined or addressed. We believe that a fundamental barrier to understanding women's sexuality is the medical classification scheme in current use, developed by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) for its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Disorders (DSM) in 1980, and revised in 1987 and 1994. These "dysfunctions" are disturbances in an assumed universal physiological sexual response pattern ("normal function") originally described by Masters and Johnson in the 1960s(3).</td>
