 .edu The history of lesbians of color is hidden between the lines of heterosexual, male and white history. Although lesbians of color have always been present in all facets of daily life and social movements, it was not until the late 1970s, that lesbians of color began energetically organizing "out" groups, compiling anthologies and reclaiming our history. This site is dedicated to locating and making this herstory accessible. .</td>

 Announcing the 4th Edition of the all new Bisexual Resource Guide. The all-new, up-to-date Bisexual Resource Guide 4th Edition is here. The growth in the number of bi groups over the years is evidence of a burgeoning movement, but perhaps even more powerful a statement is the number of groups which formerly ignored (or even denied access to) bisexual people which now include us. " The Bisexual Resource Guide 4th Edition is now in stock. Compiled by an international team of volunteers, it lists every known bisexual group worldwide.</td>

 To show that we as Bisexual's are immportant to all LGBT and homosexual issues and causes. I belive that we as Bisexual's are never heard and spoken about. The groups main purpose is to help the bisexual community maintain a presence in the LGBT community. The PBC has a purpose of keeping the bisexual community informed of the LGBT community. The Community is ment for philadelphia, western Pa and the delaware valley area Bisexuals to meet, mingle, hang out and connect with each other I formed this group because the Bisexual community has been relativly unkown and has no presence in any LGBT events and LGBT community centers.</td>
