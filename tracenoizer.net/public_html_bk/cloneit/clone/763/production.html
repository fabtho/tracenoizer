 Sustainable process development includes the planning and design of production-, assembly- and material flow systems, of manufacturing processes and industrial structures as well as of recycling processes. . Sustainable process development Successful products need innovative processes of production. Sustainable process development leads to manufacturing processes that guarantee a superior cost-effectiveness of the products as well as it meets the requirements of resource protection.

 Senior management has since cultivated a market-driven philosophy. Specifications for a new machine were previously co-written by engineering and marketing personnel with little interaction until the prototype was built. After the prototype was reviewed, it was placed in the production cycle, and any remaining design issues and additional product development to meet market needs then would be addressed. This engineering-driven philosophy caused significant internal disruptions and inefficiencies in design and manufacturing due to unstable specifications. A competitive maturing market with more knowledgeable customers helped drive JLG to make changes in the process.</td>
