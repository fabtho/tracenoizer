 I am a computer consultant and this book allowed me to complete several websites using the design principles within. The design of the book assists in illustrating the principles described within, the author presents the information in a logical well thought out fashion. I would recommend (and have) this book to engineers and other technical individuals who are faced with the need to produce web sites and other design oriented projects. I like many others have the technical expertise to produce HTML, cgi, perl and java - I just needed someone to help bring my site ideas and design principals into focus. I guess it's like having a professional designer on call, except you can't beat her rates.</td>
