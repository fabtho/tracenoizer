 The book includes a CD-ROM that is filled with browser-safe palettes for use in Photoshop, and other imaging programs. The colors are organized by relationships and includes hundreds of suggested color swatches for web page design. 0, Ditherbox, Debabelizer Pro, and includes a few more color theory ideas. If you already own Coloring Web Graphics (1st Edition) the upgrade is not significant, and the CD content is identical. x x table of contents updates and mistakes how to order about the authors x x x other chapters .</td>

Successful design needs careful planning and research before ideas are explored. Approaching a problem without knowledge or preparation will make the problem more difficult to solve. You need to use basic design principles to achieve success in whatever you are trying to design.</td>

 If you're just getting started, this book might be fine. Glaeser provides a minimal (and occasionally cryptic) introduction to the subject in prose alongside most of the C source code you will need to implement the concepts. He explains the ideas just enough that you can understand the code. It does not correspond to the source in the text, it seems to be a much more advanced version of the system he developed on an SGI Iris running Unix. If you happen to have such a machine, perhaps you can get it to compile.</td>
