 . The disk contains working source code examples, original code for a commercial- quality bit-plane graphics library, and source code and executable files for a sprite-editor program. --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title. Ingram This book will make life a lot simpler for C programmers who develop high-speed graphics and special effects for the PC without the benefit of a graphics coprocessor. Dorfman introduces a disk library of sprite management routines that emulate segments of the graphics coprocessor, allowing programmers to more easily create graphic elements for full-motion games, animation and multimedia programs.</td>

 Glaeser provides a minimal (and occasionally cryptic) introduction to the subject in prose alongside most of the C source code you will need to implement the concepts. He explains the ideas just enough that you can understand the code. It does not correspond to the source in the text, it seems to be a much more advanced version of the system he developed on an SGI Iris running Unix. If you happen to have such a machine, perhaps you can get it to compile. I decided instead to type in sections by hand, coming to understand everything I put in, fixing some glaring errors even before compiling, and bringing up sections incrementally.</td>

 . The juggling is probably a reference by the poster designer to Chichester-Clark using sectarian division to maintain control of both Protestants and Catholics in Northern Ireland. The additional text may be a reference to the 'Price Sisters' who were on hunger strike in jail in England. The British government eventually took the decision to introduce 'direct rule' and Stormont was prorogued on 30 March 1972.
