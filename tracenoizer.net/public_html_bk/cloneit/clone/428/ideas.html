 I predict that it will become one of the classics of science along with Darwin's The Origin of the Species. " --- Samuel Eliot Morison "This book is his bible - the distilled wisdom of a lifetime spent contemplating the Universe from angles and directions never before suspected. Its wealth of closely packed ideas is inexhaustible. It will be a source of endless inspiration and stimulus to those engaged in the most urgent task of our time - the effort to save Spaceship Earth from disaster. Clarke, author of 2001 "He has put it all together - his eternal sense of wonder and his gift of being able to look around him as though everything was being seen for the first time.</td>

 Buckminster Fuller (1895-1983) was a visionary of the modern age. He was an early proponent of geodesic domes--semispherical structures made up of incredibly light and extremely strong triangular components--which he recommended for economical and energy-efficient housing and other purposes. An entire chapter in this engaging book is devoted to domes; other chapters cover Fuller's far-reaching ideas on the Dymaxion House, Dymaxion Transportation, Synergetics, and Megastructures. ) With more than 200 black-and-white photos and drawings, this is a wonderfully nontechnical introduction to and celebration of the man, his remarkable inventions, and their modern-day relevance. A celebration of the designer and inventor's ideas, by a fellow inventor who worked with Fuller for three decades, describing his life-affirming vision of science and technology.</td>

 . But he was also an outsider, a technical expert with a poet's imagination who by the 1930s had already developed theories on environmental issues and anticipated the rapid globalization of our planet. This visual reader documents and examines Fuller's theories, ideas, designs, and projects. It also takes an analytical look at his ideology of technology as panacea. It contains numerous illustrations, many published here for the first time, as well as texts by Fuller and the editors.</td>
