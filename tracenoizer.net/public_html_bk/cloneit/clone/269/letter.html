<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" He was also devoted and fervent in religious matters, and after he became a Catholic, lived a life that was exemplary. Christopher Wright was married to Margaret Ward, sister of Marmaduke Ward of Mulwith who married his sister Ursula Wright. He was thus brother-in-law to Thomas Ward, the servant in Lord Monteagle's household who told the plotters about the letter. By her he had at least one son, John, who married into the Busfield family of Lincolnshire. Spink uses this strong family connection between Christopher Wright, the Wards, and Monteagle as the basis for his argument that Christopher Wright was the Gunpowder Plot conspirator who betrayed his friends and coerced the Jesuit Oldcorne into writing the famous letter.">
