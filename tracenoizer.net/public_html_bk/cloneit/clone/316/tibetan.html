 . Medicine Rooted in Old Tibet (NY TIMES) World Tibet Network News Tuesday, November 11, 1997 2. Medicine Rooted in Old Tibet (NY TIMES) By STEPHEN HOLDEN If this gentle, optimistic film about the wonders of Tibetan medicine, becomes popular, it could drive hordes of the terminally ill to seek the painstakingly concocted herbal remedies for which the physicians and researchers interviewed in the movie make dramatic claims. How valid those assertions are, of course, is anybody's guess. But if what the "The Knowledge of Healing" says about the effectiveness of these cures is true, the Tibetan system, which dates from the 12th century, deserves serious consideration as a supplement to Western medical technology.</td>
