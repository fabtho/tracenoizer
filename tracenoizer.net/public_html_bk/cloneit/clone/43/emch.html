 The Dallas-based company, which went public in August 1996, already has grown at a rapid clip in a burgeoning industry. Its twin strategies to offer a full range of services and make the most of technology have fueled that effort. HealthCor's "superior information system" should allow it to drive down its nursing operating costs while improving the quality of care, as well as the accuracy and accessibility of documentation, according to Emch. That boost in productivity, combined with more accurate patient data, should give the company a continuing competitive advantage over smaller operators, Emch said. The company began as a small, private-duty nursing service.</td>

 Facettenreich praesentiert sich die gegenstaendliche Kunst. Bendicht Fivians "Zimmermond" spielt mit Licht und Schatten in einem gespenstisch leeren Innenraum. Um innen und aussen, bezogen auf den Menschen, geht es auch bei Pierre Raetz und Peter Emch. Mit dem Gleichgewicht ringen Werner Ignaz Jans kaum handgrosse, kantig geschnitzte Holzfiguren trotz der massiven Sockel, auf denen sie stehen. Bandagen verhuellen und vereinnahmen Barbara Grafs subtil gezeichnete Koerper.</td>
