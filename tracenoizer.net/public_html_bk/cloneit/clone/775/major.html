 It was not only the legendary, well known Bobby Jones who put Augusta on the map. It was probably more the intensely private and very unusual Cliff Roberts who conceived the Club and fanatically nurtured it. Every controversy and major event surrounding the Club and this uniquely American event is surfaced, and treated comprehensively and fairly. In this day and electronic age, it is a pleasure to read someone who has such a command of the English language that he can make it stand up and bark. Anyone who appreciates great writing and is even remotely interested in golf or America, for that matter, should buy this book.</td>
