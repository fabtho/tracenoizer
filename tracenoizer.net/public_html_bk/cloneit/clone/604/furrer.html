<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" . Researchers at Zurich Zoo have put their young Galapagos tortoises on a diet after discovering that some of the animals weigh 10 times as much as those in the wild, and that all the Zurich tortoises were heavier than their counterparts in the Galapagos Islands. The tortoises are now being given food that is lower in energy content and higher in fibre in an attempt to slow their growth, said zoo curator Samuel Furrer in a statement late Wednesday. He added that there was no evidence that their weight was affecting the tortoises' internal organs or that there was a buildup of fat. Twenty-nine tortoises have been born at Zurich Zoo since it began its research project in 1989.">

 Honegger den Medienvertretern seine geliebten Schlangen, Echsen und Froesche vor. Honegger im Zoo Zuerich Amphibien, Reptilien und Fische und hat sich in dieser Zeit weltweit als Fachmann einen Namen gemacht. "Sie sind nicht nett zum Anfassen" Am Donnerstag uebergab Honegger seine Schluessel an Samuel Furrer, seinen 32-jaehrigen Nachfolger, der zurzeit seine Dissertation ueber einheimische Flusskrebse abschliesst. "Reptilien sind Tiere, die man beachten muss; sie brauchen einen Anwalt, da sie nicht nett zum Anfassen sind", lautete Honeggers Fazit. " Der Vater pflegt die Brut Dass Kaltbluetler keineswegs "gruusig" sind, zeigen die schillernd gelben oder azurblauen Pfeilgiftfroesche.</td>
