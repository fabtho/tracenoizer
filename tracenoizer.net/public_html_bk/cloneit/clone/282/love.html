 "I would find that if I was to sing as Nicole, I couldn't do it. " Baz Luhrmann looks like redefining 'eclectic' with his Moulin Rouge soundtrack, writes Garry Maddox. To round it off Kidman and McGregor sing a medley of love songs from the likes of Whitney Houston, The Beatles and Bowie. In Los Angeles, where he is finishing the film's sound mix, the first single from the soundtrack is already attracting interest. A reworking of the disco hit Lady Marmalade, by Christina Aguilera, Mya, Pink and L'il Kim has become one of the most requested songs on American radio.</td>

 My daily work uniform is a jogging suit, although I do try to spiff myself up for my media image. I confess, that shot was designed for a purpose - to make me look like a "hot" author to match my stories. I don't have kids (except for my horse, who's the other love of my life besides my husband), so my time is much more my own than many women's. I treat my writing like a regular job, probably because I have this great fear that if I don't succeed, I'll have to go back to work in the real world to earn a living - maybe making Pampers diapers and Charmin toilet tissue like I did in my previous life. I've always loved horses, but as an Army brat who moved around a lot, I couldn't have one of my own except for a short period when I was a teen.</td>
