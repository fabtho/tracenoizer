 We are going to be relocating back to Williamsport in the near future. I am currently working for a Telephone Interconnect company as office manager since 1996. I also schedule customer service calls, answer phones, process UPS orders, and order all supplies. While residing in Williamsport I worked as a Dental Office Coordinator for three years, and a Department Manager at the Bon Ton for seven years. I do not necessarily have to be in an office environment, I am very flexible.</td>
