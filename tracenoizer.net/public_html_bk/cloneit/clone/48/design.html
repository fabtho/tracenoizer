And you don't realize that when you've never worked before, because you don't have the skills to even begin to appreciate Utopia. When you go out into the world and practice design, and you're under the pressure of work, then you realize the value of having time to explore things.

 People want to imagine their own heroes, to involve their own creativity. In the age of multimedia, Internet, and soon interactive television, the reader can no longer remain passive. Using many different fonts in different sizes and different leading, and combining them with chaotic images, did not clarify design. The narcissistic attitude of some designers also contributes to the fragmentation of communication. The reader, then, perceives separate elements instead of a complex unified sensory experience.</td>
