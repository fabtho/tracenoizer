For the first time, the graphic designers from China contributed in large numbers (31). Among the prize winners, Switzerland stands out with 4 awards from a total of 15. Surprisingly, none of the many excellent designs from Japan found the jury's favor this year. Thank you, jury member Kari Piippo, for correcting my mistake.">
