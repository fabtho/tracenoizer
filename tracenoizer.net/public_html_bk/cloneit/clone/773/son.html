 For more detailed information on the Society please go to about us. For your general information here is a brief summary of the Strauss Dynasty. Johann Strauss I (1804-1849) was the son of an innkeeper. Largely self-taught as a musician, he developed the waltz in the form and style we associate with the family. He wrote 251 opus numbered works (out of a total of over 300), among them 153 waltzes, the most famous of which is Lorelei-Rheinklaenge (Sounds of the Rhine Loreley) (1843).</td>
