 The research, based on interviews with more than 800 six-year-olds in America, also shows that those youngsters who see their father as supportive have a greater sense of social acceptance. A separate study in a book published in Britain this week also suggests that boys adjust better after divorce when they live with their fathers rather than their mothers. In the American study, Howard Dubowitz and his team looked at how children viewed their fathers and how their support was linked to how well they were doing. In various ways mothers have unwittingly discouraged men. When, for example, both parents bring in kids to see the doctor there is an assumption that the woman has all the information, and not the father.</td>
