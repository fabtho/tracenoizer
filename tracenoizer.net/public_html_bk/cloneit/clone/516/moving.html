 Knapp also thanked IMS President Tony George for his vision, without which Knapp said he would not have had the opportunity to compete in the Indy 500. ISM Racing chief mechanic Gary Armentrout provided Knapp a set-up for the race similar to that in qualifying, which allowed Knapp to move from his 23rd starting spot to 17th by lap 10, 13th by lap 20 and seventh by lap 30. At the 250 mile mark, Knapp remained seventh, before moving into third by lap 120. Knapp fell back to sixth by lap 140, but fought his way back to third by lap 160, where he stayed until the twin checkered flags came out. Already a Pro Sports 2000 Champion in 1987, Knapp created Elite Engines, a top F2000 engine builder, in the early 1990s before hooking-up with client John Miller for the 1996 U.</td>

 Kapil could have waited a few days before cracking the whip but the disastrous performance on the first day probably forced him to be stern earlier than expected. He has been talking to players, telling them about his and the country's expectations and how they need to work hard to fulfill them. He is prepared to make some allowances -- no bar on moving out till a certain time and allowing wives to be with the team. But on the field, he expects total commitment to the game. It is too premature to say whether his methods will work or not but there is no doubt that Kapil is aware that his job is not easy, and to achieve his goal, he is willing to confront the establishment.</td>
