 His tongue-lashing may have had a chastening effect on superstars like Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and Saurav Ganguly. There may be many who may dislike Kapil's ways -- perhaps, more outsiders than the players themselves -- butthe former Indian captain is definitely trying to instill a sense of discipline in the team and sending a signal to those running the game in this country that he would brook no interference in the team's day-to-day affairs. The dressing room has been declared out of bounds for everyone -- he is reluctant to let even the selectors walk in when the game is on. Players will no longer be chased by journalists and photographers and the hotel lobby will not overflow with onlookers. He is trying to do what none of the previous Indian coaches did.</td>
