 . Bach Johann Christian Bach (1735 - 1782) The 11th son of J. Bach and the youngest to live to maturity, Johann Christian received his early musical training from his father, than whom music has spawned no greater genius. Thereupon he studied with his brother Carl Philipp Emanuel. Four years later he left for Italy, where he continued his studies and won a patron.</td>

 1 Perhaps one of the most neglected of Bach's works in this genre is the relatively obscure clavier transcription (BWV 964) of the A minor Sonata for solo violin (BWV 1003). One of only four surviving clavier sonatas by Bach, the work is a fascinating essay in the art of transcription and is particularly instructive for guitarists as it provides a first-hand look at the concerns and priorities that influenced Bach's compositional process, and resolves some of the more problematical aspects of adapting Bach's music for the guitar. How much, for instance, should technical considerations influence musical content. To what extent do different instrumental idioms play a part in Bach's musical thinking. This study proposes to examine these issues through a comparative analysis of the two versions of the sonata.</td>
