 It chronicles the events, members, and experiences of the Gideon Family. Of course, claiming to be The Gideon Family is an exercise in hubris, if not arrogance. But why should this author disappoint those that have come to expect a certain level of behavior. Granted there are other families of the Gideon name; none are mine. We're experimenting with different formats in which to display ourselves, so this page is subject to drastic changes at odd moments.</td>
