 Family stories indicate that Gideon had a brother, Hiram, and was the son of Josiah Drake. However, I have no additional information on Josiah, Hiram, or Gideon's mother. I would love to hear from anyone who might have information or stories on either the ancestors or descendants of Gideon. Katie (Blackmore) Gudgel And thank you Roy for posting this. .</td>

 Bill Bright God loves you and created you to know Him personally. (references contained on this Home Page are linked to the actual verses from the Bible, and should be read in context wherever possible. Man is sinful and separated from God, so we cannot know Him personally or experience His love. Man was created to have fellowship with God; but, because of his own stubborn self-will, he chose to go his own independent way and fellowship with God was broken. This self-will, characterized by an attitude of active rebellion or passive indifference, is an evidence of what the Bible calls sin.</td>
