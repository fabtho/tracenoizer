 My other favorite form of communication is Packet Radio beginning in 1987. On air for the first time using a PC-XT, KPC-2 TNC and IC-4N, connected to the "ZeroNet", a packet radio network in the Jakarta area. In 1996 I awarded a first class of Amateur Radio Commendation fromMinistry of Post Telecommunications and Tourism. At present I am as a member of Advisory Council of ORARI DKI Jakarta. From 1991 to date my activities in amateur radio slowed down, my job in the IT department and playing with my childrentook much of my spare times.</td>
