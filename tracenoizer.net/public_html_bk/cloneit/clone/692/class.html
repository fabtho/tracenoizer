It may be in your best interest as a design student to subscribe to this digest and continue to check it regularly. It has been used as the fastest official publication of design class enrollment options for the upcoming quarter, so you can get your classes faster using this email list. Other times, it is the best way to receive "party info" or "visiting speaker info" besides happening upon Xeroxed fliers in the CDA. It is also the best way to broadcast anything else (not job related) if you want to make it known.</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="1"<td valign="bottom"> It takes only a brief conversation with the professor of landscape architecture and city and regional planning to discover that these objects are the artifacts of a changing field that now uses computer modeling to design waterfronts, plazas, roadways and all the other elements that define an urban environment. What is remarkable is not that computer technology has invaded planning, architecture and design, or that Trancik identified this trend and realized his urban design students needed sophisticated computing skills to successfully enter the professional job market. What is remarkable is that his revitalized urban design studio class has, in three short semesters, become almost totally computerized and that his teaching methodology has been transformed in response to the learning opportunities provided by emerging technologies. In 1994 he set out to educate himself about specialized computer applications and design techniques and to develop a new approach to teaching. He used his sabbatical leave to learn about digital 3D modeling, computer graphics and image manipulation software.</td><td valign="center"><img height="115" width="170" src="http://www.ryerson.ca/info/campus/quadtree.jpg"></td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1"><td valign="bottom"> A student may use the system to view their degree, thesis title, and expected use the system to completion date at any time. The Task Develop the analysis and design for a university system using ArgoUML (where possible - objects in the activity diagrams acn be added by hand). Produce a use-case diagram, activity diagrams for all use-cases, class and package diagrams, and a state diagram for the UndergraduateStudent class. You may work in groups of up to 3 people on this assignment, but no group may be a superset or subset (in the non-strict sense, i. , including set equality) of any group from the first assignment.</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4"<td valign="center"> How to Use the Learning Factory ILF Mission and Access Policies General Guidelines for Using the Learning Factory Access Agreement and User Account Application (PDF file) How to Use the Design Lab How to Become a User Software in the Design Lab Design Lab User Account Application (PDF file) How to Use the Product Dissection Lab General Lab Guidelines Product Dissection Lab Workstations How to Use the Design Studio Design Studio Tips and Guidelines Design Studio Workstation Using the Smart Board . .
