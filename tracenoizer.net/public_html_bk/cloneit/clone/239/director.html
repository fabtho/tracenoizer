 Unceremoniously informed last year that the 51st Berlin Fest which gets underway on Wednesday February 7 for a run through February 18 would be his last, de Hadeln has made no secret of his ire with officials who decided he had to go after two decades. The 60-year-old de Hadeln made it clear he will not miss some of the prima donna stars who have come to dominate the Berlin and Cannes festivals, overshadowing the actual films. But it's got to the point where it's sometimes more important who walks down the red carpet than what's being shown up on the screen,'' the Berlin fest director said.

 And, like it or not, the Berlinale needs them - and their stars - to draw public and media attention. It all ends badly but, in the meantime, there is sex galore on screen. The Swamp, a first film by Lucrecia Martel, a young Argentine director, is similarly narrowly focused. Set in the soporific summer heat of northwestern Argentina, it has no plot as such, but instead shows the melancholic and depressed life of Argentina's collapsing middle classes through an alcoholic woman, her decadent philandering husband and a bevy of children and relatives who are variously dysfunctional or trying to escape a vacation from hell. But unlike the first Dogma films, Thomas Vinterberg's Celebration and Lars von Triers' Idiots, which told dark tales, Italian for Beginners is a very funny romantic comedy in which a half-dozen solitary souls come together around Italian lessons held in a small town's auditorium.</td>

 Using archive material--some of which is shown publicly for the first time--and interviews with survivors, their relatives and US troops who liberated the camps, the film deals in a workman-like manner with the experiences of five Hungarians Jews who were victims of the effort by the Nazis in the closing stages of the war to implement a Final Solution. Hungary at that time possessed the largest Jewish community in all of Europe and despite--or perhaps because of--the clear signs that the war was being lost by Hitler's forces, an intensified campaign was organised by the Nazis to wipe out all remaining Jews in the country. A second documentary film dealing with the same subject was The Specialist by Israeli-born director Eyal Silvan who used new digital technologies to edit and rework in documentary form 350 hours of original videotape shot at the trial of Adolf Eichmann in Jerusalem in 1961. Eichmann was a lieutenant colonel in the SS with special responsibilities for the deportation and liquidation of the Jews. Escaping capture at the end of the war, Eichmann was eventually kidnapped by Israeli secret police from his hiding place in South America and put on trial.</td>
