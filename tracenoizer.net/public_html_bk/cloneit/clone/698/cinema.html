In this way, we wish to confirm our intention to promote the complementary nature of its role in relation to other comparable pan-European and national bodies. In this respect, the development of constructive joint activities between EURIMAGES and those bodies should be fostered; In particular, as Minister of Culture and Education of Hungary, I would wish that European cinema acquire a strong identity a distinctive feature. In addition, I would like to suggest a prize for the most successful films as they represent the only means to enhance the prestige of European cinematography. .</td><tr></table><br>further information: <a href="http://www.cinematograph.ch">http://www.cinematograph.ch</a><br><br></font><font size=-6> <a class="nav" href="">.</a><br><br></font></body></html>
