 Political change has created a surge of interest in cultural collaboration between practitioners in both halves of Europe. However, many in Central and Eastern European countries have been unable to take advantage of their new freedom to travel, because political change did not result in economic parity. Meanwhile, cultural practitioners in European Union countries began to test the reality of a so-called single 'European cultural space' and the right to free movement as internal frontiers were gradually dismantled following the Maastricht Treaty and membership was enlarged to 15 nations.
