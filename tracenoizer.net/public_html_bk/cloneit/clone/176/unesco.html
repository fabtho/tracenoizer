 It seems that this judgement concerns mainly the traditional type of agreements. On a more general level, Canada is also very much concerned with the trends that are creating an "international" focus all over the world - trends such as the spread of information technology and the international mobility of people.

 The bibliography should contain a 2-5 line explanation about what the book contains in English. This fact has certainly influenced a number of central governments to review their policies for culture and languages in the last two to three decades. In addition, regional and local authorities are beginning to assert their identity and expressions in favour of "diversity" provided by international bodies such as UNESCO, the Council of Europe and the European Union have resulted in increased regional powers, particularly in the field of promoting indigenous cultures and languages. The responses stretch across Europe from North to South to East to central countries and the diversity of approaches to the subject reminds us of the breadth of sub-subjects which can be gathered under the umbrella term of social cohesion. In many cases the way in which cultural policy is dealt with is clearly determined on response to specific demographical characteristics.</td>
