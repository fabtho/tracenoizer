You were right with the 2300 UT transmission in English on 15565 kHz. The intention of the Moscow relay is to cover not only Europe but also South America. A rebel radio transmitter was seized in a special operation conducted in Chechnya's Kurchaloy District. The person who used the transmitter to listen to the radio frequencies of federal troops and amend rebel activities accordingly has been arrested.</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="0"><td valign="top"> This information is from Bakerloo Line Working Timetable number 21, which was used from 28th September 1997.
