Another option might have been for some of the 12 trains to run Aldgate round trips only while the others alternated Aldgate and Baker Street round trips. This delay is not a problem if the service is infrequent or the terminus has several platforms, but several termini have only one or two platforms and very frequent services. Here it is desirable to eliminate this delay by having a new driver climbing in to the new front of the train while the old driver is climbing out of the old front. The new driver then drives the train away while the old driver is still walking up the platform.</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6"<td valign="top"> These leaflets also include a weekly overview of the feature programmes and the frequencies of all foreign language broadcasts to that target aera. . My question was if 'BBC Worldwide' - the monthly magazine of the World Service was the only way to get the frequencies used. The subscription of this magazine costs 24 pounds per year and is - in my eyes - too expensive for those people who only want to find out a useful frequency. The answer was that there are leaflets available free of charge that are published twice a year (the next edition covers the period from October to March).</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="4"<td valign="center"> The Secret Service has been known to occasionally use cellular communications. .
