 As Pacific standard time is behind all other time zones within the continental US, families from other time zones can also call after their normal work hours.

These communities recognize that the public health community can combine efforts with the early childhood community in order to create the best care for the millions of children in child care. To reinforce these efforts and to stimulate others nationwide, the Federal Child Care Bureau and the Maternal and Child Health Bureau have joined efforts to launch the Healthy Child Care America Campaign. The American Academy of Pediatrics, with support from the US Department of Health and Human Services Child Care Bureau and Maternal and Child Health Bureau, assumed coordination of the campaign in October 1996.</td>
