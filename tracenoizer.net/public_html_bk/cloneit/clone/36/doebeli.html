 The gin was moved approximately a quarter of a mile to the east and served the farming community well into the 20th century. In February 1875, Louis and Urban Bessard were given a lot on the square, right in the middle of the north side, for the consideration of building a good structure to house a blacksmith and gunsmith shop. Felix Doebeli put in a business to the east of them. The Wood brick plant was located on the east bank of Salt Creek just south and around the west bend from the Salt Works. The plant was owned and operated by John Henderson Wood who had served as Frontier Texas Ranger and Indian Scout at both Fort Belknap and Fort Phantom Hill during 1861.</td>
