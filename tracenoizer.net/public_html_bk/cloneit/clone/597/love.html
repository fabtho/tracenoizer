She is the carpet's spirit, and recounts the tale that is woven into the carpet. A story of love, longing, tradition and duty, Gabbeh is a visually stunning and tender work that also examines the role of women in Islamic society. As a young militant opposed to the Shah's regime in Iran, the director was involed in a clash with police and ended up serving five years in prison.
