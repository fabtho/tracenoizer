 A verbose procedural language designed for business applications. The use of COBOL cripples the mind; its teaching should, therefore, be regarded as a criminal offense. An elegant object oriented language, designed to support reuse, and including support for logical assertions.

 At first, it was devoted to functional programming. Now, I am very interested in the expressiveness of programming languages in general. With the term advanced I mean that it is oriented to researchers on programming languages . I would like to add a personal comment to each link, but sometimes, I prefer to leave it blank than to include a meaningless comment. Of course, this page will always be under construction.</td>
