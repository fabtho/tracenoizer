 opcodes) The most common A-code error Obsolete directives Introduction A-code is the adventure-writing language developed by Dave Platt for the adv550 superset of the original Adventure, and subsequently developed by myself, in working on the adv660 superset. A-code is not intended to be a programming language and hence as a programming language it is fairly primitive. Its strength are elsewhere - in supporting features such as text-switches or text-nesting. It also comes with a pre-programmed "skeleton" adventure template. This is written in A-code and implements lots of basic adventuring functionality, so that on the one hand you can get on with the meaty bits of your adventure straight away, while on the other if you want to give the standard parts a much more customised look, you can easily do that too.</td>

 Richard Stevens Explore similar items Editorial Reviews From Book News, Inc. Supplies details about the Internet protocol suite not covered by the first volume, which deals with principles, protocols, and architecture. The first few chapter could be used in an advanced undergraduate course on networking and the text as a whole for a graduate course that delves into some of the more esoteric aspects of TCP. Reflects changes in the protocol standards and updates the example code to ANSI standard C. Uses the widely-accepted data-mark interpretation of TCP urgent data and discusses the consequences.</td>

 Sanscript - Visual dataflow programming language and development environment. Composing occurs via visual programming interface to a dataflow network. To execute programs, users specify parameters by graphical user interface rather than traditional text-based datafiles. May be viewed as a computing workbench, where users can design and modify simulations interactively via a dataflow programming model. Visual Language Research Bibliography - Large, well structured bibliography of papers on visual language research, also has brief list of links to other visual language related research resources.</td>
