This book showcases the vanguard of new methods for object-oriented and component-based interactive system development, incorporating contributions from international experts in object modeling and human computer interaction. It shows how object modeling approaches can be modified to bring user interface concerns into the earliest stages of the software design life cycle, where they have the greatest possible effect on the subsequent system design and on the end system usability. The methods integrate the best applicable user interface design practice with object modeling techniques that use the Unified Modeling Language (UML).">
