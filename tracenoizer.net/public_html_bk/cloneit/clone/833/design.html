 . This book showcases the vanguard of new methods for object-oriented and component-based interactive system development, incorporating contributions from international experts in object modeling and human computer interaction. It shows how object modeling approaches can be modified to bring user interface concerns into the earliest stages of the software design life cycle, where they have the greatest possible effect on the subsequent system design and on the end system usability. The methods integrate the best applicable user interface design practice with object modeling techniques that use the Unified Modeling Language (UML). Within these broad overlapping areas, ten individual chapters cover specific topics, such as - Participatory modeling of business concepts by users - The use of scenarios and task descriptions to build object models of interactive systems - New notations for Structured Essential Use Cases in the Software For Use method - User interface design in the Rational Unified Process (RUP) - User-centered design approaches for interactive system design Object Modeling and User Interface Design merges theories with practical techniques to create methods for the design of today's systems.</td>

 We also discuss and examine a variety of the more important projects in the field over the last few years. . A variety of different design methodologies have arisen from these research efforts, and numerous visual programming systems have been developed to address both specific application areas, such as user interface design and physical simulation, and more general programming tasks. We present a survey of the field of visual programming languages beginning with an historical overview of some of the pioneering efforts in the field. In addition, we present different classifications of visual programming languages, touch on implementation and design issues, and discuss efforts to formalize the theoretical basis for visual languages.</td>

 This course is also for the CNE or Master CNE candidate. . Students will complete an NDS design strategy and implementation schedule using templates that they can re-use to create a design for their workplaces. Students will then use these strategies and schedules to complete a NetWare implementation in a hands-on environment. The processes taught in this course for creating a solid NetWare design have been proven in use with Novell Consulting Services.</td>
