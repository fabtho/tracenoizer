<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" If you use Photoshop for freehand illustration, you're probably already using one. If not, you can still use many of the techniques described with a mouse, albeit with less control. Creating painterly illustrations from photographs in a sketch or watercolor style is well covered, as are manipulating and retouching photographs to change atmosphere, create multilayered compositions, or add depth or style. Compositing techniques using Photoshop's live effects give a designer great latitude, and the tutorials using text and live effects are especially worthwhile. The Magic series of books from New Riders Publishing is an outstanding collection, with no expense spared in layout or production.">

 As for the "blazing rock", a new project is on the horizon. I miss being on stage, as I haven't played live since my last band inploded in 1998. How, do you think, does the internet (or mp3) change the music industry. In the past two years, the whole playing field has been changed. Mp3 has certainly been beneficial for me, though I can see the fear that some may feel.</td>
