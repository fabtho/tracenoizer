 . Betsy Ross, Joseph Richman After Suicide by John H. It is the author's intent that reading this will be an experience which enhances life; one which will help make the encounter with grief not only more bearable, but actually growth-producing. I don't know if survivors of other faiths would share in this or be uncomfortable about the multiple references to Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. I could also see anyone who is really ANGRY at God right now for the suicide of their loved one being irrate at the references but, may find it helpful later on in their grieving process.</td>
