 A teen-age basketball player collapses during practice. These crisis situations require getting information to emergency personnel fast, but what's the best way to deliver it. That was the problem presented to 25 Stanford University Business and Engineering school students in an innovative class designed to develop their ability to construct electronic business processes. The concept for the course originated with Sian last year while he was completing his doctorate in the Design Division of the Engineering School. Over the 10 weeks of winter quarter, each team designed an Internet or Intranet-based system that an organization can use to respond to a crisis.</td>
