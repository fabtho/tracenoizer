 . Conference Homepage Analytical Aspects and Practical Pitfalls in Technical Applications of Automatic Differentiation presented by Florian Dignath Institute B of Mechanics, University of Stuttgart joint research withDr. The first analysis investigates the application of threshold and maximum--value optimization criteria in direct representation using AD for the sensitivity analysis. Secondly, an adaptive cruise controller of a vehicle convoy is optimized with respect to control error and control effort. Two experimental cars equipped with state-of-the- art sensors and actuators are used to verify the designed controllers.</td>

 AD methods can be used whenever gradient information or higher-order derivative information must be computed. The problem is defined by a computer program (without gradient information) that is able to compute numerical values of some output variables for a given set of input variables. The application of AD methods to this computer program results in the automatic generation of a new computer program, which computes the derivatives of the output variables with respect to the input variables. Recent experience with AD tools has shown that both the implementation and the algorithmic frameworks need to be expanded, with an eye toward exploiting the strengths of these different approaches. Thus, the myriad possibilities of computing derivatives that arise from the associativity of the chain rule and the challenges for building systems that combine runtime and compile-time techniques provide a fertile ground for future challenging research.</td>

 Work of younger scientists is distinguished primarily from countries, in which applied mathematics and mechanics will represent substantially by the GAMM. University teachers and persons are suggestion-entitled in appropriate positions in the research. Also the possibility of the own application is given. Suggestions or applications are to be addressed to the presidents of the GAMM. The next date for suggestions and applications is 30 September each yearly.</td>
