The purpose of this study is to identify ways in which income security policies affect mothers differently and to outline life-course trajectories that are most likely to lead to poverty among women. Our results indicate that mothers' choices about work and family shape, and are shaped by, broader gender arrangements that prioritize motherhood and marriage over economic independence. We conclude that until social policies address systemic gender inequality, neither marriage nor employment (alone or in combination) will be enough to reduce significantly women's economic insecurity. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This study was motivated by the changes to the administration and funding of social programs across Canada since 1995 - changes that were brought about by the introduction of the Canada Health and Social Transfer (CHST).</td><td valign="bottom"><img height="175" width="679" src="http://womhist.binghamton.edu/bar.gif"></td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="5"><td valign="top"><img height="126" width="100" src="http://womhist.binghamton.edu/links/smith.jpg"></td><td valign="bottom"> Women, Gender, Sexualty - includes articles and links regarding women's issues in Turkey and elsewhere. .

This session is held by the regional office for the urban development program in the Arab states in association with the Arab forum of information on environment and development and the center of research, studies, documentation and information on women (CREDIF). The first session saw the presentation of activities of the regional office for urban development in Tunis to reinforce complementarity and coordination between the various fields of urban development in the Arab world, the reinforcement of the contribution of cities to economic development, the reduction of pockets of poverty notably among women as well as the creation of a network of experts specialized in this field.
