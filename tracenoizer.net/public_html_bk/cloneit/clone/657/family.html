 Daylight photos are especially suspect because of the ease with which a suspended model can be made to look realistically distant, and due to the lack of complex luminosity which must be simulated. In this paper, I review the evidence for a hoax, point out some inconsistencies, and leave it to the reader to decide. , hang it up with a string, and if the photo turned out good, we could play a joke on our family and friends to see their reaction and then tell them the truth. Then we wrapped plain white thread with paper tape around two poles several times, and then taped the model to the threads. I was reluctant to waste the film, because I thought the threads and tape would be visible on the photo.</td>
