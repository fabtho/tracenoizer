 For many of us, staying in the closet can seem the safest way to avoid both rejection--from co-workers, friends, and family--and conflict. But even those who freely express their gayness find that it's virtually impossible to avoid society's negative attitudes. And stress is a main reason so many gay men and women look for escape in a bottle--or in a line of cocaine or a joint. A look at the numbers can put things into sharper perspective. Studies show that at least two million gay men and lesbians abuse alcohol and as many as 30 percent will need treatment at some point in their lives--three times the odds facing the general population.</td>
