 . Wishing everyone a happy and healthy holiday season. We are a group of gay men, lesbians, bisexuals and their friends that live in the Edgewater, New Jersey area. We started this to meet others in the area that share our lifestyle. We were able to enjoy Jono's in privacy for the afternoon.</td>

 , each book must be in subject 1 AND subject 2 AND . . For the time being, says Evan Gerstmann, gays and lesbians facing discrimination "can only win by appealing to judicial sympathy and intuitions about fairness rather than by invoking any coherent legal principle. " But, he continues, the struggle for class-based gay and lesbian rights should not be considered an issue unto itself, but should be looked at within the entire field of "equal protection" jurisprudence. In that context, we learn that the courts have been reluctant to expand the boundaries of class-based protection to include any new group in more than two decades.</td>

 McNeill speaks from personal experience as a gay man. He says the church first forced him to abandon his ministry to gay and lesbian Catholics and ultimately pushed him out of his religious order about a decade ago. The Catholic church is trying to come to terms with gays and lesbians in its pews. bishops issued a statement saying that, despite the official position of disapproval, the church does not expect parents to choose between their faith and their gay and lesbian children. On Saturday, conservative theologians questioned the morality of certain sexual behavior.</td>
