 I have been looking for a place to feel grounded and loved, and I feel in my heart and soul I have found it. Thank you for stepping into my life at the right time. Archangel Michael has helped me a lot and I love him so much. Sometimes you have to get kicked off the cloud to get moving and creating again. Hard to be the cloud kicker but it was done in love.</td>

 My family consists of David, my husband of 35 years, and 2 wonderful daughters, Lisa and Lori. I have had a lot of success with my genealogy, thanks to the wonderful "cousins" that I have found on the Internet. Please check my surnames, and if you think that we may have a connection, I would love to hear from you. At the bottom of this page is a Guest Book, please sign it and let me know what you think. Leave that "elusive" ancestor that you are having problems with, and maybe someone will find a connection to you.</td>

 . You are so sweet, undoing all that we've done trying to get them to sleep in their own bed. I secretly think you enjoy their cuddles as much as they love sleeping in every known position known to man especially if it is on top of you. I just wanted you to know that you are doing a wonderful job being a daddy. Please visit the Talking Page for the new location for this board, or click here to read about the changes.</td>
