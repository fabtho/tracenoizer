 . Mother keeping children from father Click buttons above to go to sites. 10 Comments My boyfriend's ex wife is purposely and maliciously keeping their sons ages 3 and 8 away from him. She throws the children off on other family members so she can go out drinking, but refuses to let them stay with their dad. The lawyers have still not set temporary custody proceedings and he hasn't seen his sons in 6 weeks.</td>

Your wife and your kids are out there, and they take your blood type and say, "Wait here in the parking lot. If we call your name, you can be dismissed and go home. " You stand around with your neighbors; frightened, wondering what in the world is going on, thinking this could be the end of the world.</td>
