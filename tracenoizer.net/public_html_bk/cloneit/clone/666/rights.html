 . McDonagh, Department of Political Science, Northeastern University. FETAL RIGHTS, WOMEN'S RIGHTS by Suzanne Uttaro Samuels is an unusually strong analysis of how the law deals with the intersection of women's reproductive rights and their employment rights in American society.

Anthony, and a myriad of lesser-known women of the times write their autobiographical experiences of the often threatening, always challenging era of accomplishing equal rights for women.
