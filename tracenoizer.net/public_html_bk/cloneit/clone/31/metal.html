<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" Italian design had little real influence on German design until Memphis appeared on the scene in the early 1980s. Ettore Sottsass was the best loved of all with his coloured plastic laminate panels for Abet Laminati, among the most popular creations of the Memphis era, whose "violently" decorated surfaces graced many a German furnishing product. However, young German designers quickly opposed the colourful Italian trend with their own austerely unexuberant plain MDF and untreated metal furnishings. Today both Germany and Italy offer a range of different design trends, as the understated elegance of new modesty and the back-to-nature philosphy of ecological design develop in parallel with bright colours, pale wood and new man-made materials. Who can now tell the difference between German and Italian design.">
