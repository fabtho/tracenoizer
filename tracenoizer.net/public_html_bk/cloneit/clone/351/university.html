 In addition, an analysis is being conducted of several series of breast cancer families in order to determine the incidence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in minority populations and in women with multiple primary cancers. Finally, they are working collaboratively to assess at risk families, without BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, in a search for other breast cancer related genes. , is a Professor of Medicine and Genetics at the University of Pennsylvania and the director of the Cancer Risk Evaluation Program and the Breast Cancer Program at the University of Pennsylvania Cancer Center. ..</td>

 So far, I can only go back to Caleb Cushing Weber and his father, Emile Weber. I bookmarked you so I can read more about you when I come back next time. You see, I am a student at the University of New Mexico and was procrastinating with my chemistry homework, so decided to jump on the net. I typed my name in a search query and your family page came up with a positive match for "jose weber". I bet you'll be glad to know that in the 21 years that I've been alive, I've never met nor heard of another Jose Weber.</td>
