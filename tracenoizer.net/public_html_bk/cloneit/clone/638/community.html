 Peer Review The Peer Review Process Exerpts from Major Articles Scholarly Publishing, Peer Review, and the Internet Peter Roberts considers possible futures for serials in cyberspace (from First Monday). Stevan Harnad is probably the most influential figure advocating electronic forms of scholarly writing and peer review. His vision and outspoken views on the peer review process has enabled the scholarly community to begin considering differences between the electronic and print media for scholarly publishing, including affordances of speed and interaction. Harnad coined the expression Scholarly Skywriting (1990) to depict a continuous, interactive process in which an original work is published along side rebuttals and commentary. The original is revised, eliciting new commentary and fresh rebuttals in a contiuing dialectic cycle.</td>
