 Providing costing information to general practitioners -- will this intervention change behaviour and create cost savings. . Search Internet Peer Review Study II In this study of new methods of peer review, articles submitted for publication are circulated to reviewers via the world wide web (using password-protected access) and the review process is conducted as an online discussion between the journal editors, reviewers, authors and a small panel of consultants who represent a wider range of expertise and journal readership. When an article is accepted for publication, both the article and the record of its review process are rapidly published on the world wide web for open review by the Journal's readers. After four weeks of open review, the article is finalised and published in print.</td>

 Soon closed peer review will look as anachronistic as unsigned editorials. . Time to open up the black box of peer review See News p 766 As recently as 10 years ago we had almost no evidence on peer review, a process at the heart of science. Then a small group of editors and researchers began to urge that peer review could itself be examined using scientific methods. The result is a rapidly growing body of work, much of it presented at the third international congress on peer review held in Prague last week.</td>
