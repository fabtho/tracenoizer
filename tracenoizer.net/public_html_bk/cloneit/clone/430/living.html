The most helpful and useful one is the Gideon Family Medical Clinic. People living in Gideon can now visit a doctor or nurse practitioner, if needed, without having the hassle of traveling a long distance. If a patient would need a prescription filled, Overturf Pharmacy is available in the same building.
