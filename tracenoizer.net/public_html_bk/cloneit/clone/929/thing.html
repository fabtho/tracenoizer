 Thing understands the allure of a Red Light Neighbourhood where old woman sit on the curb talking about their conquests with men who came from tin ships deep under the seas surface; and where hookers of various gender line the street corners, constructing a pure will out of novel sexuality. . Thing likes a bit of Red Light action Thing Understands. Thing understands the impulse to run away from the suburban, structured, anticipated suburbs, to a place that looks like people are actually alive. Thing knows what it is like to go to a bar where dirty poles take the place of happy balloons, to walk down a dark alley where nothing echoes in an empty niceness, and everything is garnished with human use (and garlic).</td>
