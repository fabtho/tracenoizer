 My weary friend unintentionally uttered the absolute truth in that sick-bed sentence. There are no detours around them or shortcuts over them. All the power of positive thinking you can muster will not take the hard edge off hard things. All the silver-lining-in-every-cloud cliches you can recite will not make that which is truly hard into something soft or easy.
