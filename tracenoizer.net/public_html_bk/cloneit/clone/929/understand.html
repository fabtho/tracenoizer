 . PREGNANT 2 VoyForums staff have been using the PainEase for over two years. I don't think I have ever had an annovulatory cycle (as I understand the meaning) except once about 13 years ago. I was over 2 weeks late just like last cycle and thought I would never start but finally did. Other than that I have never skipped a month or been late a month (more than a couple of days) in my entire adult life.</td>

" -Part 1 Why Are Some Things "Hard to be Understood. " -Part 1Because the Basics Come First by Tim Nichols There are two clear principles in the Bible that are sometimes pitted against each other. Reflecting upon these two principles, we cannot help wondering what elements cause some truths to be "hard to be understood" while others are not so difficult to understand. If all revealed truth is subject to being understood, what is to be done with those passages that are not easily understood. That would be the reasonable conclusion only if they were impossible to understand.</td>
