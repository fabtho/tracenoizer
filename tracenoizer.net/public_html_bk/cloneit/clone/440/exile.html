Our struggle must remain non-violent and free of hatred. " -- Dalai Lama, Tibetan leader AS LEADER of the Tibetan people His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, leads a life of exile in India. After an uprising against Chinese rule 42 years ago, the Dalai Lama fled, followed by thousands of Tibetans. Over the decades the 66-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner and advocate of non-violence has continued to seek "genuine autonomy" for his homeland, a land that China considers to be an integral part of its territory.</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="5"><td valign="top"> As Westerners in greater and greater numbers learn of Tibetan culture and study Tibetan Buddhism, the Chinese government is increasingly preventing the practice of religion inside Tibet. As Westerners look to the Dalai Lama as a symbol of world peace, children inside Tibet are detained and tortured for repeating the words "Long Live the Dalai Lama". The Film Festival opens with "Compassion in Exile", both an intimate portrait of the 14th Dalai Lama and a moving look at the brutal treatment endured by the Tibetan people. This is followed by the film that helped create the myth, Frank Capra's "Lost Horizon". The programme, over the course of the following day, offers a rich selection of archival and contemporary films from opposite ends of the spectrum.</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3"<td valign="center"> Turn off images if your connection is too slow -- the best images can be downloaded by clicking on their place-holders. .
