 Our struggle must remain non-violent and free of hatred. " -- Dalai Lama, Tibetan leader AS LEADER of the Tibetan people His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, leads a life of exile in India. After an uprising against Chinese rule 42 years ago, the Dalai Lama fled, followed by thousands of Tibetans. Over the decades the 66-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner and advocate of non-violence has continued to seek "genuine autonomy" for his homeland, a land that China considers to be an integral part of its territory. The Chinese believe communism liberated the Tibetans from a feudal theocracy led by the Dalai Lamas and that Tibet has developed considerably under their rule.</td>

 ) Maybe most transforming for the Austrian, though, is the rude shock of discovering that a beautiful Tibetan maiden prefers his less good-looking friend over himself as a husband. As a story about learning to be less selfish, this is all pleasant enough. But the movie does allow glimpses into turbulent Tibetan life as the Chinese step up their encroachments prior to their 1951 invasion. Of course, the sympathies of the film are entirely with the Tibetans; the Chinese are represented emblematically as oafs who would be capable of grinding their heels in one of those lovely Buddhist sand mandalas. Although one Tibetan official is singled out as a traitor, this is a device to allow the reformed Brad Pitt character to denounce him.</td>

 "Having come to India as a refugee and having received the status of a refugee, I will only go back to China with his Holiness the Dalai Lama," he said. As the head of the powerful Kagyu sect, which has its seat at the Rumtek monastery in the northeastern state of Sikkim, the Karmapa is viewed by some as the third highest ranking lama in Tibetan Buddhism. When the news of his escape broke, the Chinese authorities said he had left a note, saying he had only left temporarily to collect the "black hat" -- the 'crown' of the Kagyu sect -- and various sacred musical instruments. At Friday's press conference, the Karmapa ridiculed the Chinese version. "I said in the letter that I had asked for permission to travel internationally and not received it," he said.</td>
