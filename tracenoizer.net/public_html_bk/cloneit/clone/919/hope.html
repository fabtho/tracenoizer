 He lurches from one scrape to another in his encounters with two skinheads, a crooked bank manager, and a compulsive shop-lifter. Many of the adults he meets have a grim story, laced with an element of black farce, and their vivid cameo appearances make clear to the reader what Waldemar will soon leave behind. For them the trials are real, ongoing, and offer no hope of escape. Chief among the book's very positive virtues is its sharp visual sense. It captures superbly well Vienna's buildings, parks and streets, with vigorous thumbnail sketches and a sharp eye for different people's characteristic gait and gestures.</td>

 Perhaps someone will slip LSD into the water glasses of the Honorable Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States, and they'll suddenly precipitate crisis by reading the Constitution before handing down an important ruling. I don't care if you've been doing your calisthenics. Its about letting go of the forlorn hope that Bubba or his successors or their cohorts will let real change take place on their watch, that they'll give up the house edge and play fair, and that the meek shall inherit the earth. Because when the fecal matter intercepts the oscillating blades, it is not going to be a pretty sight. Not because he's in your house and threatening your life, but because he's continually asserted his right to, and because he's done it to others.</td>

 'I was the girl on campus that you'd look at and think, "There's no way this girl's coming to Christ", but I guess God proved His point', she says candidly. Though Jennifer was at college on a music scholarship for trumpet she began to play around on an acoustic guitar and soon began pouring out pensive songs of mixed emotion. The harsh childhood realities and struggles of her teen years combined with a new hope and faith, soon revealed her as an incisive, penetrating lyricist and powerful communicator. Beyond the level of 'self-therapy', she began performing for friends and soon found herself holding her own in local venues. One thing led to another and after a chance performance in front of dc Talk's Toby McKeehan she was soon signed to his new label, Gottee and released her debut album to extraordinarily high acclaim.</td>
