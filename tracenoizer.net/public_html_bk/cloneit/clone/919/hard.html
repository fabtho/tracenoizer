 Knapp, 34, who began driving sports cars in 1985, was the highest-finishing rookie among eight first-year starters in Sunday's race. One of his teammates at ISM Racing, Jeff Ward, was the Rookie of the Year last year. "It's hard for me to keep from crying, but it's been a long road to get here," said Knapp, who had never before driven in an Indy-car race. " Knapp was a test team coordinator for Mario and Michael Andretti in 1988-90, but was out of racing for the next five years. Formula 2000 championship in 1996 and drove the Toyota Atlantic Series last year, with a best finish of second at Vancouver, British Columbia.</td>

 . I don't follow the monthly series, but whenever a new collection is on the shelves, I'm among the first in line to read the further adventures of John Constantine, the resident attitudinal mage of the DC universe. Unfortunately, Hard Time was a horrible disappointment. The book begins with Constantine's admission into a tough American prison after being convicted of murder. I certainly believe there's a place for ugly stories in this world; they often need to be told.</td>

 In all cases we have grown companies from ground zero, and I think one of the hallmarks has been to keep the small company attitude, even when the company gets quite large. We found that, over the years, that attitude pretty much works its way into both your marketing and your customer service. When you ask people to work as hard as we do in a growth environment, you need to create a good and nurturing environment for them as well. I would say that most of my time is actually spent on strategy and operations. As I mentioned, those costs are principally after our interconnect costs, which is really the cost of the services we provide.</td>
