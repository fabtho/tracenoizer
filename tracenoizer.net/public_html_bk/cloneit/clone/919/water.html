 We simply have too much brush out there, unless you pave everything over, and that's not going to happen. " One difference between the fires of 1996 and 1993 is the way they were fought. These include more powerful helicopters to carry more water and an airplane that can deliver big loads of water scooped from the Pacific. As for John Macht, he returned to find his house still standing. We could have been those people, so thank God, we aren't.</td>

 If the area is going to be mowed, a mesh that will degrade rapidly should be selected. Anchored mulches can be used in low-flow swales (depressions or drainages) or wetland fringes where flow-induced shear stress does not exceed 1. Hydraulically applied mulches (hydromulches) typically consist of wood or paper fiber mixed with water, seed, and fertilizer. Both can be combined with chemical bonding agents to improve short-term stability and attachment to the soil (Lancaster, ND; North American Green, 1995). Meshes Erosion control meshes are open weave geotextiles consisting of jute, coconut, or polypropylene.</td>

 The outer arc around each ship is drawn with a radius of 16 miles, which is approximately the farthest distance at which the curvature of the earth would have permitted the side lights of the Titanic to be seen by a person at the height of the side lights of the Californian, or at which the side lights of the Californian could have been seen by a person at the height of the side lights of the Titanic. The inner circle around each ship is drawn with a radius of 7 miles. This is approximately the distance after reaching which the curvature of the earth would have shut out the side lights of the Californian from the view of one in a lifeboat in the water. It appears, therefore, that if the Titanic's position at the time of the accident was as fixed by the testimony and if it was the side light of the Californian that was seen from the boat deck of the Titanic, the Californian was somewhere inside of the arc of the 16-mile circle drawn about the Titanic. It further appears that if the above hypothesis be correct and if the side light of the other steamer could not be seen, as is testified to, from one of the lifeboats of the Titanic after being lowered, the Californian was somewhere outside of the circle with the 7-mile radius drawn about the Titanic.</td>
