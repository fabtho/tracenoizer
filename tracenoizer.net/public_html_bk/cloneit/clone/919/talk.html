<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" If you're not willing to watch for the target of opportunity, to seize day, even against the possibility of failure, you're urinating into the gale. Its fun to toss around what-ifs and why-fors and to look forward to Der Tag, safely tucked away in the future of Keynes long run. The militia movement that was so active earlier in this decade learned the hard way what happens when you talk the talk but refuse to get out of your easy chair and go for a stroll. Those who envision change by political means may be right and they may be wrong, but they are working within a system where the rules allow them to feel confident that their existence, if not their success, is assured. The dropouts live a little closer to the edge, facing harassment and persecution for acting on their beliefs -- but they're unlikely to perform their last dance at the end of a rope if they fail in their attempt to.">

 . We try to move as many processes outside the close and to do as many tasks as possible in advance of the closing process. At one time, we used to talk about taking days out of the cycle. Then we started talking about taking hours out of the cycle. Lifting tasks outside the close relieves that pressure and helps improve both the cycle time and quality.</td>

 You can supervise the play and correct your daughter's friend when she's out of line. If the problems come back, you'll know that your house is the safer place to play. If the problem continues, have your neighbor over for coffee to talk things through. Having a neighbor friend was important to me as a child as well.
