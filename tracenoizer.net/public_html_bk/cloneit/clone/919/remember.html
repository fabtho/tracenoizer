<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" She still wants to play with her friend, but I'm worried she'll learn the wrong message about friendship. Am I wrong for letting her play with this child, or should I separate them and risk hurt feelings by the other parents. I remember having a very hard time standing up to a friend about her son's aggressive behavior toward my daughter. But one day, when he was about to hit her, I finally stepped in. You can supervise the play and correct your daughter's friend when she's out of line.">

 As soon as we entered the narrow section the whole field was given a clinic by Team Saturn. Golly gee there goes that red white and blue jersey and no one can even make an effort to get it back until we get out into a wider section of the course. I don't remember how long he stayed out there or when we got him back. In fact the funny thing about these last two Super Cups is that I have not taken in as much information as I usually do. The concentration required to remain a factor in these races has gone up considerably.</td>

 " There's a real dedication to customer service here; it appears that the snobby and stuffy need not apply. Tap water is offered as a viable choice along with bottled; all prices -- even those for the market-price caviar and the daily specials -- are printed on the menu. Even the fact that the specials are printed on a menu insert instead of being reeled off by a server makes things much easier for the customer who might be struggling to remember the details of each. The menu's reflective of the cuisine that made Commander's Palace famous, with a few slight regional tweaks that become obvious when one compares the two menus. The latter was demitasse cups of two Commander's Palace classics -- turtle soup and gumbo -- along with the soup of the day, which was tomato-lime with cilantro sour cream.</td>
