 .For the past week we havent seen each other and he rings, but never when he says he will. I confronted him last night and he said that its hard for him going out with me when his ex rings him and texts him ALL the time saying how much she loves him and would do anything for him. So due to this he is always out on the piss and blamed me for not going to see him, but i dont know when he'll be in or not. I like him alot but dont know how this is going to work out.</td>
