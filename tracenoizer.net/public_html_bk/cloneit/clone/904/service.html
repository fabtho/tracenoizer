Through this program administered in partnership with the social work departments at the University of Alaska Anchorage and the University of Alaska Fairbanks, students in both Anchorage and Fairbanks earn education awards by completing community service hours through their undergraduate and graduate degree social work internships. Working on a reduced part-time basis to complete 432 hours of service work during the school year, Students-In-Service AmeriCorps Members do not receive the same level of support and benefits that come with full-time AmeriCorps Member positions. Nevertheless, they contribute valuable service to their communities and are able to use their AmeriCorps experience to further their education and better prepare themselves for professional human service careers.</td>
