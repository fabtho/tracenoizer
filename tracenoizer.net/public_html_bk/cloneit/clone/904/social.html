 All contents herein are protected copy right works of the Rural Alaska Community Action Program, Inc. . Through this program administered in partnership with the social work departments at the University of Alaska Anchorage and the University of Alaska Fairbanks, students in both Anchorage and Fairbanks earn education awards by completing community service hours through their undergraduate and graduate degree social work internships. Working on a reduced part-time basis to complete 432 hours of service work during the school year, Students-In-Service AmeriCorps Members do not receive the same level of support and benefits that come with full-time AmeriCorps Member positions. Nevertheless, they contribute valuable service to their communities and are able to use their AmeriCorps experience to further their education and better prepare themselves for professional human service careers.</td>

And fifth is a page of links to program guidelines for seventeen specific subject and professional areas, developed in conjunction with related professional organizations. While the document is brief and speaks broadly to instructional issues, parts of it have implications for social studies standards and frameworks. The latter is a lengthy presentation of what the NCSS believes individuals should know and be able to do if they want to receive degrees and certification as social studies teachers of what the organization believes colleges and universities should do to prrepare students to become social studies teachers. This contains 20 content standards, a supplementary handbook, various online lesson plans, and ordering information for the whole document.</td>
