This long-range development plan (LRDP) is comprehensive in nature, addressing a wide range of campus physical development factors and concerns. It is intended to provide guidance for the coherent development of the campus, and flexibility in its interpretation will be required due to ongoing changes and evolving needs of the University campus. The plan maintains and develops the Center as a convenient satellite location to the main University campus, retains a strong research emphasis, revitalizes the teaching function, and is compatible with the City's Northside Area Plan. It provides additional detail and clarity in identifying interim and long-range development directions for a 47-acre central area of campus between Speedway and Second Streets, and Mountain and Campbell Avenues.</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4"<td valign="bottom"> Preparation of the final LRDP and environmental review is anticipated to be completed by December 2001, with the submission of the completed application to the Coastal Commission by March of 2002. . A committee composed of university and City of Santa Cruz representatives has been organized to formulate a master plan for the entire property, a Long Range Development Plan (LRDP) that will eventually be adopted by the Board of Regents and the California Coastal Commission. The committee is charged with the task of helping define programmatic objectives for meeting university academic goals and to establish design parameters and concepts for the physical development of the site. We are pleased to have Katherine Beiers, Mayor of Santa Cruz, on the committee.</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="0"<td valign="center"> Academic Corridors are purely conceptual planning principles to facilitate the physical integration of several of UCSD's largest departments, to bring related departments into proximity, and to provide a consistent basis for locating academic facilities in the future. .
