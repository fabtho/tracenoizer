It concludes that librarians in this sample were first and foremost pragmatists; although relatively new and untried systems were chosen by four of the ten libraries. In the Czech Republic the ALEPH system is being used by the National Library whilst the TINlib system is being used by many other libraries including those visited at Parliament and the University of Economics in Prague. A Czech system was being implemented in the state research library at Kladno that was also visited in Slovenia; these included the National and University Library, Maribor Public Library, Maribor University Library and the Central Technological Library. The Internet is widely used in libraries in both countries.</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="5"><td valign="top"><img HEIGHT="249" WIDTH="366" src="http://www.ecoscope.com/jankin21.gif"></td><td valign="top"> Interactive identity machines are already more powerful than Turing machines, while noninteractive.
