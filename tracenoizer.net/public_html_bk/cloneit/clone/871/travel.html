 Aletschhorn from Jungfraujoch This haute route has many different variations and therefore the tour need not necessarily be as strenuous or difficult as the classic Chamonix to Zermatt Haute Route. The area is dotted with a number of excellent Swiss alpine huts which makes it possible to easily alter a tour if the weather or snow conditions should make this necessary. The presence of these huts also allows us to travel lightly during the day. We will be skiing with light packs so that the climbs will not be too difficult and so that we can enjoy the turns on the downhill runs. Depending upon the conditions and the ability level and desires of the group, it's possible to ascend a number of excellent ski peaks, or these could be bypassed in favor of a more straightforward hut to hut tour.</td>
