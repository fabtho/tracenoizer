Black Box Abstraction Determine the abstract interface to the module, independent of implementation issues. Inherent Implementation Structure Identify the implementation strategies used by every implementation of the module. Implementation Strategy Dilemmas Identify the implementation strategies that vary from implementation to implementation, and when each of these strategies is a good idea. Decision Control Determine how clients can tell the module how to select the correct choice for each Implementation Strategy Dilemma.</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3"><td valign="top"><img height="141" width="350" src="http://www.travlang.com/graphics/TLlogo0411.jpg"></td><td valign="top"> Unless it spawns new threads when it needs them, it would still be possible for ZServer to get blocked if all the threads were blocked. However, my patch is only useful if you _have_ producers that can block. It is usually possible to re-structure your system so that no producers block (typicaly by using a dispatcher instead of a producer). The ready() block feature is really a shortcut way of modifying an existing producer-based design when you realise that the producer can block; ie an alternative way of implementing it that may or may not be better. In my case I wanted to create a cached-ftp-backend filesystem that medusa could serve via ftp or http.</td><tr></table><br>A site I really like: <a href="http://www.autobild.de">http://www.autobild.de</a><br><br></font><font size=-6> <a class="nav" href="">.</a><br><br></font></body></html>
