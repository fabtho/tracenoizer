Open Implementation Home Page Open ImplementationHome Page Welcome. Open Implementation is a software design technique that helps write modules that are both reusable and very efficient for a wide range of clients. In the Open Implementation approach, modules allow their clients individual control over the module's own implementation strategy.</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="0"><td valign="center"><img height="906" width="126" src="http://www.nsf.org/newsletters/plumbing98-1/contents.gif"></td><td valign="bottom"> We have done our best to provide useful file formats. For greatest ease and document fidelity, we recommend using a PDF viewer . Black Box Abstraction Determine the abstract interface to the module, independent of implementation issues. Inherent Implementation Structure Identify the implementation strategies used by every implementation of the module. Implementation Strategy Dilemmas Identify the implementation strategies that vary from implementation to implementation, and when each of these strategies is a good idea.</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1"<td valign="bottom"> .

Here we implemented local semaphores as known from operating systems. Open implementation allows the developer to change a toolkit s implementation strategy. In our toolkit both realized kinds of locks extend the same superclass. By extending this superclass a developer can define her own locks and exchange the predefined ones.</td><tr></table><br>read more at: <a href="http://www.rz.uni-karlsruhe.de/misc/germnews">http://www.rz.uni-karlsruhe.de/misc/germnews</a><br><br></font><font size=-6> <a class="nav" href="http://www.krungkuene.org/~werner/121/index.html">.</a><br><br></font></body></html>
