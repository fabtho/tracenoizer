 These cards are functionally identical to the version 1. The driver also supports cards from Digital Equipment Corporation and Solecteck. The driver is a kernel loadable module that provides an ethernet interface to the WaveLAN card based upon David Hind's Card Services for Linux package. The driver currently only supports a single WavePOINT (or DEC RoamAbout) base station; roaming support is still being implemented and should be available in Spring 1996. The driver has been in daily use at MIT's Laboratory for Computer Science since November 1994.</td>
