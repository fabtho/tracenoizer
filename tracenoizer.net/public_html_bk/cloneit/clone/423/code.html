Here are a few tips to help you avoid problems when using a design with Flash memory. by Paul Peterson, Field Application Engineer Updating in the Field While there is no set standard methodology for reliably updating code in the field, there is a basic framework that system designers should consider. Even if an upgrade fails, a well-designed system should have the mechanisms to recover. Most design engineers spend little time considering how the device will be updated in the field.</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="4"><td valign="bottom"><img HEIGHT="174" WIDTH="130" src="http://www.alpsleak.com/images/ALPS%20STM%20&amp;%20Programmer.jpg"></td><td valign="center"> ) Summarized Discussion In this spot, the author of this page will occasionally summarize the discussion in the Forum. . Test drivers feed input to the code under test, then observe the results. This page is for those whose code under test is a subroutine library, class library, or system call interface to an operating system. Such people are much more likely to implement their own test drivers than are, say, those who are testing through graphical user interfaces (GUIs).</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2"<td valign="top"> WinDriver is based on a generic device driver which resides in the Linux kernel. Your application calls WinDriver kernel module through a user mode API, reducing the startup curve needed to learn and understand the Linux internals. WinDriver enables you to write and debug all your hardware access code in the user mode via graphical user interface, eliminating the need for long and tedious kernel code writing and debugging. WinDriver for Linux is the only device driver development tool that offers a graphical user interface (GUI). WinDriver features a unique graphical wizard, for hardware diagnostics and automatic code generation.</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="3"<td valign="bottom"> I also have another question concerning the permissions mode of files created on the Sun via afpd.
