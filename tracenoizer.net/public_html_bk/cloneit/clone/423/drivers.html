Each design possibility has its own advantages and disadvantages, including those that affect ease of debugging, system robustness, and performance. The alternative to running drivers in kernel mode involves running drivers in user mode. A bug in a user-mode driver affects only the driver which can ease the process of debugging the driver. These advantages are countered by the disadvantage that a user-mode driver requires its own virtual address space and must be its own process."><meta name="Revisit-after" content="1 month"><meta name="Date_modified" content="2001-06-13"><meta name="ROBOTS" content="index,follow"></head><style type="text/css"> 	A.nav:link {TEXT-DECORATION: none}	A.nav:visited {TEXT-DECORATION: none} 	A.nav:visited {TEXT-DECORATION: none}	A.nav:active {TEXT-DECORATION: none}	A.nav:hover {TEXT-DECORATION: none}	</style><body bgcolor="#FFFFF">	<font face="arial" size="3" color="#000000">	<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">	<tr><td><a href="driver.html" class="nav">driver</a></td></tr>	<tr><td><a href="index.html" class="nav">home page</a></td></tr></table>	<br><div align="center"><font size="6">- drivers -<br><br></font></div><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="5"><td valign="top"><img height="300" width="125" src="http://www.matrox.com/mga/support/drivers/files//mga/media/int_banners/g550/enhance.gif"></td><td valign="top"> The NetworkEye is a pocket sized Web server with a Logitech QuickCam for Windows compatible input port. . QuickCam Third-Party Drivers QuickCam Third-Party Drivers Identifying your Quickcam You can identify a Quickcam based on the color, lens type and the type of stand. Otherwise (not a ball, additional mounting, not white or black), it's something completely different.

Test drivers feed input to the code under test, then observe the results. This page is for those whose code under test is a subroutine library, class library, or system call interface to an operating system. Such people are much more likely to implement their own test drivers than are, say, those who are testing through graphical user interfaces (GUIs).</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><td valign="center"> .
