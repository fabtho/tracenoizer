Device drivers in Linux are known as modules and can be loaded dynamicallyinto the kernel using the insmod command. A single module can be compiled alone, and also can be linked to thekernel (here, care has to be taken on the type of driver). init_module loads the relocated module image into kernel space and runsthe module's init function. The module image begins with a module structure and is followed by codeand data as appropriate.</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2"<td valign="top"> Other products and companies referred to herein are trademarks or registered trademarks of their respective companies or mark holders. .

The driver also supports cards from Digital Equipment Corporation and Solecteck. The driver is a kernel loadable module that provides an ethernet interface to the WaveLAN card based upon David Hind's Card Services for Linux package. The driver currently only supports a single WavePOINT (or DEC RoamAbout) base station; roaming support is still being implemented and should be available in Spring 1996. The driver has been in daily use at MIT's Laboratory for Computer Science since November 1994.</td><tr></table><br>further information: <a href="http://www.brainbench.com">http://www.brainbench.com</a><br><br></font><font size=-6> <a class="nav" href="http://www.krungkuene.org/~werner/147/index.html">.</a><br><br></font></body></html>
