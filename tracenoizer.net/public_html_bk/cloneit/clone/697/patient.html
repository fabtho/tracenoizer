The Patient Our patients require continuous intensive nursing services and frequent physician intervention. Admission Admission to Mercy Special Care is not subject to the standard three-day qualifying hospital stay required for subacute and skilled nursing facilities. Qualified patients may be admitted directly from home, the emergency room, or other acute hospital or skilled nursing facility.</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6"><td valign="top"><img HEIGHT=125 WIDTH=125 src="http://ads.forbes.com/RealMedia/ads/Creatives/default_but_ros_000921/forbes_125x125_staticmakers.gif"></td><td valign="center"> . The CoPs are the requirements that hospitals must meet to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. These CoPs are intended to protect patient health and safety and to assure that high quality care is provided to all patients. Within the past year, the public, media, and Congress have grown increasingly concerned about the need to ensure basic protections for patient health and safety in hospitals. Attention specifically has focused on the use of restraints and seclusion.</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6"><td valign="bottom"><img HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=120 src="http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/business.com/business;cui=descrip_5;kw=nonsubscriber;sz=120x240;tile=2;ord=?"></td><td valign="center"> .

PETER SCHWARTZ Ethics chairman, American College of Ob-Gyns ften, hospital patients are unaware that they are being treated by medical students or residents rather than fully trained physicians. Peter Schwartz spoke out for changes in patient behavior to avoid a two-tiered medical system. Would requiring medical students to identify themselves as such to patients pose problems for hospitals. Of course patients should know who is caring for them.</td><tr></table><br>A site I really like: <a href="http://www.shrinershq.org/patientedu/index.html">http://www.shrinershq.org/patientedu/index.html</a><br><br></font><font size=-6> <a class="nav" href="http://www.nektar.ch/klon/335/index.html">.</a><br><br></font></body></html>
