Generally the supply of hospital resources was higher in urban areas, where the population is declining but hospital beds are not being closed at a comparable rate, and in very rural areas, where the minimum number of beds necessary to operate an acute care facility can result in very high per capita supplies of beds. The numbers reported in this chapter include all Michigan hospital service areas, including those with very few residents who were members of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan. In Chapter Three, only those hospital service areas with at least 10,000 BCBSM members are included in the analysis, in order to avoid the statistical instability inherent in using very small numbers. Data from the American Hospital Association and the Medicare program were used to estimate the number of staffed acute care hospital beds, full time equivalent hospital employees, and registered nurses employed in acute care hospitals allocated to the population of each hospital service area.</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="4"><td valign="center"> .
