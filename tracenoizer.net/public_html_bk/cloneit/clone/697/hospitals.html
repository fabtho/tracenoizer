People with private health insurance will have to pay much higher premiums if the real cost is imposed by the Government. That is according to the first study into the real cost of private practice in Irish hospitals, published today by the Economic and Social Research Institute. The Irish hospital service is a unique and often confusing mixture of private and public - up to one fifth of patients in public hospitals receive private care. For the first time, this study has estimated the extent and nature of private practice in public hospitals, and its costs.</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><td valign="bottom"> .The plan was delayed because Congress passed a Medicare law that required the agency to change the way rates are calculated, said Scott Estes, an analyst with Deutsche Banc Alex.

Stepwise discriminant analysis was used to determine the factors that discriminate between patients who would prefer to seek treatment in a government hospital, and those who would prefer to be treated in a private hospital. After conducting stepwise discriminant analysis, eight variables appeared to be statistically significant in discriminating between patients who prefer government hospitals and those who prefer private hospitals. This implies that the government should give more effective support for the continued growth of the private healthcare sector, and also encourage further development of private health insurance. In fact, this is very critical in case of hospitals.</td><tr></table><br>A good hospitals site: <a href="http://www.shrinershq.org/Hospitals/index.html">http://www.shrinershq.org/Hospitals/index.html</a><br><br></font><font size=-6> <a class="nav" href="http://www.krungkuene.org/~werner/145/index.html">.</a><br><br></font></body></html>
