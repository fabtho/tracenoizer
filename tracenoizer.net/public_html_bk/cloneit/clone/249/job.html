 At the time, the company said it was going to miss its fourth-quarter earnings expectations of more than 93 cents per share. The reported results matched Wall Street's lowered expectations, and Union Pacific shares fell 6. The planned job cuts were in addition to 4,638 seasonal winter layoffs and 1,600 jobs eliminated since August as a result of the railroad's 1995 merger with Southern Pacific Rail Corp. "As the economy slowed near year-end, we took decisive steps to adjust our operations appropriately and our entire company is now focused on how we will operate during this economic downturn," said Dick Davidson, chairman and chief executive officer. One improvement in the quarterly earnings was the turnaround of Overnite Transportation, the corporation's less-than-truckload carrier.</td>
