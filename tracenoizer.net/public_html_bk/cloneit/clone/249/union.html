 . His new name, which he didn't dare utter, came from the federal government's witness security program after he squealed about life as a chop-shop operator. In a recent day of sworn testimony about mob control of the Laborers' International Union of North America, Bills described the salad days of the 26th Street Crew, which ruled criminal activity in Bridgeport.

The ruling, which will be stayed pending an appeal by the three men, is the latest in a seven-year, double-barreled crackdown by the union and the U. Justice Department on allegations of mob influence.</td>

's profit before a charge fell 5 percent in the fourth quarter, and the parent of the nation's largest railroad blamed growing signs of an economic downturn and rising fuel costs.
