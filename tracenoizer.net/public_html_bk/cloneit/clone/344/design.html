Our goal is to make every HOK design environmentally sensitive, continually building on our experience and advancing design methods and technology to improve the practice of design as a whole. In so doing, we expect to play a major role in the shaping of the design and construction industry for the good of future generations. We are committed -- through all levels of our organization -- to sustain our environment by designing buildings for our clients; buildings that use material, energy, and water resources efficiently, minimize site impacts and address health issues relating to the indoor environment.</td>

 Within companies, a frequent bottleneck is the lack of coordination between design and marketing teams, says Ms. . Eco-design involves far more than creating a product that is easy to dismantle and recycle at the end of its lifetime, experts say. Successful eco-design also demands commitment from top management, and its principles must be integrated as a strategy from the birth of an idea through the design, manufacturing, marketing and entire life cycle of a product. Tischner, eco-design means developing a product that is ecologically, economically and socially sustainable.</td>
