 . Tenth micron head geometries are already in development. These shrinking head geometries combined with heavy downward pricing pressure make Structural Process Control essential. Structural Process Control for thin-film head manufacturing is realized through three-dimensional metrology of critical features to provide rapid verification that the process is or isn't proceeding optimally. FEI's C3D series of DualBeam tools provide the distinct advantage of offering access to critical structures such as the reader element and ABS at the wafer level, while the devices are still being fabricated.</td>
