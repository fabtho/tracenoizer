 A Pony Named Midnight and The Very Patient Pony, are published by Writers Press, which specializes in inclusion-minded books. Both books take place at an inclusive-based horse camp focusing on mainstreaming children with special needs. I am really excited about the recent publication of my first picture book, Can I Pray With My Eyes Open. This book evolved from unanswered questions in my own childhood. It came out from Hyperion Books for Children in the fall of 1999.</td>

 My claim to the legitimate training and credential of a professional researcher includes a graduate degree in History. A researcher's mandate is to publish original material versus rehashing existing efforts. Measured according to this criteria, O'Laughlin's book clearly meets the standard. The book contains several hundred coats of arms not found elsewhere by this researcher. Many of these were officially sanctioned in the seventeenth century.</td>

 Having attentively read about the offer by Halbert, I concentrated my analytical mind to what the offer promised. I concluded that I'd probably receive a bunch of forms with addresses for genealogy information. This home made "book" was very reminiscent of high school or college notes. This chapter consists of one sentence which gives specific information about Garceaus. Description of a coat of arms, history of different countries and addresses for reference and research.</td>
