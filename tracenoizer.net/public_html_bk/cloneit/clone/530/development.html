 Ironically, this wide variety of choice is one impediment to the significant benefits promised by software reuse. The emergence of the Unified Modeling Language (UML)-created by the joint efforts of leading object technologists Grady Booch, Ivar Jacobson, and James Rumbaugh with contributions from many others in the object community-represents one of the most significant developments in object technology. Included is a brief explanation of UML's history, development, and rationale, as well as discussions on how UML can be integrated into the object-oriented development process. In addition, the authors offer the first look at the emerging Objectory Software Development Process derived from the methodologies of Grady Booch, Ivar Jacobson, and James Rumbaugh. To give you a feel for the UML in action, the book includes a Java programming example that outlines the implementation of a UML-based design.</td>
