 . However, they have a number of special characteristics which distinguish them from most other software systems. Ideally, there exist formal, or at least precise descriptions of the source language and the target language. Frequently, there also exist descriptions of the interfaces to the operating system, to the programming environment, to other compilers and to program libraries. The decomposition of the compilation tasks into subtasks with well-defined interfaces is well un.</td>
