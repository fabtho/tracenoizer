 . You may order it now and we will ship it to you when it arrives. Meggs (Editor) Explore similar items Editorial Reviews Book Description Michel Fries and Thomas Bruggisser voyage through Switzerland in search of a new generation of young Swiss graphic designers. What they find is a Swiss design scene as "hip" as anything in London or Berlin. Influenced by the famous "Swiss School" of the 1950s and 60s, young Swiss designers today still hold concept and structure as functional beliefs, allowing artistic freedom in counterbalance to the service aspects of design.</td>

 . Although I have been home during that time, I have been too worn out to see, let alone type a descent entry that would do the conference justice. I have personally met sooooooo many World famous designers, and even got a few job offers in the United States, as well as countless e-mail addresses. I have met almost all of these people personaly now, and I hope to remain in contact with them for many years to come. As for the Job Offers, they are all for when I have completed my Third and final year of Graphic Design at Victorian University.</td>
