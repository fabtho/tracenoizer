 In 1996 the Vale of Ancholme School in Brigg bestowed upon me the great honour of making me their guitar teacher. I've been there three years now and I have to say it has been one of the more interesting and enjoyable facets of my job. Also in 1996 we started the Brigg Music Club which has been exceptionally successful in a short space of time, attracting loads of different bands from all across the area. We put on gigs once a month in our spiritual home, The Brittania. James Truepenny, December 1997 You can email Foggy at james.</td>

 Much faster than writing assembler (I'm really asking for it here. ) Assistance for valid problems is readily available. Bugs are addressed and solved in short time by CCS It works well with ICEPIC NEGATIVES Often I will find that the required syntax is not exactly as you might read in an ANSI C book. Code is not really transportable across platforms unless you keep well away from the builtin functions. (I use the ICEPIC IDE I have come across a couple of bugs that have cost me a lot of time.</td>
