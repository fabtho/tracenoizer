 This code uses relatively few CPU cycles and should be quite easy to use. Hopefully you won't have to resort to single character command sets unless that's what you really wanted. command set design must be chosen carefully to avoid problems. Some code customization necessary, see the comments in the code for details. Files to Download The Assembly Source The Assembly Source, ZIP Archive.</td>
