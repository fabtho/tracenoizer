I walked out of my final A-Level exam and thought "Well what do I do now. ' Mary and Roy Truepenny (Mum and Dad to me) gave me the idea and backing that some sort of retail facility was possibly within reach. Since then I've had loads of fun with great customers and friends, and I've had the chance to play with some really great people.</td>
