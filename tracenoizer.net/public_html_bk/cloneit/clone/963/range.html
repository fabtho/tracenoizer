 Intended for use by planning agencies, the PLACE3S method was designed to mesh with and enhance standard planning procedures, resource management and economic development strategies. It measures how well each alternative plan meets a desired goal and how an adopted plan meets its goals over time. Using PLACE3S, stakeholders can readily track and measure incremental progress toward long range goals. The site was chosen because of its transit accessibility, redevelopment potential, cultural uses, and active citizen participation. The community expressed an interest in a unique and ethnically diverse neighborhood that promoted education and an environment conducive to businesses and residents.</td>
