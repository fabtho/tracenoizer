 These initiatives are growing in scope and number and are providing increasingly important inputs into the policy-making process, and the outcomes of these important initiatives should be highlighted and made widely available to all interested parties. Sustainable Developments provides a timely, professional, high-quality reporting service for these meetings and disseminates the information extensively via the Internet. Sustainable Developments builds upon the success of the Earth Negotiations Bulletin in increasing the transparency of the international policy-making process by expanding the volume, breadth and quality of information and providing more comprehensive coverage of environment and development negotiations. The style, content and presentation is similar to the Earth Negotiations Bulletin. Summary issues are written and distributed within 48 hours of the conclusion of the meeting and copies are distributed at subsequent sessions of related UN meetings covered by the Earth Negotiations Bulletin.</td>

Studies by the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) indicated that the region would run out of developable land in less than 10 years and that higher density, inward-directed growth was critical in preserving resource lands to sustain economic growth. .</td>
