 The process should scale up or down in response to the funds available each year. . Desired Characteristics of Selection Process for Sustainable Development Indicators (8-April-1996) Desired Characteristics of Selection Process for Sustainable Development Indicators Before actually proceeding with Sustainable Development Indicator (SDI) selection, the SDI Group first determined what kind of process would best suit its needs and circumstances. Individuals, groups, and organizations who wish to participate should know exactly how and when to provide input into the selection process. The SDI Group should take all practical steps to facilitate effective and broad participation.</td>

 Sustainable process development includes the planning and design of production-, assembly- and material flow systems, of manufacturing processes and industrial structures as well as of recycling processes. . Sustainable process development Successful products need innovative processes of production. Sustainable process development leads to manufacturing processes that guarantee a superior cost-effectiveness of the products as well as it meets the requirements of resource protection. Sustainable process development includes the planning and design of production-, assembly- and material flow systems, of manufacturing processes and industrial structures as well as of recycling processes.</td>

 Selection criteria will assure that the SDI Group will choose the best data available that most closely represents the Proposed SDI. . Selection Process for Sustainable Development Indicators (8-April-1996) Selection Process for Sustainable Development Indicators The process for selecting Sustainable Development Indicators (SDI) is as important (or perhaps more important) than the SDI themselves. If people have faith in the selection process, they will believe in the SDI. Fair and open selection with wide participation will produce a comprehensive set of SDI relevant to a broad range of views and philosophies.</td>
