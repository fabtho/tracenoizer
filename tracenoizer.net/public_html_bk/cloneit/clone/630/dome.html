The geodesic dome is able to cover more space without internal supports than any other enclosure. It becomes proportionally lighter and stronger the larger it is. The geodesic dome is a breakthrough in shelter, not only in cost-effectiveness, but in ease of construction.</td>

DESIGN The dome is straight forward to construct but it takes a lot of attention to detail. The design is based on a geodesic composed of pentagons and hexagons.</td>
