 . But as I examined my life and the lives of those around me, I realized how easy it would be to bring a smile to someone's face, and better yet, their heart.

 Tired of reading online forums, bulletin boards, etc because they seem so negative. Wonder why drivers seem to complain so much, yet they do the job anyway. This was a hard article to write because so often the things I love are also the things that I don't love. This is an ongoing article that will be added to as I think of more things. The money is good - particularly when the freight is.</td>
