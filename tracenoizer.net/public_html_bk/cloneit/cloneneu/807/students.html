 The Robert Zemeckis Center for the Digital Arts celebrated its extravagant gala opening with more zest and festivity than the Academy Awards. As George Lucas made his way through studio D, where the private ceremony praising Zemeckis the man and the official opening of the center by Dean of Cinema-Television Elizabeth Daley and Gov. Gray Davis, students who were working the event were taken aback by the grandeur of it all. Ooos and Ahhs followed as Steven Spielberg and Zemeckis himself also entered the room, donning large smiles and flanked by a large group of network reporters and cameramen. Though these great filmmakers and generous alumni deserve all of the praise and idolatry they receive, the message they wished to send at the opening is that students here at 'SC with dreams and aspirations can one day be in their shoes.</td>

 . There are a few reasons that the USC School of Cinema-Television is the best place in the nation to study film. One is the high quality of the education it provides, another is its location in the world's most important film and television center, and yet another is the resources available to its students. Together, these elements make USC the first choice for those who want excellent education and experience in cinema-television. Students here don't just watch movies--they write, direct, produce and critique them.</td>
