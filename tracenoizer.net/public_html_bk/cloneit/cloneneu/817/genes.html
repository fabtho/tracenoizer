 Central Dogma - The Beauty of Mutations The Beauty of Mutations What kinds of errors can occur in DNA. Types of mutations Chromosomal Mutations Mutations can occur at a fairly macroscopic level. Large sections of chromosomes can be altered or shifted, leading to changes in the way the genes on them are expressed. Translocations involve the interchange of large segments of DNA between two different chromosomes. This can change expression of genes if a gene is at the translocation breakpoint or if it finds itself reattached ina way that it is regulated by a new promoter region, which is not tailored to its expression needs.</td>

 .de Two different motifs in the coat protein (CP) of Plum pox virus (PPV) (R3015Q3016, D3059) were mutated by replacing the respective amino acids with others possessing different chemical properties. The mutated CP genes were introduced into an infectious full-length clone of PPV (p35PPV-NAT) to investigate their influence on systemic infection of transgenic wild-type PPV CP-expressing and non-transgenic plants of Nicotiana benthamiana. All mutants failed to establish systemic infections in non-transgenic N. benthamiana plants, but were complemented by intact CP in transgenic plants.</td>

 To overcome these obstacles, Takahashi and his colleagues sought first to identify a wild-type Syrian hamster strain that was genetically distinct from all other Syrian hamsters in captivity. Syrian hamsters in captivity are the offspring of hamsters originally captured in 1929. Once they found a wild-type hamster strain from a second capture made in 1971, they used a genetic subtraction method called genetically directed representational difference analysis to make detailed comparisons of the genes of the two strains of hamsters and offspring that resulted from crosses between the two strains. Such comparisons enabled the researchers to identify specific segments of DNA associated with the tau locus. Using these DNA fragments, the scientists then isolated from collections of hamster genes larger DNA sequences that they compared to mouse and human genes.</td>
