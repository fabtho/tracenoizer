 Bessis MC, and Breton-Gorius J, Blood 19, 635 (1962). . Activity of Chromatin DNA Templates within Intact Cells During Cell Division and Cell Differentiation. The molecular mechanisms mediating such a decline may include changes in the size of mononucleotide pools, changes in RNA and DNA polymerase activity, or changes in DNA template activity (3), but previous studies have not distinguished among these possibilities. We have developed a high-resolution electron microscopic technique for directly analyzing DNA template activity within living cells (4), and now report its application to individual cells undergoing division and differentiation in human bone marrow Bone marrow spicules (5) and peripheral blood cells (6) were isolated under sterile conditions from patients as previously described, and were subjected to the analysis of of active templates of active DNA templates while in the living state (4).</td>

 This can lead to the same problems as translocations. Sometimes large regions fo a chromosome are deleted. Sometimes chromosomes can lose track of where they are supposed to go in cell division . One of the daughter cells will end up with more or less than its share of DNA. The more important problem with chromosomal rearrangements, however, is not that the genes at the breakpoint of rearrangement are damaged.</td>

Useful for visualizing migrating crest and some other cell types. tor70 (Kushner, 1984); notochord to about stage 28. 1 (rabbit); detects post-mitotic cells of retina neurofilament (rabbit); CNS, also detects ciliated epidermis.</td>
