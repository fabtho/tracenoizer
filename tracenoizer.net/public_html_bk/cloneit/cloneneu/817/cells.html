 Bessis MC, and Breton-Gorius J, Blood 19, 635 (1962). . Activity of Chromatin DNA Templates within Intact Cells During Cell Division and Cell Differentiation. The molecular mechanisms mediating such a decline may include changes in the size of mononucleotide pools, changes in RNA and DNA polymerase activity, or changes in DNA template activity (3), but previous studies have not distinguished among these possibilities. We have developed a high-resolution electron microscopic technique for directly analyzing DNA template activity within living cells (4), and now report its application to individual cells undergoing division and differentiation in human bone marrow Bone marrow spicules (5) and peripheral blood cells (6) were isolated under sterile conditions from patients as previously described, and were subjected to the analysis of of active templates of active DNA templates while in the living state (4).</td>

 Sickle cell resistance to malaria The sickle cell allele causes the normally round blood cell to have a sickle shape. The effect of this allele depends on whether a person has one or two copies of the allele. If they have one they have sickle shaped blood cells. In general this is an undesirable mutation because the sickle cells are less efficient than normal cells. In areas where malaria is prevalent it turns out to be favorable because people with sickle shaped blood cells are less likely to get malaria from mosquitoes.</td>

 Enteropathogenic transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), a porcine coronavirus, is able to agglutinate erythrocytes because of sialic acid binding activity. Competitive inhibitors that mask the sialic acid binding activity can be inactivated by sialidase treatment of virions. Here, we show that TGEV virions with efficient hemagglutinating activity were also obtained when cells were treated with sialidase prior to infection. This method was used to analyze TGEV mutants for hemagglutinating activity. Recently, mutants with strongly reduced enteropathogenicity that have point mutations or a deletion of four amino acids within residues 145 to 155 of the S protein have been described.</td>
