I considered using the laptops as remote X terminals, with all the applications running on a single large remote server machine, but decided against it. Especially now that the kiosks are in the 200MHz range instead of the 90MHz range, they're absolutely performant enough to do web browsing and general communications-oriented tasks here in this modern age. I also took a look at the Linux Terminal Server Project, but that didn't do quite what I wanted.">

 Please feel free to use your own words as well as to create your own graphics. It's been our experience that text links work better than graphical links, but if you are to use graphics, then we recommend using non-standard sizes and combine them with text links. IF YOU USE OUR GRAPHICS, THEN YOU MUST DOWNLOAD AND SAVE THE GRAPHICS ONTO YOUR OWN SERVER (no hot-linking). Replace YourAffiliateID with the Affiliate ID we provided you after sign-up. .</td>

 Linux works perfectly as an X terminal and can be used for any kind of application. Ability to run and access DOS based programs and files also make it a better choice. Internet Server Linux is the result of years of work through the Internet and thus in-corporates all the core components for working as a reliable and fully functional Internet Server. Linux can be configured to act as PPP dial-in server for accessing Internet through a Dial-in or as Internet server offering FTP, Web and other Internet services Intranet Applications Linux can be configured to work as local Intranet server with gateway and proxy services enabled. Proxy services can be used to provide Web access to everybody on the LAN through a single connection to the Internet.</td>
