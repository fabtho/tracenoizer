 . Wolpert We address the question "Are some classes of combinatorial optimization problems instrinsically harder than others, without regard to the algorithm one uses, or can difficulty only be assessed relative to particular algorithms. " We provide a measure of the hardness of a particular optimization problem for a particular optimization algorithm. We then present two algorithm-independent quantities that use this measure to provide answers to our question. In the first of these we average hardness over all possible algorithms for the optimization problem at hand.</td>

 . Several of our applications, notably MacNeal-Schwendler finite element analysis, Genome Thereputics neural network training, and GE Medical Systems ODE parameter identification seem to be giving rise to optimization problems that take GlobSol longer than we might expect. This is the only thing that makes this problem non-linear. "Training" means that we should adjust the parameters a so that NN (x(. 249694625700706255D-19 Having so many boxes left is evidence that we are not successful at throwing away boxes where the answer is not.</td>
