 Oh, also, don't ask me for scans because I don't have any more. Old Info Well, I can't do this project thanks to the law, but that doesn't mean I can't refer folks to someone else who is doing it. Check out another Real Book site which actually has several scans. Well, chalk one up to the legal-minded souls out there. Congratulations, guys; you've scored another victory.</td>

 My Liverpool friend plays a song "Pure Blue Day" as the band "Box 13". You can see a rubbish container of city of Liverpool in this cover photo. Here's one more Liverpool based band "The Real People". See this parcel from Lark Lane, Liverpool "Whats On The Outside". After you read all this page, why don't you drop me a line.</td>

 Indeed, some of us have more than one browser on our desktops to deal with this issue, and that quickly gets to be a mess. Can't Netscape, for example, just call the next release after 4. But the real story of Java's success is what you can build inside web servers, something that is never seen by any client and happens mostly under the covers. And the good news is that you don't need the latest and greatest browser, because by the time the server-side Java is finished, all you are going to see is straight old plain-Jane HTML. No muss, no fuss, and it runs on lots of older browsers too.</td>
