 We can leave a legacy to our children that what really counts in our life are other people, not just our own personal achievements. It is indicative of the selfish age we live in that it is. Shall we jettison the message and compromise with the age. Maybe the message will get through and someone will be persuaded that though it is hard at first, these things must be done. Not necessarily a desire to harm anyone or to snub or be unkind.</td>

 To save money, you have to discipline your spending. And the results accumulate over time, not overnight. In a country where minute rice is too slow, this is not a popular message. We want to have our cake and eat it too, and we want results now. Pfen-fen and Wade Cook seminars aren't good for your body or your bank account, but they've been popular because they tell people what they want to hear.</td>
