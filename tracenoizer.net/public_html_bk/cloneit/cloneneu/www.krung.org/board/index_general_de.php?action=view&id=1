this is just to say that you should be careful who you<br>
piss on. you are trespassing into a sector where you<br>
can easily be prosecuted for the personal content of<br>
your website (even if we did not have your threat<br>
letters, which we do). just because you are a nutcase<br>
does not mean you have to be a pain in the ass to<br>
other people and/or drag them into your miserable<br>
little delusion of a depression. besides, it's not<br>
even a good animation.<br>
so, will my asking nicely be sufficient for you to<br>
take that shit off your page or do I have to do it?<br>
greetings, <br>
<br>
a friend in high places<br>
<br>
ps<br>
think very closely, before you take any rash action.<br>
should it be necessary to take this case to a court,<br>
your schooling career could be seriously endangered,<br>
as we will not be able to refrain from informing your<br>
(and my client's, whether you like that or not,<br>
future) school that you are a dangerous freak and that<br>
you should be treadted accordingly.<br>
alles klar?<br>
<br>
