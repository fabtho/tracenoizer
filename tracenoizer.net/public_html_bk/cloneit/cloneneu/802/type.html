 Create a graphic when the font face and style are unusual or unique and not likely to be installed on the user's system. . Until recently the only way to use real typography on the Web was to create the type elements in an image editing program, save them as graphics files, and place them on the Web page, like any other graphic element. This is commonly done for type in titles, headings, buttons, and things other than text. But now that newer browsers handle Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and previous generation browsers accept the font tag, you have some options for type that don't involve bandwidth-filling graphic files.</td>
