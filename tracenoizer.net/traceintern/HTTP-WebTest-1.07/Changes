Revision history for Perl extension HTTP::WebTest.

 1.07  Tue Nov 20 2001

   * HTTP::WebTest now uses Config.pm to find correct shebang string
     for script 'wt'. It should correctly set path to perl interpreter
     even if perl is installed in non-standart place.

   * Added test parameter mail_from which allows to set From: header
     in report e-mails. Thanks Joe Germuska <Joe.Germuska@JGSullivan.com>
     for patch.

 1.06  Sat Aug 11 2001

   * Some files required for local web files testing mode were missing
     in last HTTP-WebTest distributions.

 1.05  Wed Aug  8 2001

   * Installation of http-webtest directory is optional now for Unix
     platforms. It is completely disabled on Win32 platform.

   * Mentioned in docs that this module should work on Win32
     platform. Bug reports from this platform would be appreciated.

   * Do not use environment variable WEBTEST_LIB in 'wt' script. It
     seems to be needed only for debuging purposes and it was a source
     of many Perl warnings if it was not defined.

   * Sample Apache config file bundled with this module now contains
     directives to disable usage of apache access and resource config
     files.

   * HTTP::WebTest now uses File::Temp module for secure creation of
     temporary directories.

   * Removed section 'CHANGES' from HTTP::WebTest POD docs since it
     became too long. Anybody interested in changes should consult
     this file.

 1.04  Mon Jul 16 2001

   * Added PREREQ_PM entry into Makefile.PL. Thanks Britton
     <fsblk@aurora.uaf.edu> for suggesting this.

   * Fixed bug: test parameters accept_cookies and send_cookies did not
     affected transmission and receipt of cookies at all.

 1.03  Wed Jul  4 2001

   * First release by new maintainer.

   * Fixed bug with passing form params with POST requests.

 1.02  Tue Jun 26 2001

   * OWNERSHIP OF HTTP:WebTest HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED FROM Richard
     Anderson <Richard.Anderson@raycosoft.com> TO Ilya Martynov
     <ilya@martynov.org>.  PLEASE DIRECT ALL QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS 
     TO Ilya Martynov.  So long, and thanks for all the fish.

   * Change succeed/fail count so that a successful fetch of a 
     page counts as a successful test.  (An unsuccessful fetch
     still counts as a failed test.)

   * Removed extraneous call to extract_cookies from get_response.

 1.01  Wed Jun 14 2001

   * Modified cookies parameter to allow less than 10 elements.  
     (Thanks to Thomas Ayles <tayles@arsdigita.com> for suggesting
     this.)

   * Fixed bug that caused get_response() to fail to capture all 
     cookies returned by the webserver during redirects.  Added
     subclass HTTP::WebTest::Cookies (a modified HTTP::Cookies
     class).  (Thanks to Ilya Martynov <ilya@martynov.org> for
     this fix.)

   * Modified web server response time measurement to be more 
     accurate.

   * Exported run_web_test method so it can be called directly.

 1.00  Wed Jun 06 2001

   * Added max_rtime and min_rtime parameters to test web server 
     response time.  The perl module Time::HiRes is now a
     prerequisite to install HTTP::WebTest.  (This code was
     a collaborative effort by the author and Michael Blakeley 
     <mike@blakeley.com>.)

   * Added pauth parameter for proxy authorization.  (This code 
     was a collaborative effort by the author and Darren Fulton 
     <Darren.Fulton@team.telstra.com>.)

   * Changed max_bytes and min_bytes paramters from test block 
     parameters to global and/or test block parameters.

   * Made format of output report more robust for max_bytes and 
     min_bytes parameters.

 0.30  Mon Mar 05 2001

   * Fixed ./t/*.t files so that "make test" runs correctly on 
     Solaris.  (Replaced export WEBTEST_LIB= with WEBTEST_LIB= ; 
     export WEBTEST_LIB.)  (Thanks to M. Simon Cavalletto 
     <simonm@evolution.com> for reporting this bug.)

   * Improved clarity of documentation and program output.

 0.20  Mon Feb 26 2001

   * Fixed bug that caused module to abort when a HTTP-Redirect 
     (302) is sent back with a relative URL.  Thanks to Andre 
     Machowiak <ama@ision.net> for this fix.

   * Set Content-type to 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' 
     for POST.  Thanks to Andre Machowiak <ama@ision.net> for
     this fix.

   * Modified Makefile.PL to get path of perl using the which 
     command and create the wt script with this path in the 
     she-bang line (#!).  (Thanks to Britton <fsblk@aurora.uaf.edu>
     for reporting this bug.)

   * Modified "make test" tests to write output to files in the 
     t subdirectory.
