HTTP::WebTest only works on Unix (e.g., Solaris, Linux, AIX, etc.).

To install HTTP::WebTest, do this:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install       

If you want the wt script to use a path for perl other than the path returned
by the Unix command "which perl", do this:

/home/johndoe/bin/perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install       

WARNING: If your system does not have an HTTP connection to the Internet or
your system requires a proxy HTTP server, the "make test" tests will fail.
