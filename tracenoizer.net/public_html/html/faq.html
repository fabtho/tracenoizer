        </b><br>
        <span class="normal">TraceNoizer &#150; Disinformation on Demand calls 
        attention to the issue of electronic surveillance on the Internet and 
        as a service offers a strategy to counter it.<br>
        There is information about most people in the Internet. We call that thedatabody. 
        Often, one cannot delete this information. To protect this data, one has 
        to systematically falsify this information. TracenNoizer does exactly 
        that: it offers the opportunity to clone the databody, disperse the clones 
        throughout the Internet and therefore make relevant Information difficult 
        to pinpoint: Spreading Disinformation as a disguise.</span><br>
        <br>
        <b class="bold" ><span class="normalbold">How do I use TraceNoizer?</span></b><br>
        <span class="normal"> First, enter your first name and your last name 
        into the form on the TraceNoizer Homepage, then click on &quot;Feed&quot;. 
        TraceNoizer searches for information connected to your first name and 
        surname on the Internet, then analyzes it using statistical means. Finally 
        TraceNoizer generates a personal homepage for you. This homepage contains 
        text and pictures connected to your name which are structured in a thematic 
        manner.<br>
        <br>
        If you agree with this page you have the option of automatically uploading 
        it on a webserver offering free webspace(like </span><a href="http://www.geocities.com"><span class="linknormal">yahoo 
        geocities</span></a><span class="normal">). At the same time, the URL 
        of this Homepage will be passed on to search-engine indexing robots. Within 
        a few weeks the clone-page should surface in the result if someone queries 
        a search engine with your name. But this is not enough. So that the search-result 
        really changes more false tacks need to be laid. Therefore TraceNoizer 
        will generate more clone-pages, which all differ minimally. They are loaded 
        automatically on servers offering free webspace, their URLs are passed 
        on to the indexing robots. In this way the databody is continuously being 
        adulterated with thematically related information and disinformation. 
        Because of the close thematical relation between information and disinformation, 
        one cannot distinguish one from the other and the databody is successfully 
        disguised.</span><br>

        <b class="bold" ><span class="normalbold"> How do I control my clone-Pages? 
        Can I delete them?</span> </b><span class="normal"><br>
        You administer your clone-pages through the Clone Control Center. Before 
        uploading your page on a free webserver, you are asked to enter a username 
        and a password as well as an email address. Using the username and password 
        you can log into your personal Clone Control Center at any time. It allows 
        you to view the structural composition of your clone and also provides 
        a link to the clone-page as well as an instrument to delete clones which 
        do not fulfill your expectations. The email address is needed to automatically 
        send you the links to your clone-pages.</span></td>
