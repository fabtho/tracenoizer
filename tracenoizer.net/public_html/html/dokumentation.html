              KR uses the TraceNoizer Clone Engine to clone the databodies of 
              the participants of ART01 one of the largest art fairs in the world 
              taking place annually in basel and then uses them in an installation 
              which is show in basel simulaneously. In this installation, visitors 
              can activate the databodies of several ART Basel -participants, 
              while these data streams in turn trigger acoustic and optical signals, 
              and thus provide a spatial experience</span>.</td>

              The data is the clones generated for KR's anonymous databody muttering. 
              clone data is printed on stickers and dissiminated in basel during 
              the ART01. the same data is also sent in alphabetical order to net 
              critical mailinglists as well as shown on the website to create 
              a viral presence for the anonymous databody installation and for 
              clone-it itself as well as for tracenoizer which is being tested 
              by [plug_in] visitors.</span><br>

              at the Z&uuml;rich University of Art and Design. All teachers of 
              the school were cloned. Allthough these teachers were informed of 
              this none reacted until two to three months later when the search-engines 
              had picked up the clones. From that moment on a general panic spread 
              among the teachers. Emails started piling up in our mailboxes and 
              the head of our department got angry calls from colleagues whose 
              google-result was tainted by clones generated by clone-it software. 
              Because the situation got more and more serious we asked a media 
              law expert to evaluate the case. He came up with the this <a href="memo1.doc">statement</a>. 
              There was also a meeting with the victims of the cloning.</td>

                To accompany the display of tracenoizer in public spaces the clone-visualization 
                was built. This visualizes different flows of data that TraceNoizer 
                processes when making a clone-page. It uses either the clone-it 
                data as a basis of visualization but can also visualize a clone 
                as it is being made by tracenoizer.</p>
