<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" I recently read the revised edition and found that it's even better than before. The constant statements of risks involved, rules and regulations about unions and permits will start to make most people who are fantasizing about making a film outside the studio system will begin to worry about the realistic risks and chances one has to take on this journey. The thing is that there is a very pesimistic point of view throughout the majority of the writing that seems out of place in a text that proclaims itself as a way of guiding a person forward into the world of making movies. I feel that this book is best read in combination with some of the more upbeat how-to books out there, that way you can be uplifted for a while, brought back down to earth, and then enlightened and inspired again by switching back and forth between the two. Reading just this book by itself can possibility break the desire to make art, which most people of our mentality deal with enough as it is.">
