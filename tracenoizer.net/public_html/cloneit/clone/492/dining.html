 Thank you for visiting my page and I hope that you can find it in the future. However, for this price, we expect excellent food and service. The list is not restricted to fine dining and we do appreciate a good bargain. This list has plenty of places to go for a good cheap meal, but we are not going to list fast food restaurants. The line is drawn somewhere between Denny's and Applebee's.</td>

 Integrity is the important ingredient that is all too often missing. Great restaurants are also places for feeding the spirit as well as the body---the architecture, artwork and plants should all contribute to a experiencing a good feeling within your soul. A casual, smoke-free environment, friendly service, and reasonable prices all contribute to a positive dining experience. Serving styles range from salad bars, to Smorgasbords, to elegantly presented gourmet fare. When traveling, this guide will help you find a good natural food restaurant that may not otherwise be widely advertised.</td>
