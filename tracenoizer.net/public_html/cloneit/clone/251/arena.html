 . Louis Rams released quarterback Will Furrer and four others Tuesday, reducing their roster to the National Football League limit of 60 and paring their number of quarterbacks to three. Warner, 28, a former Northern Iowa quarterback who led the Iowa Barnstormers to consecutive Arena League championship games in 1996 and 1997, is among three quarterbacks still with the Rams. The others are likely starter Tony Banks and veteran Steve Bono. Louis also released center David Kempfert, defensive end Corey Sears and linebackers Daryl Bush and Muadianvita Kazadi.</td>

 It was there that Warner met his wife Brenda and began the real journey, the one in which the day-to-day triumphs of life far outshine the accomplishments on the field. Warner laughs at the inevitable question he gets from strangers - Kurt who. His professional world tour - from the Iowa Barnstormers of the Arena Football League to the Amsterdam Admirals of NFL Europe - pales in comparison to his personal pilgrimage. Louis are nothing compared to the daily struggles of Zachary, his 10-year old adopted son. Or the anguish his wife Brenda endured when doctors told her that a tragic accident had left her four-month-old son not only legally blind but with brain damage.</td>
