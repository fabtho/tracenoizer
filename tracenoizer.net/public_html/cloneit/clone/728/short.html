The short name is synthesized by the file system driver for the volume, in such a way that all filenames become unique one another within a given directory. The rule to assign the numeric tail is very simple; it picks the smallest decimal value not yet claimed in the directory. As long as the aliases are used by legacy programs to access files, the actual filename assigned to a file should not be very important.</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><td valign="center"><img HEIGHT=230 WIDTH=296 src="http://www.fordranger.com/29.gif"></td><td valign="center"> Are there any exercises or cures available which will prevent my vision from deteriorating further. Answer As far as laser surgery is concerned, you would be best to consult an optician or optometrist to be assessed for this. Otherwise, I do not know of any exercises which will improve short sightedness or prevent any progression, and there are certainly no cures, other than the new laser surgery. Not all visual problems are progressive, although we do tend to become more short sighted with age. This occurs at varying ages in different people, and may not become a problem until well into middle age.</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="5"<td valign="center"> (c) Find the magnitude of the electrical potential difference between point A and a point infinitely remote from the sphere. .
