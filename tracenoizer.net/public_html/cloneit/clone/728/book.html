 Beazley New Riders, 1999 Reviewed November 8, 1999 Despite the increasingly high profile of the Python programming language, good books on the subject have been frustratingly scarce. The original Internet Programming With Python has been out of print for some time, and O'Reilly's offering has been felt by many to be not quite up to the level of that publisher's other books. So a new book about Python is certain to raise some degree of interest. Happily, the Python Essential Reference by David Beazley is a high quality work which should be well received by Python hackers everywhere. The book weighs in at just over 300 pages, which makes it positively skinny among the current crowd of technical books, which are seemingly sold by the pound.</td>
