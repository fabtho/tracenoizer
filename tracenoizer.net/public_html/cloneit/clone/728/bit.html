The details of this latter are quite dos-extender specific. if its a 16 bit dos extender, you will probably need to allocate a LDT selector, and set its base address and limits appropriately. if its a 32bit extender, there should be some sort of MapPhysToLinear() call that will convert the physical address into a linear address. I'm not an expert on dos extenders, so I can't help on the details.</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="5"><td valign="top"><img height=246 width=300 src="http://www.xbitlabs.com/news//news/images/2001-07/cuv266-d-small.jpg"></td><td valign="top"> I am pretty easy going, though, so anything apart from rude words (because hey, there might be kids watching) and bigotry (because it's just not nice) should be okay. .
