Source code for the Linux on Itanium was released on time by Project Trillian, a collaborative effort between 11 companies, for improvement and bug fixing by the open source development community. Project Trillian programme director Sri Chilkuri of VA Linux said that Linux's immediate availability on Itanium would give the operating system the opportunity to dominate the platform. "The move ensures that Linux keeps development pace with Solaris and Windows operating systems, which are also expected to be available for Itanium at its release. Intel is assisting in all three efforts, maintaining a neutrality between operating systems vying to run on its chip.">

 There is now a textonly mode in your user preferences that you can set to view the page in lynx. Most of the updates in this version are workarounds to get broken versions of lynx to work properly. We will (hopefully) be launching OS Online later this week, with initial coverings of Linux and BSD operating systems. Our site engine is very flexible, allowing us to add sections for other operating systems quickly and easily. If you have a specific OS in mind you'd like to see coverage for, post it to this thread.</td>

 Links to all the major hardware vendors will take you straight to the driver-download page. . Many drivers, such as the keyboard driver, come with the operating system.
