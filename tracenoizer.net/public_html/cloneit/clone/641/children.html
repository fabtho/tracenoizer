 00 to Americans for Divorce Reform 2111 Wilson Blvd. . CALIFORNIA FAMILY RECONCILIATION INITIATIVE CALIFORNIA FAMILY RECONCILIATION INITIATIVE TRUE REFORM FOR CALIFORNIA FAMILY LAW California Inititaive calculated to blunt no fault divorce and return fault standards for families with children The advent of No-fault divorce in 1970 was the death knell to our families here in California. Since 1970 insanity has reigned in family courts and children are the biggest losers of all. Without the backbone of a fault based divorce system Matriarchy and political correction reign supreme over the rights or best interests of children and parents.</td>
