 In the event that our study is noted in a publication of yours, please forward a copy to us. .html HIGH PERFORMANCE FILM RESIN FILLS IMPORTANT NICHE High-performance plastic films have become an important niche market in the much larger plastic film industry. These are specialty products that sell at premium prices because they can do jobs that commodity films cannot do. Their use is driven by the specific applications for which they are aimed, and, although the volumes of high- performance plastic films used are small when compared to those of commodity films, the value of this market is disproportionately high.</td>

 The simple answer is that the unique molecular composition of Saran is like a complex maze-- it is tough for most molecules to get into Saran, and those that do can't find their way out very easily . (If you'd like to find out more about why Saran works so well please contact us-- we have pictures to to illustrate concepts like absorption, diffusion, and permeability. ) Saran delivers cost-effective and dependable oxygen barrier performance for packaging meats and fish, and outstanding moisture barrier performance that keeps crackers, cereal and shelf-stable baked goods fresh and crisp. Most important, Saran delivers this performance where your customers live -- in real world temperature and humidity conditions, not the zero relative humidity environs where ethylene vinyl alcohol (EVOH) is typically tested. .</td>
