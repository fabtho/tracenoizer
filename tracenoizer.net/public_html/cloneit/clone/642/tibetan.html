<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" . Tibet Online is operated by the international Tibet Support Group community, providing information on the plight of Tibet and serving as a virtual community space for the movement. This movement is dedicated to bringing about substantive negotiations without preconditions between the Chinese and Tibetan Governments, so that they can find a solution which will bring an end to the suffering of the Tibetan people, in accordance with the people's right to self-determination. Tibet's ancient and fantastic civilization and ecosystem are faced with extinction due to 50 years of mismanagement and abuse under its colonial ruler, the People's Republic of China. Knowing that this can only be prevented by the empowerment of the Tibetan people, this site is dedicated to His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama, the heart and soul of the Tibetan nation.">

 . China's Constitution and the Law on Ethnic Regional Autonomy stipulate that ethnic minority people have the freedom to use and develop their own spoken and written language, it says. While Tibet adopts a dual-language teaching system using both Chinese and Tibetan languages, Tibetan has always been one of the main subjects in Tibetan schools of all kinds and all levels. Except a few urban schools which are mainly open for Chinese students of Han nationality, most local primary schools use Tibetan language as their teaching language. Currently, local junior middle schools are gradually turning to teaching subjects on natural sciences with Tibetan language.</td>
