 USDLA's mission is to support the development and application of distance learning. . The association's purpose is to promote the development and application of distance learning for education and training. Toward this purpose the United States Distance Learning Association has convened National Policy Forums in 1991, 1997, and 1999 to develop and publish National Policy Recommendations that have been the basis of legislative and administrative proposals in education and telecommunications policy. The association has become the leading source of information and recommendations for government agencies, Congress, industry and those entering into the development of distance learning programs.</td>
