 Because we work the business process design industry all the time, we know the right questions to ask, and we use the power of the Internet. . We turn business process design obstacles into profit keys every day. We provide business process documentation and business process reengineering over the Web, an alternative to traditional business process consulting. We outperform the competition in business process design, and at a much lower delivered cost.</td>

 Our objective is to extend existing control theory to ensure reliable and affordable manufacture of products from new aerospace materials. Major innovations in in-situ remodeling and multivariant nonlinear optimization are emerging. We integrate materials and scope design with process design through memory-driven, feature-based design system. This system provides affordability analysis of alternative materials and processes. Our impetus is to extend the concept of self-directed systems from process control to process design.</td>

 Simulation and modeling products for the Chemical Process Industries. Includes descriptions of PROSIM, a general purpose process simulation package, and TSWEET, a simulation package specializing in gas sweetening and sulfur recovery processes. CAD Centre at Strathclyde University Describes their research on design methods and computer support of the design process for engineering applications. CAPD - Computer-Aided Process Design Consortium The consortium in Computer-Aided Process Design is an industrial body within the Engineering Design Research Center that deals with the development of methodologies and computer tools for process industries. Computer Aided Process Engineering Research Group Describes mathematical modelling of industrial processes (process modelling and simulation) and the use of computers in design and flowsheeting.</td>
