 . John Capitanio, Herek reported that simply having personal contact with a lesbian or gay man does not necessarily affect heterosexuals' feelings about gays and lesbians. Rather, heterosexuals tend to hold favorable attitudes if they know two or more gay people, if those people are close friends or immediate family members, and if there has been open discussion about the friend or relative's sexual orientation. The new study, however, is the first to probe the specific conditions under which contact appears to change attitudes. By directly discussing her or his sexual orientation, Herek suggested, a lesbian or gay man can help a heterosexual loved one to reach a better understanding of homosexuality and what it means to be gay.</td>
