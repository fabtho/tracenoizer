About CIEC The Chemical Industry Education Centre helps to improve partnerships between schools and the chemical industry. The resulting better understanding between teachers and industrialists leads to young people being more highly motivated and consequently learning much more about science and technology. The Centre was founded in 1988 as a joint venture between the Chemical Industries Association and the University of York, and we are housed within the Department of Chemistry at the University and have strong links with the University of York Science Education Group.</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6"><td valign="bottom"><img height="230" width="315" src="http://www.unionist.com/NavSlices/Logo_r2_c7.gif"></td><td valign="center"> .com Advanced Photon Source Argonne National Lab Fermilab The Internet Pilot to Physics (tiptop) National Science Foundation Welcome to the Institute of Physics Physics Resources Chemical Elements.
