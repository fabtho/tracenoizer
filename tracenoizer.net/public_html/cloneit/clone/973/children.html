A separate study in a book published in Britain this week also suggests that boys adjust better after divorce when they live with their fathers rather than their mothers. In the American study, Howard Dubowitz and his team looked at how children viewed their fathers and how their support was linked to how well they were doing. In various ways mothers have unwittingly discouraged men.
