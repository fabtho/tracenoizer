 . In the final chapters, Wylie looks to the future to reflect on what the family may still become. We learn to see in the families we inherit and those we create, the comic and the tragic, the mundane and the extraordinary, the profane and the sacred. And, most of all, we ma6y learn enough about the bonds of affection that draw us together and the obligations that bind us to one another to renew our commitment to what really matters. .</td>

 Family Centered Services, including Family Preservation services, are offered to a family when risk of the permanency and well-being of the family unit first becomes apparent. Their purpose is to provide support and intervention to the family unit before placement of the children becomes imminent. Some families who receive these prevention services are not known to the Department, but are served by community providers. Others have become known to the Department through abuse or neglect reports. After investigation, whether a report is determined to be founded or unfounded, if serious family needs are discovered which may ultimately lead to placement of the children in foster care, intervention is offered.</td>
