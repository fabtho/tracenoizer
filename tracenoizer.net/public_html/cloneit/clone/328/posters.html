<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" The collection is for students, teachers, scholars, and the general viewer to explore the art of the poster and its leading expression in Swiss graphic design. This collection of Swiss graphic design and poster art represents a tradition in transition. Swiss posters of the 1950s and 1960s illustrate the "Swiss School" or the "Swiss Style," relying heavily on composition, typography, and clear communication. This "style" had international influence, and the Swiss poster came to be regarded as a model in graphic design. In the 1970s, however, Swiss graphic design and poster art began to change -- not in quality but in direction and vision.">
