 (You could still pulse the SMPS output like a H bridge but response will be slower) Other then that, u'd have the best of 3 worlds, variable voltage, PWM motor controller and efficient use of batteries. It is trying to create a first order model, to see the major factors involved. Frictional loading will be largely proportional to speed, therefore reduction in speed gives a reduction in frictional loading. A no-load motor will pull a relatively constant current across the RPM range for a small motor. When you get into the performance category, things change.</td>

 I would have included the results in this email message, but I figured that the images would exceed the PIClist line length limit. I've been hearing this solution for a while and I'm sure it would work nicely. Reading a CCD and finding the right spot requires Speed. the standard 4Mhz PIC just ain't going to do it in real time. Could just count how long untill the laser beam shows up on each scan line.</td>
