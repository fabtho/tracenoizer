<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" News News June 11, 2001 We took last Sunday off to go to Tastin' and Racin' and it was great. Yesterday Corky brought the new trailer to Jr's and we put Gordy's boat on it for the final fitting of the walking platform and the tie-down attachments. We are hoping to send the trailer and the hauler to the paint shop with in a couple of weeks. The boat is upside down and we finished the riding surfaces and the first primer coat Saturday night. I hope to go right side up next Saturday or early next week.">

 Bugs are addressed and solved in short time by CCS It works well with ICEPIC NEGATIVES Often I will find that the required syntax is not exactly as you might read in an ANSI C book. Code is not really transportable across platforms unless you keep well away from the builtin functions. (I use the ICEPIC IDE I have come across a couple of bugs that have cost me a lot of time. As new bugs are found and fixed, software can be dowmloaded from the CCS web site. When they're available anywhere in the world we can probably find them.</td>
