 After the show we waited a bit and then went out to talk to people. All those French people are so gentle and nice to us, and they all analyse our music perfectly. After the gig we had something to eat and got back into the bus to drive to our last gig in Nancy. Sunday, 23rd November 1997 Day off, near Paris Not much happened today. We had two rooms in a hotel where we could take showers and then we just relaxed a bit.</td>

 Normal digital pots won't go higher then 5V so a discretes solution is required. I guess rolling your own 8 bit, 256 step resistor array is the only way to go for better precision. The disadvantages are that reversing the motor would still require a H bridge, response time would be slower and you won't be able to drive the motor at very slow speeds. (You could still pulse the SMPS output like a H bridge but response will be slower) Other then that, u'd have the best of 3 worlds, variable voltage, PWM motor controller and efficient use of batteries. It is trying to create a first order model, to see the major factors involved.</td>

 From then until 1968, he was on station WMCA, AM 570, as part of their "Good Guys" team. In 1968, he moved to arch-rival WABC, AM 770, the "All-Americans. All through the 1960s and 1970s, until the age of Don Imus and Howard Stern, Harry was "The Morning Mayor of New York City" and the most popular morning drive-time host. He's around 65 years old, though I'm not sure how precise that is. I'm totally unfamiliar with Harry Harrison the writer.</td>
