This shows the short term effect of auto air pollution and how really dangerous car exhausts are.

 Fender amp, but in the process of saving for new exuipment. I'm a bit of a pacifist so I dont know how I fell into the hardcore scene with all the violence thats been plagueing it lately but I put up with it. I've been in and out of a few bands in the short time I've played but Margin Of Victory is the only one thats lasted. I recently played for a band called Anthesis which broke up on a pretty pathetic note, and a week later George recruited me because Margin Of Victory needed a new guitarist. Outside of playing guitar I like ta go to shows, snowboard, bike, play wallball or anything else that gives me a rush.</td>
