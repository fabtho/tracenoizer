Yet Chapter 6 is thrust upon me, composed of two pages of text and fifteen pages of source code from the CDROM (some of which the author admits to having never used). It has screenshots of most wizard dialogs, and even gratuitous shots of the author's colour preferences and the Windows calculator. While unrelated material receives valuable coverage, other important topics I was anxious to read about are shirked.</td>
