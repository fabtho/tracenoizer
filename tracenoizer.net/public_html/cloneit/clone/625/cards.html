 . Are there any other markings on the card itself to indicate a model number, speed, or type. Can you find out anything about the type of network that these cards came from. What OS are you planning to use with these machines. Win 95 should automatically detect a standard card, and I think Windows for Workgroups 3.</td>

 The most recent readers labelled as "Kartenzwerg" use the same protocol as Chipdrive, and should work with this driver, although they have not been extensively tested. Currently only serial port connected readers are implemented. The driver works with processor cards with direct or inverse convention, and with memory cards that uses the I2C bus protocol, 2 wire protocol or 3 wire protocol. Access to memory cards is provided via the Interindustry Commands described in the MCT v09 part 7 spec . .</td>

 I'm planning to release a new version of the WaveLAN driver in late 1996. The current driver has some problems loading under Card Services 2. These cards are functionally identical to the version 1. The driver also supports cards from Digital Equipment Corporation and Solecteck. The driver is a kernel loadable module that provides an ethernet interface to the WaveLAN card based upon David Hind's Card Services for Linux package.</td>
