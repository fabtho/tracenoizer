 . Cirrus Logic does not manufacture video boards, sound boards, or modems. You must obtain your drivers and support from the manufacturer of your product. If you cannot get assistance from your product manufacturer, Cirrus Logic offers some generic software drivers (the same drivers we send to the manufacturers), which should work with most implementations of our chips. Cirrus Logic does not provide end-user driver support.</td>
