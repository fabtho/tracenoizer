 I might do it provided I have enough time and requested enhancement is not very major undertaking. Right now the driver accepts only raw data which just being sent to the DAC, and only first two bytes of the write request are sent to the driver. So, user space code should provide all the timing and required data conversion. First is that to doing high resulution timing in kernel requires using of udelay which is major CPU hog, and at the time of writing this driver it was implemented as SMP unfriendly function. Second, is that my application is not time sensitive at all, so I didn't bother much with this problem at all.</td>
