 If you don't, that's okay because the 5 wpm test will sound slower to you. . Ham Alone - Passing the Code Test Ham Alone - Passing the Code Test by aa2mz Skip Ed's life story. The truth is that I got my ham-license study books out of a box of discontinued stuff at Radio Shack. New "No-Code" Tech books were due out soon and they were clearing stock to make room for the new stuff.</td>

 I have left the filtering blocks of the dsp module for a later date. I have just figured out that the book I was using is riddled with inconsistencies (examples given don't match equations). I'll have to check my code some other way (most probably compare results with those of matlab), but this will take yet even longer. Anyway the code is practically finished, I just have to convince myself there are no bugs other than those I have already figured out. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Mario J.</td>
