 Martin Hinner has a Linux driver to which allows to mount NT stripe sets. .NTFS for Linux (Alpha) The NTFS driver for Linux NTFS is the file system of the Microsoft Windows NT operating system. Currently, a read only files system driver for Linux is working, as well as a set of user level tools to investigate the contents of an NTFS volume.
