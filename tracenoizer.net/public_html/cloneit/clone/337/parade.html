It's time for hetero sexual men to understand that gay men are their natural allies on the party scene, 'cause they are not targeting girls. Drawbacks beside the bad weather were the lack of quaility drinks available during the parade. Most common were german "sekt", sold by bottle from the trucks for something like 15 DM(warm and sweet), or canned beers which went for 3 to 5 marks for half a liter.
