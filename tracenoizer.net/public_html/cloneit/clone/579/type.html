 . Army Research Office Kansas Technology Enterprise Corporation. The underlying paradigm includes an object-oriented type system with advanced polymorphic features, a suitable temporal logic basis and the associated language, and an execution model. At least an advanced prototyping tool is also planned to be developed in the project. A flight simulator application has been selected in order to evaluate the benefits of the proposed technology.</td>

 We have developed and implemented techniques that double the performance of dynamically-typed object-oriented languages. Our SELF implementation runs twice as fast as the fastest Smalltalk implementation, despite SELF's lack of classes and explicit variables. To compensate for the absence of classes, our system uses implementation-level maps to transparently group objects cloned from the same prototype, providing data type information and eliminating the apparent space overhead for prototype-based systems. simulation can avoid the costs of address translation and protection checks; these machines have the system mode marked in parenthesis.
