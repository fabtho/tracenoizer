 There are several research areas to be explored in collaboration with the Gast and Fuller groups that are related to the conformation of rod-like macromolecules in solution and their rheological behavior as well as their miscibility with coil macromolecules in ionomer blends. The rod polymers as well as the ionomer blends have been synthesized and characterized at Prof. It has been found In previous joint studies that the mechanical properties of ionomer blends are directly related to the Flory exponent of the rod-like blend component of tuned rigidity. As to the collaboration with the Gast group, the aim is to study the molecular structure and dynamics of rigid, semi-rigid and flexible polymer molecules in solution, gels and blends by combining a variety of light and x-ray scattering techniques. In this connection, blends with increasing rod volume fraction or increasing length of the rod molecule will be investigated as well.</td>

 Job title of person to whom your supervisor reports B. Examples of other equivalent job titles to your position, i. Job titles which directly report to you (if applicable) Please attach a copy of an organizational chart of your area or department. EMPLOYEE GENERAL COMMENTS Because no single questionnaire can cover every part of a position, can you think of any other information which would be important in understanding your position. SUPERVISOR COMMENT SECTION This portion of the questionnaire is to be completed by the employee's immediate supervisor.</td>

 1985 A great benefit of using Cold Fusion for Web-database connectivity is that developers can produce or modify Cold Fusion template files with any simple text editor; no special development software is necessary. The similarity of CFML to HTML is also a benefit for developers. On the other hand, one of the limitations of Cold Fusion is that template files cannot pull images from the database directly, although they can pull textual references to image locations. This does not limit what can be output to the Web but does mean that the developer, not the database, must handle the logistics of naming and storing image files. Another potential drawback for performance is that both CFML and the embedded SQL statements are interpreted rather than compiled.</td>
