 The organization of these activity areas within a single unit that reported directly to the President gave great convenience and impetus to efforts to better manage reliability and consistency in the data reported, disseminated and accessible both internal and external to the University. Information Resource Management with data administration a prominent element was linked directly to Planning and Institutional Research within the unit. The organization of the University Planning and Analysis unit resulted in development of both on-line and remote electronic access to data tables and statistics on various university programs. It resulted in annual publication of university facts and statistics to provide a support tool for planning within academic and administrative departments. The university planning and evaluation process has been strengthened by the implementation of a comprehensive five year strategic planning program.</td>

 Consideration of the gaps in Cambridge's coverage was instructive. The Library had bought very little which was under 48 pages in length, thereby missing a number of titles which appeared to be important source material. Was this a serious omission in Cambridge's collection development. Is it only the national library which should collect such pamphlet material. Is it only really of value if collected systematically and in bulk.</td>
