 Gorinevsky This project is concerned with the development of simple tools for the assessment of the performance of industrial CD controllers. Assuming separability of MD and CD variations, and knowledge of the actuator spatial and dynamic responses, the best performance can be calculated and compared with the actual one. A CD control system actuator profile in (a) is exhibiting the "picket fence" instability so familiar to field engineers and machine operators when tuned using the traditional industrial approach. Spatial loop-shaping tuning used in (b) provides a better behaved actuator profile and is guaranteed to be robustly stable. Stewart This work is performed in collaboration with Honeywell-Measurex.</td>
