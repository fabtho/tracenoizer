 SRN strives to extend services and activities giving everyone dignity, support, encouragement, and involvement in the community. As part of an area-wide plan to meet the needs of individuals, SRN programs begin at SIUC and reach out to the larger community. The membership of SRN consists of anyone supportive of the notion that discrimination should not be based on or influenced by a person's sexual orientation, be it towards the same sex, opposite sex or both. The outreach of SRN extends beyond its' membership group. SRN follows the same non-discriminatory policy concerning race, sex, religion, and sexual orientation as adopted by Southern Illinois University at Carbondale in 1990.</td>
