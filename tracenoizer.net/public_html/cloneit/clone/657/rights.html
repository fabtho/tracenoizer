 . For the time being, says Evan Gerstmann, gays and lesbians facing discrimination "can only win by appealing to judicial sympathy and intuitions about fairness rather than by invoking any coherent legal principle. " But, he continues, the struggle for class-based gay and lesbian rights should not be considered an issue unto itself, but should be looked at within the entire field of "equal protection" jurisprudence. In that context, we learn that the courts have been reluctant to expand the boundaries of class-based protection to include any new group in more than two decades. Gerstmann's legal analysis is detailed and informative, and his conclusion--that it may be more profitable in the long run for activists to focus on rights involved rather than on their own identities--is provocative.</td>
