 . The new dates of November 12 -18 will allow the Festival a little breathing room from the planning stages of the mammoth Seattle International Film Festival (May 18 - June 11, 2000) and move WIC away from the heavy activity surrounding the Sundance and Rotterdam Film Festivals. The Women in Cinema Film Festival was established to provide a forum for and celebration of the accomplishments by women filmmakers in contemporary cinema. Remarkable feature films, documentaries and short works will be featured from women directors around the world. For the second year, Women in Cinema will offer audience based awards to filmmakers in the categories of Best Feature Film, Best Documentary and Best Short Film.</td>

 The first point that struck me was that the guy was not a fraud. That is why he went to the extreme of contriving a plot that could not be taken but as a hoax. What a filmmaker could do for him was to rehabilitate him, portray him as a young man who is in love with cinema, with the movie people. At least, the film's main subject is not Cinema itself. As a matter of fact, the film is like a prism of which praising cinema is one of the aspects.</td>
