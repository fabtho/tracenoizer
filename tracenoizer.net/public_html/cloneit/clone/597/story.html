 Levinson makes intelligent, well-crafted movies that resist Hollywood's trend toward simplicity. Sleepers, Levinson's latest film, is another one of those tough sells. The hard-hitting drama tells the story of four friends growing up in New York's Hell's Kitchen in the '60s. A prank gone awry gets them sent to reform school, where they suffer abuse that scars them for life. Part courtroom drama, part critique of America's justice systems, Sleepers does have its commercial selling points.</td>

 An old man and woman argue playfully over who will wash the carpet when suddenly a beautiful young woman, Gabbeh, appears before them. She is the carpet's spirit, and recounts the tale that is woven into the carpet. A story of love, longing, tradition and duty, Gabbeh is a visually stunning and tender work that also examines the role of women in Islamic society. As a young militant opposed to the Shah's regime in Iran, the director was involed in a clash with police and ended up serving five years in prison. Years later, the same policeman he stabbed in the conflict showed up at his door looking for a role.</td>
