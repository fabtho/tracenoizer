 Between the two upper levels of columns were panels decorated with friezes of mythological scenes and scenes of the emperor's conquests. At the far end of the porticoes stood a monumental entrance. Owing to the number of earthquakes over the centuries not much remains of the original architectural and decorative elements. The museum at Aphrodisias The museum on the site was originally opened to house any finds discovered during excavations, but within a very short time it was filled to overflowing with magnificent and valuable statues, statuettes, busts and other valuable works of art that had been unearthed. There were soon far too many artefacts for the museum to house, and many were sent up to the Museum of Archaeology in Istanbul.</td>
