<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" " Reporter Aileen Pincus and Reuters contributed to this report. . EDT (0344 GMT) WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A seemingly harmless genetic mutation can cause one kind of inherited colorectal cancer, researchers reported Monday. The discovery has made possible a blood test for the defect which will be available soon, they said. Researchers at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, who discovered the mutation, said it causes familial colorectal cancer (FCC), which accounts for between 15 percent and 50 percent of all cases of colon cancer.">

The mutation was equally prevalent in men and woman and was an independent risk factor. One unexpected sequella of this mutation is the association with higher levels of plasma factor II activity. Several subsequent smaller studies have validated these findings, but the mutation frequency has varied from 0.</td>

 After publication, the mutation data will be transmitted to Cardiff for inclusion in HGMD. . Upon receipt of mutation data, an acknowledgement will be dispatched to the email address of the sender. This will specify a temporary Accession Number to be quoted in all correspondence with Human Genetics. Data submitted will be checked for novelty, accuracy and uniformity.</td>

 . Twenty people survived the storm and subsequent famine to repopulate the island. One man, however, apparently carried a genetic mutation that causes color blindness. Intermarriage among the survivors' descendents has left about 5 percent of the island's residents with the color blindness disease achromatopsia--all of whom trace their ancestry to this man. The disease also causes sensitivity to light and poor visual acuity.</td>
