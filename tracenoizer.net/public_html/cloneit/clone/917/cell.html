 . This is part of the country's effort to promote the genetic engineering industry. Located in the Tianjin New Technology Industrial Park, the State Stem Cell Genetic Engineering Center is co-sponsored by the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Tianjin's Huayin Company, with an initial investment of 300 million yuan. The center will mainly focus on the collection, research and transplant of stem cells. It aims to become the country's largest stem cell bank and transplant base in three years.</td>
