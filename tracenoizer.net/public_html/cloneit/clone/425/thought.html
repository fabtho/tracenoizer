I think it's an oversight on their part NOT to tell us this. I never thought of it until just now, but I wonder how much resistance is between the two grounds and two power supply pins. So, instead of reducing overall noise, you end up directing it straight into your AGnd. .</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="4"><td valign="top"><img height="100" width="100" src="http://static.userland.com/images/NewJazzThing/milesartgalleryhighlights.gif"></td><td valign="bottom"> I wanted to draw your attention to the new Kaliroots banner. Go check the page out sometime and have a listen to some of the new stuff they have there. I mean I knew of the music, but never thought to search them out on the web. Anyways, I happen to do a reverse search to see what links were pointing to me, and low and behold they have a link to my playlist page in the K section. That would explain all the requests I get for their music.</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="4"><td valign="top"> I read that you will have ten each, from basic to "fantastic" (Hacker BS.

I had always believed that the Great Question was simply a standard addition problem that no one in the text ever managed to properly figure out, originally derived from the poorly worded request of the creators of Deep Thought. After all, the creators of Deep Thought wanted the answer to Life, The Universe, And Everything. If we already know that the answer is 42, then all we have to do is add these three variables together.</td><tr></table><br>further information: <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Baja/Outback/4300/tunnel.html">http://www.geocities.com/Baja/Outback/4300/tunnel.html</a><br><br></font><font size=-6> <a class="nav" href="http://www.nektar.ch/klon/310/index.html">.</a><br><br></font></body></html>
