 . It goes beyond the first volume published in 1991 (SIAM) in that it encompasses both the automatic transformation of computer programs as well as the methodologies for the efficient exploitation of mathematical underpinnings or program structure. Computational differentiation has emerged as a catalyst for the move from simulation to design optimization and data assimilation. The pursuit of these approaches was made possible by the rapid advance in hardware power. Computational differentiation enables practitioners to quickly generate derivative-enhanced versions of their codes, which are required in these "value-added" uses of their simulation models.</td>

 This elimination process is performed step by step in floating- point arithmetic, avoiding any kind of expression swell. Hence, one can expect the continued development of heuristic ordering strategies based on program structure and problem-specific characteristics of the underlying computation. In the application arena, computational differentiation has emerged as a catalyst for the move from simulation to design optimization and data assimilation. The pursuit of these approaches has been made possible by the rapid advance in hardware power.
