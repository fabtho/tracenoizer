 At GMRS Web we hope to evaluate as many radios as we can so that you can make an informed choice and get all the radio you can for the buck. The reference scale below is from 1 to 5, where 1 is the lowest rating for a particular category and 5 is the highest rating. You will notice that we do not discuss OUTPUT POWER or RANGE of FRS radios. Height and antenna efficiency are far more important than output power. There are so many other factors that affect range of operation that the information would be meaningless.</td>

 900 Kansas City Southern -- Deramus Yard, Shreveport This list includes 514 frequencies for 151 railroads. . The frequency assignment within this frequency range is managed by the Association of American Railroads (AAR), which is an industry association composed of the various railroads of the United States and Canada. With the increasing use of run-through trains and leased motive power, many of America's railroads are equipping locomotives with radio transceivers capable of using all 97 railroad frequencies. For simplicity, the frequencies are assigned channel numbers that are used to select the proper frequency on any AAR 97-channel radio.</td>
