The frequency assignment within this frequency range is managed by the Association of American Railroads (AAR), which is an industry association composed of the various railroads of the United States and Canada. With the increasing use of run-through trains and leased motive power, many of America's railroads are equipping locomotives with radio transceivers capable of using all 97 railroad frequencies. For simplicity, the frequencies are assigned channel numbers that are used to select the proper frequency on any AAR 97-channel radio. Since the various railroad operating timetables often refer to the AAR channel numbers, they are included in this list.">

 These leaflets also include a weekly overview of the feature programmes and the frequencies of all foreign language broadcasts to that target aera. . My question was if 'BBC Worldwide' - the monthly magazine of the World Service was the only way to get the frequencies used. The subscription of this magazine costs 24 pounds per year and is - in my eyes - too expensive for those people who only want to find out a useful frequency. The answer was that there are leaflets available free of charge that are published twice a year (the next edition covers the period from October to March).</td>
