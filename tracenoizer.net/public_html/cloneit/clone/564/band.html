The UHF frequencies are simple AM voice and are very easy to copy. These frequencies are used for launch and landing operations, EVA operations, and as an additional voice downlink when other channels are in use for the current ground station has no S-Band capability. The voice channels are digital slope delta modulated and are multiplexed in with the rest of the Orbiter telemetry and is very difficult to copy. Much of the downlink TV is on S-Band also, but is wideband FM and should be easy to copy.">

 Actions Add Frequency Click to go to the Add Frequency page to create a new frequency or modify an existing frequency for this station. Note that this function is only available for applications that have not been submitted. Fields Transmission Frequency (MHz) Assigned transmit frequency or lower frequency for a band in Mhz. Receive Frequency (MHz) Assigned receive frequency or lower frequency for a band in MHz. Record ID Number assigned to each individual frequency record at the time of the original data entry.</td>

 No external antennas or amplifiers will be permitted. To avoid interference with GMRS stations, FRS radios will be required to use only 2. 5 kHz deviation, half the usual narrow-band FM deviation of 5 kHz. Frequency stability is tight as well -- transmitters must not drift more than plus or minus about 500 Hz (. You'll find typical ham radios on UHF up to 1000 Hz off frequency.</td>

 Display raw text a text table an HTML table a snazzy map of the AM FM TV stations in the area. Option Selections Limit the search to stations within kilometers statute miles nautical miles of here, keeping at most of the nearest stations most powerful stations highest stations within the channel or frequency range for stations meeting the above criteria, or the selections and start over. Information about the Station Location Page Documentation for the station location pages is available in both boring old mundane and exciting new zippyfied varieties, explaining How to use this service; What's currently on the to-do list; Where to locate the data sources upon which its operation is based; Where to find other similar or related web resources; How many stations are in each band, tabulated by frequency and service class or country. ..</td>
