 SoundtrackNet talks with composer Hans Zimmer about his live concert last fall, his thoughts on Pearl Harbor, "Iron Chef", and much more. (read article) Article A Look At Film Music Books SoundtrackNet takes a break from CDs and composer interviews for a moment and looks at the printed word. A few books on Film Music have come out in the past year or so, and we've selected a few of them that might be worth taking a look at. ..</td>

 If you want to help choose the films for next term or take part in the running of the society, why not come along to one of our meetings. Even if you live hundreds of miles from Edinburgh and don't want to be a member, you'll probably find our reviews archive of interest. It holds the collected writings of many past and present members and covers a lot of lesser known titles as well as the popular hits. You can also find out more about our society and how it operates. Our mailing list will keep you in touch with society news and events and our links page provides pointers to further film related information.</td>
