 Whether you like blockbusters like X-Men and Gladiator, cult hits such as Memento or Underground, or classics like A Matter of Life and Death and Duck Soup, we're playing the lot. By actively programming films which we want to see, we think we have come up with a programme which beats most cinemas hands-down. If you want to join the society and want to know more please read this page. If you want to help choose the films for next term or take part in the running of the society, why not come along to one of our meetings. Even if you live hundreds of miles from Edinburgh and don't want to be a member, you'll probably find our reviews archive of interest.</td>
