 Rain overnight soaked the course, and it was still raining as Love warmed up and played his first two holes. A strong, swirling breeze shooed away the clouds, but made the course play tough early on. For example, Love hit driver and a 1-iron on the 503-yard opening hole, just short of the green. On Thursday, he reached the par 5 with a 3-wood and a 6-iron. He picked up a stroke on the field with a 3-iron into 4 feet on the 236-yard fourth hole, and briefly pulled away from the field with four birdies on a five-hole stretch starting on the back nine.</td>

 In its initial response to the Debtors' objection to its claim, the IRS maintained that it had an administrative expense claim pursuant to 11 U. Consequently, these post-petition liabilities must be paid in full prior to the confirmation of the debtors' plan. When a debtor elects to partition the tax year under section 1398, the federal income tax liability for the first short taxable year becomes an allowable claim against the bankruptcy estate as a claim arising before the commencement of the case. Accordingly, any tax liability for that year is entitled to priority under section 507(a)(8) and is collectible from the estate to the extent assets are available to pay debts of that priority. -Notwithstanding section 442, the debtor may (without the approval of the Secretary) elect to treat the debtor's taxable year which includes the commencement date as 2 taxable years (i) the first of which ends on the day before the commencement date, and (ii) the second of which begins on the commencement date.</td>
