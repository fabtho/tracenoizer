 They lined the fairways with rough a few years ago and they've redone several greens. But those changes are subtle -- like the course -- and Bobby Jones' vision is always preserved. but it's still where the pin was when Ben (Crenshaw) made the putt that iced the tournament in '95," Davis Love III said. "You can do that if you can remember six years back at the British Open or 10 years back at Pebble Beach, but it doesn't have the year-after-year (context as a Masters does). " Love's chip-in at the 16th hole on Sunday last year was one of those memorable moments.</td>
