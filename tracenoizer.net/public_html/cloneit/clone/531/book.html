Amid all the stories of the deceptions and intelligence games played by the world's secret services, it's tempting to suspect that Thomas is being played as much as any of the other dupes he tells of. The tales Thomas tells are often very critical of the Mossad, yet running through the book is the implication that the Mossad is the only competant intelligence organization on the planet, and that all other intelligence organizations are staffed with bumbling fools. My impression is that Thomas' principle source of information is one or more retired or discharged Mossad officers, possibly high up, who have both a pride in the organization as well as an axe or two to grind. Very probably it's a single source, with background information gathered from various public sources.">

 The end result is a text free of the qualifiers that make political commentary so tedious and sterile, and one that rings with a surprising authenticity. No matter what their ethnic identity, how much and how long they have suffered, almost all of these courageous coming-of-age stories reveal a deep longing for peace. But the fact that these autobiographers agreed to tell their painful stories together, in one book, is an undeniable expression of hope. In listening to each other, these people help us hear all sides. Booklist This disturbing collection begins with childhood memories of the 1948 war and ends with accounts of young Palestinians and Israelis growing up now.</td>
