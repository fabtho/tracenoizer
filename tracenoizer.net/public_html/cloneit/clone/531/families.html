 Rather, it is simply the minimum duty of anyone who asserts judicial or legislative control over them. . But do conservatives really want to be saying that only modern, fortunate, two-parent families should be protected by -- and from -- the government. After all, the same narrow view of families' rights which now lets courts break up lesbians' families may next be used against parents who home-school their kids, take them to church, or teach them to shoot. The latter view is merely a potential threat to families.</td>

 Of course, claiming to be The Gideon Family is an exercise in hubris, if not arrogance. But why should this author disappoint those that have come to expect a certain level of behavior. Granted there are other families of the Gideon name; none are mine. We're experimenting with different formats in which to display ourselves, so this page is subject to drastic changes at odd moments. .</td>
