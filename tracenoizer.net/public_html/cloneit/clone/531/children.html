What makes "Children of Israel, Children of Palestine" so successful is that it puts a human face on life in an historically war-torn area. The voices of men and women ranging from age 14 through 76 paint a dramatic picture of what life has been like in Israel since 1948. Stories of survival and haunting images of death and despair fill the pages of the book from cover to cover.">

 Simons Building 4809 Woodward Avenue Detroit, MI 48201-1309 . . A novel set in late nineteenth-century London, Children of the Ghetto gave an inside look into an immigrant community that was almost as mysterious to the more established middle-class Jews of Britain as to the non-Jewish population, providing a compelling analysis of a generation caught between the ghetto and modern British life. Children of the Ghetto remains a landmark work of modern Jewish fiction as well as an essential late Victorian text. As the first Jewish East End novel, the book ignited an important twentieth-century genre.</td>
