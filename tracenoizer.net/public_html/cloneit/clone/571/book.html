 The father is a "colored" schoolteacher who has become a hero in the struggle against apartheid; his companion is a white activist fiercely dedicated to the cause. As difficult as it is to read (it made me feel kind of stupid. The book tells the story of the effect of apartheid on one black family in South Africa. Will, who is a young man, finds out that his father is having a relationship with a white woman. Throughout the whole book you get to read about Will's feelings about his father and how horrified he is about him having another woman.</td>
