 Swiss Family Robinson is being directed by NWCT Artistic Director John Monteverde. the pirates return for their hostage and challenge the family in a final battle staged by local fight master John Armour. A Swiss pastor, Johann Wyss is credited with writing Swiss Family Robinson and frequently told some of the episodes to his own four sons. The star of any production of Swiss Family Robinson is the treehouse, and here it will be brought gloriously to like by Chris Whitten Design and Display. Swiss Family Robinson is supported in part by grants from the Meyer Memorial Trust, the Regional Arts and Culture Council, the Oregon Arts Commission and the National Endowment for the Arts.</td>
