 . The Swiss Family Robinson, by David Wyss The Robinson family lost at sea -- Vroni and the wondrous island Based on The Swiss Family Robinson by David Wyss Publication anecdote Apparently, the publication history for Robinson is a long one, and entirely posthumous. The story was collected together and published by David Wyss's son, Rudolph Wyss, and published for the first time in 1912. The original author did not publish the book himself. The story was one that David Wyss had orally told to children during his lifetime -- many years later his son decided to put it down onto paper.</td>

 His spleen is nearly normal; it had been very large. . After a year of treatment, Raul could not feel his son's spleen and his liver had also shrunk in size. I think I must have covered it in my first year of medical training but all I remembered when Asaf was first diagnosed was that either the patient died or was asymptomatic (had no symptoms). We were lucky that the GP who saw Asaf recognised Gauchers, especially as I was his boss.</td>
