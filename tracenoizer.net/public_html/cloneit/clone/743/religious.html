 The county has built a great steel wall among the cadres and people of the county against separatists. . ARTICLES The authorities in Lhasa have launched a crackdown on religious activities which is the most severe and wide-ranging in recent years in its impact on the private lives and traditions of Tibetans. School students in Lhasa have been told that they are not allowed to visit monasteries or temples to pray or attend religious ceremonies during the summer holidays, and thangkas (Tibetan religious paintings) have been banned from private homes. Security personnel are carrying out searches of people's homes to look for shrines, pictures of the Dalai Lama and incense-burners.</td>

 The Embassy in Beijing since has actively sought to obtain the Government's agreement to such a visit. . Freedom of Religion The Constitution provides for freedom of religious belief and the freedom not to believe; however, the Government seeks to restrict religious practice to government-sanctioned organizations and registered places of worship and to control the growth and scope of the activity of religious groups. Overall, in the years since the Cultural Revolution, when religion was banned, there has been a loosening of repression and a resurgence in religious activity. There are over 180 million religious adherents with a great variety of beliefs and practices, mostly professing Eastern faiths, but with millions adhering to Christianity as well.</td>

 Beijing sees the Dalai Lama, who heads the exiled Tibetan government in India, as a dangerous force promoting Tibetan independence. . The increased suppression of religious freedom is believed to be a result of concern over the failure of China's policies in Tibet following the escape of the 15-year-old Karmapa Lama to India in December, TIN said. In July, 30 monks were reported to have been expelled from the Jokhang Temple in the Tibetan capital Lhasa, TIN said in a statement sent to Beijing. In June, authorities threatened government workers with dismissal, schoolchildren with expulsion and retired workers with loss of their pensions if they participated in the traditional pilgrimage to sacred sites during the Buddhist festival of Sagadawa, TIN said.</td>
