Driver Knapp, team manager Curry and the ISM Racing team hope to rebound in the backup car and do well in the MCI WorldCom 200 on Sunday at Phoenix International Raceway.

"Larry's basically here to make the cars go fast, and he definitely has the experience to do that," said Knapp, who drove to third place as an Indy 500 newcomer last May.">

 Although Anita is hard at work in the edit suite she still manages to look elegant and sophisticated, not a hair out of place. Hell, we are lucky to get a photo of him at work at all.
