However, as the full-text search engine is a separate component of SQL Server (it uses the Microsoft Search Service) this can be a potential performance problem due to the way full-text search interacts with SQL Server. Full-text search works really well when you are searching a text column and you are interested in all the rows that match your highly selective search criteria. However, full-text search is commonly used with other SQL Server predicates, such as those included in the WHERE clause.</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"<td valign="center"> Indexing large amounts of text uses up server resources, reducing the CPU time and memory that could be used by your users running their SQL Server-based applications. The slider bar has five position, and the default setting is at the third setting. If you want to reduce the impact of this service on your SQL Server, move the slider bar to the left one or two steps. This will proportionally reduce the affect of the service on SQL Server. It will also cause the full-text service to run longer to perform the same task, but now with less impact on the server.</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3"<td valign="center"> Erikson 1995-99 Additional images and accompaning text can be found on the underwater guide to Marine Life of Southern California.
