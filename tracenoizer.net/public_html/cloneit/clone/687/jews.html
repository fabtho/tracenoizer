Until the Soviet bloc fell, the exhibits at Auschwitz downplayed the number of Jewish victims, suggesting that their part of the total was smaller than the 90 percent figure generally accepted today. In the West, many erroneously believed that the camp was created to murder Jews, and that Auschwitz was the primary killing ground for Polish Jews. A former army barracks located near the town of Oswiecim, or Auschwitz in German, the main camp received its first transport of 728 Poles in June 1940. These were political prisoners, usually affiliated with resistance movements.</td><td valign="top"><img height="121" width="180" src="http://www.filmbuero-nds.de/fmb_rb56/rb56_images/fmb_rb56_chpaul_eroffnung_180.jpg"></td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"<td valign="center"> When the Nazis overran the Netherlands the camp was in use by roughly seven hundred and fifty German Jewish refugees. Reserve kapitein (Captain in the Reserves) Jacques Schol of the demobilized Dutch Army Reserves and former leader of another refugee camp called Hellevoetsluis was appointed commander of refugee camp Westerbork on 16 July 1940. Captain Schol introduced new regulations for the German Jews in February 1942. Since the internees for the most part spoke the German language new camp rules were written and introduced in the German language. Schol incorporated all refugees over the age of fourteen into work groups.</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="6"><td valign="center"> Yet still they retain some divine sense and, as will be shown in the next chapter, the glacier becomes an abode for them wherein they can be redeemed from their suffering. . Master's Thesis - Chapter V CHAPTER V THE JEWISH GLACIER Jewish Colors Jewish Stones Jewish Ice CHAPTER V The Jewish Glacier In many of Celan's poems, the suffering of the Jews and his own suffering lies at the heart of his glacial imagery. Jewish destruction and persecution acts as a catharsis for much of his writings. No longer do they stand simply for silence, but they become the means by which he purges himself of his suffering.</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3"><td valign="bottom"><img height="200" width="192" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/7071/monument.jpg"></td><td valign="center"> But Adorno didn't show up and the meeting never took place.
