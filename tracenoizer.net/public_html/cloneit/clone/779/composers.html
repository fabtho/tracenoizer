 I was particularly attracted to those "progressive" groups who tried to combine these disparate musical styles. The music that I write is strongly influenced by this desire to create a satisfactory combination of different styles. Contemporary Australian and American music has also been a tremendous influence; in particular the music of Australian composers Peter Sculthorpe and Ross Edwards, and American composers such as Samuel Barber, Philip Glass and John Adams. In an effort to distance himself from composers like Glass and Steve Reich, John Adams once used the term "continuous music" to describe his musical style. I have always thought that this term was also particularly appropriate when describing my own music.</td>
