 The funny thing is I would have done it for free, but it was an honor to be paid for doing something that I really enjoy. . One of the reasons chose the flute at the time is because he figured it would be the easiest instrument to carry back and forth from home to school. "When I went to high school I quit playing music altogether because I became more interested in playing sports. But even back then, while watching and hearing the marching band play, I always felt that creating music was really special and cool.</td>

 Bach spent the height of his working life in a Lutheran church position in Leipzig, as both organist and music director. Much of his music is overtly religious, while many of his secular works admit religious interpretations on some levels. His large output of organ music is considered to be the greatest legacy of compositions for the instrument, and is the measure by which all later efforts are judged. Bach's large-scale sacred choral music is also unique in its scope and development, the Passions and B Minor Mass having led to the rediscovery of his music in the 19th century. His huge output of cantatas for all occasions is equally impressive.</td>
