If you thought Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito made strange brothers, how about Robert Duvall and James Earl Jones. A Family Thing's premise is that Duvall's character, Earl Pilcher, has been raised as the son of white parents, even though his real mother was black. After the death of the woman he called "Mom", Earl learns about his true heritage, and heads north to Chicago to meet his half-brother, Raymond (Jones). However, Ray is less than pleased to see Earl, because he associates his white sibling with tragedy.</td><td valign="bottom"><img HEIGHT="128" WIDTH="128" src="http://www.ccts-ettc.org/bellmawr/Burke/../images/images.k4/familybaby.gif"></td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="1"<td valign="top"> Buying the somewhat obsolete CPU's (oh yeah, it's a dual procesing board) saved us a bundle.
