 )Don't Be Hard On YourselfIts okay to feel like hurting yourself, the key is to learn how to handle those feelings. Staying safe can be a very hard task, and each day you get through without harming yourself is a great accomplishment. Everyone can slip from time to time but the important thing to do is to work through your feelings and try not to be down on yourself. Try calling some of them and talking about how you feel.

 its for like no reason at all because when i look, everything is fine however im still never happy. I cant work out if its just because im growing up and all that kinda shit or if im messed up. I have the same dream as about 300 million other kids do in the world (to become pro skater) and i cant help but think about what the hell im gunna do if that doesnt work out because tahts the only thing that i really want to do. I can never think clearly about many things me head feels all kind of shady n once again i cant work out if thats caused from too many bongs or just me bein weird. i can never remember anything clearly and i have all these friends but not one who i am really close with and can talk to about this kind of thing, and even when i try and talk about it like now it all comes out in gibberish and doesnt make sense so your probebly having a damn hard time tryin to understand what im saying.</td>
