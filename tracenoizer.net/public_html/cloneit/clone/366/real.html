 While the RT2000 is a two-card product (one card supplies the necessary FireWire ports, the other card drives the monitor connection), the RTMac occupies a single PCI slot and uses the Macintosh's existing FireWire ports. Although it will be offered initially for the G4, Matrox is exploring compatibility with G3-based Power Macs. The RTMac will perform real-time rendering for a subset of FCP's most common effects and transitions. These will include motion effects, crossfades, the standard SMPTE wipes, and alpha gain. The more swirly, organic looking transitions shipping with its PC brother will be missing, although these and other features such as real time MPEG transcoding -- critical for creating DVD content -- can conceivably be delivered with a software update.</td>
