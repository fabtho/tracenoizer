Significant among them is the Coalition for the Advancement of Science and Mathematics Education in Oklahoma (CASMEO), a nonprofit alliance of representatives from business, education, and the private sector. One of the most promising linkages that has been established in the mathematics reform process in Oklahoma involves cooperation among the seven geographically distributed Professional Development Centers (PDCs) funded directly by the state of Oklahoma; each PDC is charged with the continuing education of the educators in the region it serves. Another strong linkage is with the Southwest Educational Development Laboratory (SEDL). The collaboration between CASMEO, PDCs, and SEDL has evolved a model which has contributed to improving mathematics and science education in Oklahoma.</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="2"><td valign="center"><img HEIGHT=236 WIDTH=314 src="http://www.coe.uh.edu/insite/elec_pub/HTML1998/FIGURE2.JPG"></td><td valign="top"> Back to the article Interaction for Computer-Aided Learning Sissel Guttormsen Schaer, S.
