In addition, the number of dual military couples and service members with a civilian-employed spouse is rising. By the end of that fiscal year, the Air Force was able to meet 61 percent of the need through its Child Development Centers, family day care homes, and youth programs. Facility projects and funding are in place to meet 65 percent of this need by 2002, but much more needs to be done to meet the Air Force goal of 80 percent by FY 2005. In order to expand availability of care, the Air Force is licensing spouses who live in base quarters to provide child care and assisting them in acquiring the equipment and supplies they require.</td><tr></table><br>A site I really like: <a href="http://www.depts.drew.edu/health/services.htm">http://www.depts.drew.edu/health/services.htm</a><br><br></font><font size=-6> <a class="nav" href="http://www.krungkuene.org/~werner/16/index.html">.</a><br><br></font></body></html>
