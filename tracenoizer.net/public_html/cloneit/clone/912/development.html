 Anticipating recommendations of the NCIHE Report on accreditation, SEDA has over the past few months been working with the other main higher education organisations and agencies to establish an independent Planning Group on the accreditation of teaching in Higher Education. The Planning Group's work now gains a new impetus in preparing the way for the Institute as an accreditor. In evidence to the National Inquiry, SEDA emphasised the right of students to good teaching and the contribution which well-founded staff development and accreditation make to good teaching. SEDA's regular conferences and extensive publications list will also continue to support staff development for good teaching and learning. SEDA supports the Report's recommendation on the need for major research to support learning and teaching.</td>
