 In so doing, the paper suggests that the private sector can play an important and valuable role in bringing new levels of innovation, as well as significant capital resources, to the education community. It is characterized by speed, technological transformation and mediated human interactions. E-learning will not replace the classroom, but it has the potential to change the purpose and function of the classroom considerably. In addition to examining the opportunities and challenges associated with e-learning, the paper provides examples of new education businesses that are redefining and reshaping the experience of becoming educated. In various ways, these for-profit businesses play a significant role in making e-learning possible for our institutions of learning.</td>
