 Much of the Marx Brothers' humour always came from their bare-faced lack of respect for authority and their subversion of the codes of social behaviour, so what better place to turn them loose than the opera house. What place is more filled with pompous old windbags and prima donnas just begging for the Groucho treatment. Around a skeleton plot involving the brothers' attempts to give a pair of Italian opera singers a big break in America, director Wood and screenwriters Kaufman and Ryskind (whose job was mainly to just contain the anarchy in the vague framework of a story) create a masterpiece of dizzying levels.

 We are thrilled for the students and look forward to watching them develop their careers, having already been recipients of such distinction. " Dan Kleinman, chair of the Film Division in the School of the Arts, said, "We're honored to receive this further recognition of the quality of our students' work. We are very proud of them and of our curriculum based on story. " Alison McDonald's tragicomedy, The Life and Times of Little Jimmy B. , which she wrote and directed, depicts an episode in the childhood of an African-American writer in Depression-era Harlem.</td>

 "A hilarious mixture of Errol Flynn swashbuckler and Monty Python send-up. . The story opens with the fair Buttercup (Robin Wright) falling in love with shy young stable boy Westley (Cary Elwes). He disappears to fight a war and is eventually given up for dead by the heartbroken Buttercup, who then goes on to become unhappily engaged to the evil Prince Humperdinck. Westley returns and abducts his love and the pair embark on a series of wild adventures as they run from Humperdinck and his cohorts.</td>

 Barbarella may not have cryptic symbolism, but it is certainly a lot more fun. Barbarella owes much to the science fiction serials of the 1930s, especially in terms of plot and settings. Tone down the more camp aspects of the story and remove the plush trim, and Buster Crabbe's Flash Gordon would not look out of place on the planet Lytheon (though quite what he would make of the vampire dolls is another matter). Although Barbarella is a burlesque of sorts, it never quite descends to the sort of seaside postcard humour exemplified by the Carry On films. Similarly, it shows the innocence of the times in which it was made.</td>
