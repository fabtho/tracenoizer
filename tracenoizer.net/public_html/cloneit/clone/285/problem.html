Excuse my writing I meant that the Rockwell 56k ISA in question was a winmodem not that all winmodems are rockwell and infact was agreeing with Steve Marins post. The problem with the rockwell winmodem chipset is RPI - Rockwell Protocol Interface, which removes error correction and data compression from the modulation circuitry and passes this onto the host PC processor which is generally faster (per dollar) than the multitude of microprocessors in use in smaller internal cards. Theoretically for some transfers winmodems should be faster as there are less intH sent to the processor which considering the way windows handles interrupt polling might be a good thing. Even then the problem goes deeper as there are two versions of RPI in use.">

 I foun Zach Briwns driver, but there's no ALSA Driver at the moment, so I decided to write one based on the driver from Zach Brown and Alan Cox. Zach Brown is coding a driver for the OSS Lite Project. If you have time, write a short mail to me, if this problem happens to you or not. (people with an AK4540 Codec have to enable a hack in esm. (SPDIF Out doesn't work at the moment) Record Posible in Mono.</td>
