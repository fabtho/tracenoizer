 Previous versions of the driver and RPM format distributions can be found in the file archive. Current status Currently only a command-line configuration tool is available. This means you must exit X-windows and kill gpm before using this tool. Suggested usage is at boot-time, to configure the TouchPad before loading gpm or starting X-windows. The next major release will fix this limitation; future releases will contain an X-windows "control panel" modeled after Synaptics' Windows driver.</td>

 These Linux drivers are compatible with Elo AccuTouch E271-2210, IntelliTouch E281-2310 and IntelliTouch 2500S controllers. Elo TouchSystems is not responsible for the functionality of these drivers. Verify the XFree86 X-Windows manager is operating to your satisfaction. It is also possible to write the full path directly in the Load command in the Module section. This section can be safely placed after the Pointer section.</td>

 At least it was cheap, as you cannot buy it any longer. But if you already have one and want to use it with Linux, here the right driver can be found. Unfortunately, Lexmark decided to design the 2050 as a Windows GDI printer. The protocol is proprietary, so there is not any documentation available. Fortunately, as it is a very simple protocol, it has not been an unsolvable problem to reverse engineer it by printing to a file using the Windows driver.</td>
