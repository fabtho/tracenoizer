 Green Building Services Director Nathan Good, AIA, was one of three authors who wrote a report on Pacific Northwest green building support programs for the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. . On a recent project, we helped a major catalog company make substantial reductions in energy use in their main warehouse through HVAC system and lighting improvements. These improvements also delivered direct and indirect reduction in CO2 emissions. Energy modeling DOE-2 whole building energy analysis is a major Green Building Services capability.</td>
