They used a molecular chimera consisting of sequences of DNA and RNA. By delivering it to isolated liver cells of haemophiliac animals, the scientists succeeded in altering a point mutation in the gene of blood clotting factor IX thus repairing their inherited defect. Steer said in a press conference at the 6th Gene Therapy Symposium at the Max Delbrueck Center for Molecular Medicine (MDC) Berlin-Buch, a national research laboratory in the northeast of Berlin. Single mutations or so-called point mutations within particular genes of the liver are the cause of many of the known inherited liver diseases, among them haemophilia.</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="3"><td valign="center"><img height=230 width=300 src="http://www.vector.org.uk/v172/thealans.jpg"></td><td valign="top"> This site operates from servers in the USA and in France.
