Since it is an edible ("food-grade") component of dairy food products, it is ideally suited for genetic engineering technologies to improve its performance in food fermentations. A special DNA molecule in this organism carries a heat stress protein gene which responds to increased temperature by producing a specific protein. A small part of the heat stress protein gene called the promoter which controls gene activation was isolated and spliced into special molecules designed to carry new DNA in dairy starter cultures. The heat stress protein gene's promoter fragment was successfully used to activate in streptococci and lactococci a new gene that controls the production of a fluorescent protein visible under ultraviolet light.</td><td valign="top"><img height=200 width=140 src="http://chr21.rz-berlin.mpg.de/cover000518m.jpg"></td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="1"<td valign="center"> The process of organismal evolution is largely a consequence of this molecular evolution of proteins. .
