You will have until March 6 to withdraw from this course. Several current topics in chromatin structure and gene regulation will be discussed in depth. Original research papers will be read and the results presented by students. The emphasis will be on the experimental approaches that have given us our present insights, and on the approaches most likely to be useful in the near future.</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="2"<td valign="top"> If for some reason local copies are desired, they are readily downloadable. .org) offers powerful visualization of macromolecular 3D structure with exceptional ease of use.

However, substitution of all conserved cationic residues at the LHR and TSHR cytoplasmic surface did not support this hypothesis for glycoprotein receptors. Adapting the identified N-cap conformation to the LHR structure model assures not only the extension of helix-TM6 into the cytoplasm but has also the consequence, that the backbone conformation for the two residues preceding the Asp564 N-cap-conformation is oriented tightly towards TM3. Subsequently the glycoprotein receptors are sealed between TM6 and TM3 at the intracellular site. Thus the interior core of the receptor is prevented for infiltration of G-protein sequences between TM3 and TM6.</td><td valign="center"><img height=472 width=315 src="http://www.mf.uni-lj.si/acta-apa/acta-apa-00-4/berlin.jpg"></td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="2"<td valign="center"> In this work, we use a medium value of 200 iterations. This number appears to be sufficient in minimization of local conformation in the mutant complexes studied. Our analysis shows that an increase of the number to 300 does not result in substantial change in the minimized structure. The AMBER force field is used in both energy minimization and molecular dynamics. The MMFF94 charges are assigned to the ligand atoms.</td><td valign="center"><img height=301 width=240 src="http://www.vector.org.uk/v172/timo.jpg"></td><tr></table><br>A good structure site: <a href="http://www.ebc.uu.se/ebc/ebc.html">http://www.ebc.uu.se/ebc/ebc.html</a><br><br></font><font size=-6> <a class="nav" href="http://www.nektar.ch/klon/350/index.html">.</a><br><br></font></body></html>
