Using Molecular Biology Techniques In Protein Crystallization The field of molecular biology includes all information learned to date about where, why, and how molecules are produced by living organisms. This may cause previously uncrystallizable proteins to be crystallized for the first time. It has a mass of about 40,000 Da, and contains about 370 amino acid residues.</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="5"><td valign="top"><img height="236" width="150" src="http://www.brinkmann-literatur.de/Berrigan.jpg"></td><td valign="bottom"> Beyond this description, many aspects of the mechanism remain in question. . Using biophysical and molecular biological techniques, we are currently studying mechanisms of active electrogenic ion transport and muscle excitation-contraction coupling. Electrochemical gradients for ions are maintained across biological membranes by specialized active transport proteins, ion pumps. In spite of their central role in cell function, the molecular mechanisms by which these proteins transport ions across biological membranes are not known.</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="5"<td valign="bottom"> Another project is the investigation of cardiac muscle excitation-contraction coupling, the signaling process by which the cardiac action potential triggers muscle contraction. .

They used a molecular chimera consisting of sequences of DNA and RNA. By delivering it to isolated liver cells of haemophiliac animals, the scientists succeeded in altering a point mutation in the gene of blood clotting factor IX thus repairing their inherited defect.
