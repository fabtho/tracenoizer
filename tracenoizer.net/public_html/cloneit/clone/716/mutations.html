Here we present the results of a screening for CNGA3 mutations in patients with RM and other types of cone photoreceptor dystrophies, which enables us to establish a first comprehensive mutation spectrum of the CNGA3 gene. In 6 cases only a single heterozygous mutation could be found. 10 of the mutations were observed recurrently in different families.</td><td valign="bottom"><img height=223 width=300 src="http://www.vector.org.uk/v172/regdesk.jpg"></td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4"><td valign="bottom"><img HEIGHT=133 WIDTH=200 src="http://www.zoologi.uu.se/evbiol/Research/sperm.gif"></td><td valign="bottom"> Please email me with any further information, either sins of omission or commission. .

Invariance, Self-Adaptation and Correlated Mutations in Evolution Strategies (ResearchIndex) A. A conceptual objective behind the self-adaptation of the mutation distribution is to achieve invariance against certain transformations of the search space. In this paper, a priori invariances of a simple evolution strategy and invariances, which can be introduced by selfadaptation, are identified.</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"<td valign="top"> . For each patient the whole coding sequence and all splice sites were studied for aberrations either by the protein truncation test (PTT), temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) of genomic PCR products, or mostly by direct genomic sequencing (DGS) of all individual exons. A total of 301 sequence variants including 278 bona fide pathogenic mutations were identified. As many as 216 of the genuine mutations, among them 179 different ones, can be considered novel when referring to the most recent review in the field (Upadhyaya and Cooper, 1998). Mutation detection efficiencies of the different screening methods were very similar to each other, 47.</td><tr></table><br>A good mutations site: <a href="http://www.mutations.arcenreve.com">http://www.mutations.arcenreve.com</a><br><br></font><font size=-6> <a class="nav" href="http://www.mediamaterial.ch/~klon/480/index.html">.</a><br><br></font></body></html>
