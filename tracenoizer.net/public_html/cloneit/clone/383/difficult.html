In it he describes the meeting between two Jews at night in the mountains. Mattias Caduff's film searches for a personal inroad into this difficult piece of literature by observing himself as a reader. Mattias Caduff was born in Switzerland, in Zurich, in 1962. He studied sculpture at the State Art Academy in Duesseldorf from 1980-1990 and did his postgraduate studies, from 1992-1994, at the Academy of Media Arts Cologne.</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="6"><td valign="center"><img height="257" width="156" src="http://www.filmfestivals.com/berlin_2000/daily/../images/logo_berlinale.gif"></td><td valign="top"> It is night and he is engrossed in a cryptic conversation with another Jew. The film documents an unusual recitation of the text using a mix of documentary and fictional material. In examining Celan's difficult but at times also humorous story, the perspective of the reader stands in the foreground. He has shut himself off in his apartment and proceeds to read the story out loud. He interweaves an extensive collection of pictures, documents and video segments he has compiled about Paul Celan and his story during his numerous travels and in archives.</td><tr></table><br>A good difficult site: <a href="http://www.tagesspiegel.de/">http://www.tagesspiegel.de/</a><br><br></font><font size=-6> <a class="nav" href="http://www.krungkuene.org/~werner/111/index.html">.</a><br><br></font></body></html>
