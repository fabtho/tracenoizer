 This file is a colaboration of the many Johnson names I have found, which I hope I can continually update so that this list can be helpful to other Johnson seekers. For many of these names, I have the original researcher's information and can provide more details if required. Marion Clare's Family Tree (459 KB)My lineage goes back through my father Leonard HORE, his mother Lilian ABBOTT; my mother Irene MURRELL and her mother Annie SUTLING. Denis Clare's Family Tree (11 KB)Denis was born in Dublin, Eire and traces his lines in Co. We are still searching information pre THOMAS CLARE born abt 1829 in Raheenteague, Co.</td>
