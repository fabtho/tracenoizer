 I have personally met sooooooo many World famous designers, and even got a few job offers in the United States, as well as countless e-mail addresses. I have met almost all of these people personaly now, and I hope to remain in contact with them for many years to come. As for the Job Offers, they are all for when I have completed my Third and final year of Graphic Design at Victorian University. ..</td>

 Swiss posters Emil Cardinaux was one of the first Swiss painters to turn his hand to poster art. The latter was made possible by lithographic standards that were the envy of other designers all over the world. The photographic poster and the International Typographic Style The development of the photographic poster around 1940 and the playful whimsicality of the typographic poster in the 1960s are clear indications of the inroads made by graphic design. The typographic austerity typical of styles in the 60s and 70s bore the stamp of designers like Josef Mueller-Brockmann, Armin Hofmann and Ernst Keller and soon established itself as the leading graphic design style of the postmodernist era. Graphic design and the modern poster The dogmatic formality of the International Style began to lose momentum in the 80s and was replaced by the excitingly original work of poster designers like Wolfgang Weingart and the Zurich design team of Rosmarie Tissi and Siegfried Odermatt.</td>
