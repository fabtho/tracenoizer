 . Although I have been home during that time, I have been too worn out to see, let alone type a descent entry that would do the conference justice. I have personally met sooooooo many World famous designers, and even got a few job offers in the United States, as well as countless e-mail addresses. I have met almost all of these people personaly now, and I hope to remain in contact with them for many years to come. As for the Job Offers, they are all for when I have completed my Third and final year of Graphic Design at Victorian University.</td>
