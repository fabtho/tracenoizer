For the 23rd successive year Germany's capital city becomes the scene of the largest gay-lesbian demonstration of diversity and self-confidence in Europe. Over 400 000 participants took part in the Gay Pride Parade last year. On the 23rd June 2001 over half a million people are expected to take part in the colourful parade with around 80 decorated floats which weave their way over eight kilometres through the streets of Berlin.</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="5"<td valign="bottom"> It examines the way discrimination and prejudice disadvantage lesbians and gay men and exclude them from full participation in society, and analyses the strategies used by lesbians and gay men to avoid, cope with or resist discrimination. Methodology The study used a combination of quantitative and qualitative techniques and drew on the findings and methodologies of previous research. asking each person interviewed for the names of other potential participants) and involving lesbian and gay interviewers in distributing and administrating questionnaires are particularly useful examples to other researchers of how to gain access to marginalised groups. The survey information was also supplemented with documentary research, extensive interviews with both individuals and groups of lesbians and gay men and interviews with key personnel within the lesbian and gay social services. While the results of the research may not be statistically representative, they are as inclusive as was possible and represent the experiences of a substantial number of people who are marginalised and excluded from Irish society because of their sexual orientation.</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="0"<td valign="bottom"> The museum's work also offers a unique insight into the rich and turbulent history of gay life in Berlin. .
