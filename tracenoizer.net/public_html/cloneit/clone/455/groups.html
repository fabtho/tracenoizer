"Such a monument would be a lasting symbol against intolerance, hostility and exclusion aimed at gays and lesbians," the federation said in a statement. As well as gays, groups representing Gypsies, or Roma, murdered by the Nazis are also pressing for a monument in central Berlin -- seeking equal prominence with the planned memorial for the six million Jewish victims of the Holocaust. A site the size of two soccer pitches near the Brandenburg Gate has been dedicated to the Jewish memorial. " The Nazi regime criminalised homosexuality among men -- although lesbians were not generally targeted by the Nazis -- and few of the 15,000 gay men forced into concentration camps survived, the federation said.</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"<td valign="bottom"> With the CSD parade this year the gays and lesbians will make their political standpoint even more evident than ever before. Many of Berlin's gay and lesbian organisations came up with the motto for this years - " Berlin stands up against the "right". and as such display their opposition to the stream of right wing extremists, who not only oppose people without German origin living here but also minority groups such as gays and lesbians. Follow the invitation on the 23rd June from Berlin's Queer Community and take part in the most important even to take place this year in Berlin. We look forward to seeing you at this years CSD in Berlin.</td><td valign="bottom"><img HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320 src="http://www.longyangclub.org/berlin/viet32k.jpg"></td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4"<td valign="top"> . "Such a monument would be a lasting symbol against intolerance, hostility and exclusion aimed at gays and lesbians," activists for the Lesbian and Gay Federation in Germany said in a statement launching the initiative. While a city spokeswoman said officials in principle agreed such a monument was needed, Berlin Mayor Eberhard Diepgen has opposed creating a so-called "Memorial Mile" in the new capital commemorating various groups persecuted by the Nazis. Besides gays, groups representing Gypsies, or Roma, murdered by the Nazis are also pressing for a monument in the center of Berlin - seeking equal prominence with a planned memorial for the 6 million Jewish victims of the Holocaust. A plot the size of two football fields near the Brandenburg Gate was dedicated in January 2000 for the planned Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe, but work has been delayed by discussions over plans for an information center at the site.</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2"<td valign="top"> In some case, multinational corporations are in stronger negotiating position than their host countries.
