 I've decided to leave my links up as well, especially since they include programs outside the US, and since I keep learning about new sites. (My listing now includes more than 600 links; I last updated it on July 13, 2001). Also of interest may be Smith College's Links to Graduate Programs in Women's Studies, the U. of Illinois' Searchable Database of Women's Studies Programs, and John Younger's Programs in Gender and Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Studies at Universities in the USA and Canada. programs combining women's and gender studies with the core courses in traditional disciplines Amherst College (MA) - Department of Women's and Gender Studies Antioch College (OH) - Women's Studies concentration M.</td>
