 Once again, memories come back to me of the Stills families of the past. Once upon a time in the cold winter, Jim Stills, Telie's grandfather - who was not at all like the eagles to stay in one place and add to it, he moved all the time - decided to go to Oklahoma and wanted to go right now. Daddy got the old ton-and-a-half truck fixed up to haul their belongings, with the children all bundled up to make the trip, and away they went. There wasn't a nice heater in the truck, front or back. They made it out there and something was not pleasing to Jim.</td>
