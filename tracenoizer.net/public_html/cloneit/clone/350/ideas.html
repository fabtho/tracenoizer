 Newcomers enter this flux, become part of the life of the city, and make connections with others. The city, as a space, contains possibilities through the dynamic relationships between people, which may provoke an active engagement. Strangers become friends, ideas become practice, models are being transformed into action. They welcome advice, ideas and the enthusiastic support of others. The events will be partly informal and casual, and will focus on exchanging ideas, initiating new projects and networks.</td>

 The hypermodern minimizes the familiar, the known, the recognizable; it suspends identity, relations and history. A continuum of minimalist masks in the face of catastrophe; conjuring up transformative metaphors for the everyday. They welcome advice, ideas and the enthusiastic support of others. The events will be partly informal and casual, and will focus on exchanging ideas, initiating new projects and networks. Priority will be given to proposals that could become projects that will be shared among the participants, to a practice that can make resources and ideas available for common use.</td>

 Altogether the site includes almost 600 documents and nearly 100 images accessible within individual projects and via a search engine. Viewers of the site are encouraged to participate in that interpretive process. We currently have twenty comprehensive lesson plans with over a hundred lesson ideas mounted in the Teacher's Corner. We continually add more lesson ideas to this section. Please send us your successful assignments so that we can share them with other visitors to the website.</td>

 Instead of creating the usual two or three designs for presentation we will literally create dozens. We have found that if we can let our creativity flow and not worry about which two or three designs to show, the results are much more innovative. The client gets a much broader selection of choices and almost always finds numerous ideas worth pursuing. And all of the logos we design become the property of our clients upon final payment. .</td>
