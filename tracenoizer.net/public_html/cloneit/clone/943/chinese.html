 Still, I believe the people of Tibet have the right to be free. .com (Parca_Claus) The Chinese have ironically been taking better care of the environment than the natural Tibetans (buddhism and all, these guys have pretty much destroyed their forests on their own). Oh yeah, they've also provided more medicine, roads, and a slight bit more of modern technology. Still, I believe the people of Tibet have the right to be free.</td>

 Our struggle must remain non-violent and free of hatred. " -- Dalai Lama, Tibetan leader AS LEADER of the Tibetan people His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, leads a life of exile in India. After an uprising against Chinese rule 42 years ago, the Dalai Lama fled, followed by thousands of Tibetans. Over the decades the 66-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner and advocate of non-violence has continued to seek "genuine autonomy" for his homeland, a land that China considers to be an integral part of its territory. The Chinese believe communism liberated the Tibetans from a feudal theocracy led by the Dalai Lamas and that Tibet has developed considerably under their rule.</td>
