 . "Just because it is legible doesn't mean it communicates; it could be communicating the wrong thing. " --Designer, David Carson In today's digital world, a writer has many options for book design. Software makes it easy for self publishing or small press publisher to do book design -- to type it in, make page numbers, and stylize fonts. Unfortunately, those quick and easy book design options could ruin a writer's dream of producing a marketable, commercial book.</td>

 .Robin Williams has an easily readable style and manages to communicate sometimes complex and sophisticated concepts simply and directly. She rightly assumes that, though most people can recognise bad design when they see it, they don't know why it's bad and are therefore powerless to fix the same problems in their own work. The bulk of the book is given over to explaining how, by sticking to four basic design principles--contrast, repetition, alignment and proximity--you can eliminate design gremlins from your work. In searching for a memorable and appropriate acronym for this principled approach, Williams admits she was only semi-successful.</td>
