 Use this when reading those annual forecasts that everyone sells at the beginning of the year. You can also read your Sun Sign, the day you were born, but this gives you more precise information. In this year's book, I have written a short forecast that discusses some of the possibilities and changes that may occur for each of you. With the added information about your rising sign, or ascendant, you can also read the blurb for that sign, too. .</td>
