Hell, after Amanda's treatment of me - and those girls talking in the hall, I knew that girls were capable of more evil than guys ever could.

 The United States Sports Acrobatics Federation (changed from USSAF to USSA this season) was founded in 1975 and is a member of IFSA, USA Gymnastics, and the US Olympic Committee. " Sometimes called Acrogymnastics, or just plain Acro, it's basically the BEST and most exciting form of gymnastics. Boys and girls, ages 5 and up are eligible to compete in acro. (that is only level 1 and elite, I think the lower levels only must do 2 passes). The tumble track is made up of fiberglass rods, snow skis, springs, or a foam block floor.</td>

 E-mail Intersectional competition in high school sports is nothing new, perhaps, but the Nike Tournament of Championsin Santa Barbara, Calif. As early as the 1920's, highly regarded teams in football or basketball might hop a train and travel great distances to play games billed as "national championship" showdowns. Never before, though, has there been an event quite so ambitious as the Santa Barbara tournament, a sprawling girls basketball tournament which gets under way at various sites today. The tournament's 16-team "national championship" division comes as close to earning that label as any prep sports endeavor in history. And, one of the teams vying for the grand prize is a talented South Sioux City squad ranked ninth in the country by USA Today.</td>
