I still feel like shit, but it helps to sit up for a little while, and I'm sipping water. I don't think I could handle orange juice right now, and the diet Sprite only made things worse. And I need distraction; I am miserable but bored, and the only thing my mind has to occupy itself with is how cold the fucking room is and what level of puke-feeling I'm having at that moment. I tried to sleep sitting up, but that was just uneasy.">

 (6) If you were to become famous, would you drop your last name (like Madonna, Cher, Roseanne). DEEP THEOLOGICAL QUESTIONS (7) Do you believe in the traditional view of Heaven and Hell. I always wondered in hebrew school how the Bible could account for things like dinosaurs and evolution and cave painting, etc. And when I asked, I got flustered responses like, "Um.

"I need to know where things are in case of an emergency. Amanda's dad had paid for her ticket and hotel room, so she could 'support' the three boys.
