While there is no question that there is a great deal of pressure on PDs to push their cases thru and "grease their client's slide into the prison system" the bulk of these young attorneys do their best for their clients.

I really didn't believe that she had her child at such a young age and what happened to him when he got hit my a car. I especially liked the fact that when Maya went to Ghana, she wanted to represent African Americans in the best way that she could. She let people know when they were wrong or out of place. As someone who grew up in Ghana I found Ms Angelou's vivid description of the people and the scenes of Ghana astonishingly accurate.</td><td valign="bottom"><img HEIGHT=129 WIDTH=157 src="http://www.yucca.net/jglocke/rose-award3.gif"></td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="1"<td valign="bottom"> I was born in the Heart of Kansas, not a real thrilling place to live, but it really is not as bad (flat) as everyone seems to think. My Grandma Gideon gave me this bug called "Genealogy" years ago, but it was not until 8 years ago that I decided to get back into searching the dead and elusive. At that time I was working in Topeka, and my research time was quite limited----not to mention the fact that I had a baby to care for. Time passed, and I decided to work out of my home and that is when this "bug" really started crawling. I would get my work done, and then off to the library I would go with a child in tow-----then came another to tote.</td><td valign="center"><img height="162" width="600" src="http://www.netrealestate.net/images/Net.gif"></td><tr></table><br>A good fact site: <a href="http://www.NetStoreUSA.com/books/welcome.shtml">http://www.NetStoreUSA.com/books/welcome.shtml</a><br><br></font><font size=-6> <a class="nav" href="http://www.krungkuene.org/~werner/15/index.html">.</a><br><br></font></body></html>
