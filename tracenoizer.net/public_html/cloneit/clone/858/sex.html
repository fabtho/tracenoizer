 Queen Victoria made homosexuality between men illegal, but made no laws against lesbian activity, because she did not believe that it existed. This attitude persists today in some (usually smaller) communities. A woman is seldom suspected of being a lesbian unless she performs some action that brings her sex life under scrutiny such as speaking out for gay rights, fitting a specific stereotype, or by being a strong or political unmarried woman with no obvious heterosexual attachments. This invisiblity does confer some freedom upon lesbian women by allowing them to show affection for each other in public, for instance, or by being able to live together without suspicion. However, it also means that there are few outlets for the lesbian in our social culture.</td>
