 Democracy appears to be taking hold in some form, even if just a dangling thread. Dan is finally free at age 29 and now wants to study Chinese history at an American college. Dan said recently that political activism is not his main priority. He simply wants the freedom to pursue his studies, as he did when the Tiananmen Square incident erupted. Although Dan does not plan to have a major activist role, his exile inevitably offers new hope to democracy efforts in China.</td>

 The Dalai Lama has lived in exile in India since 1959, when he fled Tibet after the failed uprising against the Chinese invasion. Since that time he has devoted himself to the plight of his people and to promoting world peace, winning the respect and affection of world leaders and millions of people throughout the world. His policy of non-violence offers a solution to the most difficult political, environmental and personal problems of our time. He has instead advocated peaceful solutions based upon tolerance and mutual respect in order to preserve the historical and cultural heritage of his people. In India he has established a democratic government-in-exile and set up a variety of schools and institutions to preserve the culture and religion of Tibet and to care for the 100,000 Tibetans who followed him across the Himalayas into exile.</td>

 Chinese Poet-in-Exile Bei Dao to Read FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Photo illustration and related sites listed below. Bei Dao, a prominent Chinese poet currently in exile from his homeland, has been honored for his literary craft and his work for human rights, and he has been mentioned frequently as a candidate for the Nobel Prize in Literature. Bei Dao addresses numerous themes in his poetry, ranging from the political writings of societal change to the workings of the human heart. In 1978, Bei Dao and Mang Ke founded the underground literary magazine Jintian (Today), but Jintian ceased publication under the order of the police. In 1989, Bei Dao organized and circulated an open letter asking for the release of political prisoners.</td>
