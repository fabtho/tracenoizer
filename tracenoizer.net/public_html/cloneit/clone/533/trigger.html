<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" We hope that BAN and other international grassroots will continue to work with TEAN and environmental groups in Taiwan to educate the citizenry and to pressure the government toward policy reform, even long after Formosa Plastic has taken action to properly dispose of its mercury waste. We hope that your campaign is a part of a long-term game plan to work with Taiwanese groups. TEAN believes that this campaign could become an important trigger to major environmental policy reform in Taiwan. Continued pressure from abroad is what it will take to force Formosa Plastic to shape up and to prevent the Taiwanese government from dismissing this incident as a one-time accident. As of right now, neither the Taiwanese government nor media have paid much attention to Taiwanese victims' appeal for justice.">

 DCs are recognized as the most powerful APCs and are known to play a central role in directing immune responses against a variety of antigens. Brockaus (Roche, Basel), we identified the mannose receptor as a key mechanism for increasing the capture and presentation of mannosylated and fucosylated antigens by DCs. We therefore focused our attention on the stimuli which can trigger DC maturation. Furthermore, it also triggers the production of high amounts of IL-12, a cytokine instrumental in the generation of cytotoxic responses and Th1 polarization. The maturation process of a DC also results in a striking upregulation in the expression of MHC-class II, class I, and costimulatory molecules.</td>
