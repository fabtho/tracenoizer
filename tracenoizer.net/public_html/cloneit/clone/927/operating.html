 Would like to have barrel parkerized by someone who knows how a Johnson barrel should look. . I have tried to remove the operating handle by pulling bolt back about two inches and pulling spindle as per instructions. Barrel has light "JA", serial number and inspection mark but parkerizing has been removed by a previous owner and barrel is in the "white". Need some help on removing the op handle and need to buy a recoil stop screw.</td>

 . My oldest brother, Tim, gave this computer to my other brother, Sam. It has both Windows 95 and Linux operating systems on it. Linux no longer boots properly and Sam and his wife never use it any how and asked if there is a way to get rid of it so they'd have more memory. I told them that I'd have to reformat the whole hard drive and re-install windows for them.</td>

 MLUG HUMOR If you want to see a new joke press reload on you browser. . Linux is different from other operating systems in how it separates user space(places were you can write data, save files to, and configure to your preferances) from system space ( places were files important to proper computer fuctioning reside). This makes linux very robust and less vulnerable to virus and arbitrary code execution attacks on the system. The multi user architecture keeps your data safe from the eyes of other users who might have access to the machine.</td>
