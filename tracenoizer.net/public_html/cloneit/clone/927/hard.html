 This is why it is described here what must be exactly copied onto HD. When the source is finally chosen, the installation goes exactly like from the CD. Since not everything fits at the same time on the hard disk, at first, you should leave out the packets in which you are not interested. Additionally the subdirectories slack and a1 - a4, as well as images must be available. When you do not know exactly which kernel you need, copy all of them for security reasons into the corresponding directory.</td>

 Also would like to make request too, Is there anyway you can put the rest of the other Church Books here as an update to be added later, especially the Music and the Spoken Word Series, and also any other books not on here. I was able to see this little book help my daughter immensely as she goes through an extremely painful growing experience in her life. We were able to later obtain a hard copy for her which she will use in the coming months. Lutzow from California Functional improvements make for easier use. Much, much improved over previous programs but miss some of the features of the other programs.</td>
