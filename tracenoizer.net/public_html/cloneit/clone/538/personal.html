 It will then come to Art Sophia (03-5460-8511) in Tennouzu, Tokyo on July 5th and 6th at 7. 30pm, Saturday 7th at 2pm and 6pm, Sunday 8th at 1pm and 5. The spirit of decadence flourishes while Nazism rises all around and the lovers face their own personal tribulations. The full stage extravaganza (certainly more raunchy than would have been allowed in 1966 when it first opened) will come to Tokyo and run until Sunday July 1st at Akasaka ACT Theatre. .</td>

 A light-hearted but also serious film essay about misunderstandings between Japanese and Westerners and vice versa. A film that consciously wants to avoid being a documentary, but also remains a good way away from the docu. A personal narrative about postwar Japan, that despite its mild satire is also a declaration of love for this special country, met with its special culture and its special people. With visible pleasure, many curious details and amazing situations are included in the film without veering away from the specific tone of the film. Through fairy-tales, anecdotes, true stories and witnesses, the film continues to circle round the occasionally very different approaches of East and West.</td>
