Serious deliberation is given by the board to any exceptions or to any modification of the policies, principles, or guidelines. The Design Review Board reviews projects from the perspective of the larger context in which the project is located rather than in terms of program and user needs.

The Green Design Initiative at Carnegie Mellon University Carnegie Mellon University began a campus-wide Green Design Initiative in 1992 to promote environmentally conscious engineering, product and process design, manufacturing, and architecture. The initiative involves forming partnerships with industrial corporations, foundations, and government agencies to develop joint research and education programs which improve environmental quality while encouraging sustainable economic development. If you are interested in joining the Green Design Initiative as a student, please see our education page.</td><tr></table><br>further information: <a href="http://www.sigda.org/Programs/Ubooth/Ubooth2001/">http://www.sigda.org/Programs/Ubooth/Ubooth2001/</a><br><br></font><font size=-6> <a class="nav" href="http://www.nektar.ch/klon/199/index.html">.</a><br><br></font></body></html>
