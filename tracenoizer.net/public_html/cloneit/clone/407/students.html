To date, however, there have been few opportunities to critically assess the importance, acceptability and suitability of these new techniques to physics education. Our study evaluated an interactive tutorial, developed at the Australian National University, covering the photoelectric effect and related material targeted at first and second year students. Pre- and post-test questionnaires using scaled and open answers, observations by teaching staff and informal discussions, were conducted with 35 students in the Department of Physics and Theoretical Physics. Results from an independent survey of the course were also obtained.</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4"<td valign="top"> NBCC Miramichi - Multimedia Learning Technology Learning Technologies Programs Multimedia Learning Technology Program Description The use of multimedia features is now the standard in the development of a wide range of software products, from information kiosks to complex training simulators. This 80-week program is designed to produce graduates who are entrepreneurs in the development of interactive educational software that is based on multimedia learning design. Students learn how to combine digital sound, video, animation, graphics and other media into interactive educational experiences. Special Program Features This program has been designed to produce graduates capable of developing instructional software products that can compete in the international marketplace. Students therefore receive basic training in the entrepreneurial nature and often unique practices of the software development industry.</td><td valign="center"></td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="4"<td valign="center"> Industrial design deals with consumer products as well as industrial products. The Department The Department of Industrial Design has a multidisciplinary pedagogy and product design and development. The Industrial Design Program has specialized a studio experience for all students entering the second semester of freshmen year at the College of Design. Design Fundamentals focuses on exposure to the basic concepts of two- and three-dimensional design and provides a comprehensive introduction to the various fields of design. The faculty of the Department of Industrial Design firmly believe that there is an essential need for students in a research and technically-based university to engage in course work that fosters creative thinking.</td><td valign="bottom"><img height="200" width="300" src="http://www.cardesignnews.com/news/2001/010528cov-mdes2001/images/cov-ringquist.jpg"></td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="4"><td valign="top"><img height="213" width="300" src="http://www.cardesignnews.com/news/2001/010528cov-mdes2001/images/mdes2001-site.gif"></td><td valign="bottom"> .
