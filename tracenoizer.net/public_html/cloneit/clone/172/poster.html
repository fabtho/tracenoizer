 these are both exciting and difficult times in terms of teaching. They don't look at you as a teacher, like we did at Ruder. " - Hans-Rudi Lutz (1990) "One important thing is that we don't want people to see a poster of ours' as a cutout of some imaginary reality but as paper with color on it. And that's not just a technical approach; it's also a cultural statement. Because within our culture almost anything visual has to function as a cutout of some kind of reality.</td>
