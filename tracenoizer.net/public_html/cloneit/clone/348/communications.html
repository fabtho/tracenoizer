 The Family Radio Service ("FRS") is one of the Citizens Band Radio Services. It is for your family, friends and associates to communicate among yourselves within your neighborhood and while on group outings. You may use your FRS unit for business-related communications. Expect a communication range of less than one mile. FRS Rule 1 provides your authority to operate a FRS unit in places where the FCC regulates radio communications, as long as you use only an unmodified FCC certified FRS unit.</td>
