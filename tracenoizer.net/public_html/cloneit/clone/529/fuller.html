 . But he was also an outsider, a technical expert with a poet's imagination who by the 1930s had already developed theories on environmental issues and anticipated the rapid globalization of our planet. This visual reader documents and examines Fuller's theories, ideas, designs, and projects. It also takes an analytical look at his ideology of technology as panacea. It contains numerous illustrations, many published here for the first time, as well as texts by Fuller and the editors.</td>

 His designs and engineering philosophy are part of the foundation of contemporary high-tech design aesthetics. . Biography Buckminster Fuller and Shoji SadaoBuckminster Fuller invented the geodesic dome, and a wide range of other paradigm-shifting machines and structural systems. He was especially interested in high-strength-to-weight designs, with a maximum of utility for minimum of material. His designs and engineering philosophy are part of the foundation of contemporary high-tech design aesthetics.</td>
