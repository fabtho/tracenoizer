 . These vans had been constructed with a lockable cargo compartment, like a moving van. I was detailed with the gas-van to about twelve convoys of arriving Jews. With each arrival I made five or six trips with my van. I myself never shot a single Jew; I only gassed them.</td>

 I have seen the flag of the Jewish community of Prague (the flag currently hanging in the synagogue dates from the 16th century), which apparently was used whenever the community processed to the castle to renew their contract with the King, to ask him a boon as a group, or anything like that. ) This flag (or the part of it I can see in the slide without using a projector) doesn't have any obvious symbols of Prague, just a Jew's hat within a Star of David within a bordure of Hebrew script. ) I think the main reason "Jews didn't usually have a heraldic device of their own" is that very few of them were of noble families. Jewish communities, and trade guilds with significant Jewish membership, certainly had group heraldic symbols (which we would call "badges" in SCA heraldry). Well, the outrigger canoe probably dates into or before the European Middle Ages, but I agree it would certainly look jarring at an allegedly European feast or court.</td>

" The author is a non-Jew, as are the novelists she studied, which include Nobel Prize^-winner Heinrich Boll and Gunter Grass. The sequence of the authors' chapters follows roughly a chronological order, showing how the nature of the silence has changed over the decades. Schlant begins with a chapter examining the generation that tried, in the first postwar decade, to find its literary voice in what she calls the "literature of the rubble," and ends with a chapter that discusses the efforts of some novelists to introduce a dialogue between Jews and non-Jews. The author envisions some hope for the future, writing that this literature "has begun to express sorrow and mourning, and has started to acknowledge and include the Jewish presence in Germany. The book is thoughtful and innovative, riveting in its narrative, analysis, and details.</td>
