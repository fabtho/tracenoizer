 Terror and hunger, do destroy the personality of people. Only people that experienced this can understand this. It was Heydrich devilish plan to use extensively the victims manpower in the process of self- destruction. For example- all the crematoria were manned by Jewish Sondercommando. I do believe that an average person, facing the terror of hunger and death, will cooperate with his oppressor.</td>

 We saw our world as shattered by WWII and its aftermath, Jews disappeared - while the language with which we describe our own suffering is rich in nuance and texture, the language we use to describe the fate of Jews is abstract and devoid of emotional resonance. In my own research, I have found that many of my countrymen believe that there is in fact an abundance of literature written by German gentiles which deals with the plight of European Jews in general and German Jews in particular. In reality, there is a distinct absence of Holocaust victims as protagonists in literature written by German gentiles. Many if not most Germans seem to consider literature about their own suffering during WWII and the chaos of the postwar years, and condemnation of the Hitler regime as synonymous with writing about Holocaust victims. Not even by the roughly half a million German gentiles who had acquired Jewish relatives through marriage.</td>
