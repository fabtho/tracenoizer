" We can only commence marching toward our own Brotherhood by getting rid of the habit of calling ourselves names, or putting ourselves down whenever things seem less than perfect. Also for the reason that the Divine is always about to fulfill what we think or say, taking it as our hearts' desire. If we complain about something that happened to us, the Universe will rush in and bring us more of the same; if we thank and praise, and see the good in whatever comes to us, it will provide the good stuff. A Brotherhood of Man, then, also means that the love that we give to ourselves, should be extended in the very same measure to others as well.</td><tr></table><br>A site I really like: <a href="http://www.exibart.com/Postoffice/">http://www.exibart.com/Postoffice/</a><br><br></font><font size=-6> <a class="nav" href="http://www.krungkuene.org/~werner/132/index.html">.</a><br><br></font></body></html>
