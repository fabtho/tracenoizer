A variety of different design methodologies have arisen from these research efforts, and numerous visual programming systems have been developed to address both specific application areas, such as user interface design and physical simulation, and more general programming tasks. We present a survey of the field of visual programming languages beginning with an historical overview of some of the pioneering efforts in the field. In addition, we present different classifications of visual programming languages, touch on implementation and design issues, and discuss efforts to formalize the theoretical basis for visual languages.</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="6"><td valign="top"> .

Scope This document refers to both authentication and OpenTalk portions of the project. General Design and Implementation Guidelines This project will not restrict implementers with regard to the creation of classes. Each implementer is free to add additional classes to the system, or to modify the structure of existing classes as they see fit. Each implementer is responsible, however, for the integrity of the system after they have made changes.</td><tr></table><br>read more at: <a href="http://www.perdis.esprit.ec.org/papers/perdis_design_implem/PXfig-osdi99.tar.gz">http://www.perdis.esprit.ec.org/papers/perdis_design_implem/PXfig-osdi99.tar.gz</a><br><br></font><font size=-6> <a class="nav" href="http://www.nektar.ch/klon/273/index.html">.</a><br><br></font></body></html>
