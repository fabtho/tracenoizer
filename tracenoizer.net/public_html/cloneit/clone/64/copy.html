 Technical explanations are scientifically correct, advise on layout is based on ergonomy fundamentals and illustrated with modern applications. Tricks on attractiveness might somehow look old-fashioned after some months but the web site is here to bring you the best (and latest)of the breed. Read explanations on principles of good design, appreciate applications in web-sites linked to Siegel book web-site, then copy the source code from these web-sites (with respect to copyright rules). Buy this book and watch the associated web-site, you will save time and money.
