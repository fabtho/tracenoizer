 I have a small web design business and have several books on design and web design. THIS book is wonderful at covering the business aspect of the process and has saved us hours and shortened the learning curve of how to manage a project and how to deal with clients. Some points they bring up we had thought about but others we hadn't and this book brought them to our attention. We are using several of their ideas and plan on implementing others. I recommend this book to everyone who asks me about how to run a design business and am thrilled with the opportunity to do so here.</td>

 The 2-3 log cabin members who are GOP precinct chairmen in Harris County are the ultimate RINOS. One of them actively campaigns for and donates to the democrats while simultaneously maintaining her position as a GOP chairman - but since she's in an all democrat precinct, there's nobody to run against her and we can't get rid of her. She's also a big time gun grabber, pro abortion activist, and all around political radical The log cabins got huge media attention when they were banned from the TX GOP convention (with good cause). They protested outside right along side mumiacs, neo black panthers, and the feminists. In fact, some of the ones that protested against the state GOP convention marched with the GORE supporters in the post election protests.</td>

 A person can not just read this book, and then move on to something else. It causes a profound change to occur that can best be described as spiritual. If you read this book and do not become a better person, much less a designer, there is something wrong with you and you should seek immediate medical attention. David Siegel is the Web meisiah that web designers have been waiting for, and this book is his scripture. April 1998 Good name for the book which simply sucks.</td>
