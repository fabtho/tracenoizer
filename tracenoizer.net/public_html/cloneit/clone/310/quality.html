 The open review period for accepted articles will generate a small but useful amount of comment from readers. Editorial time and resources involved in the new process will be similar to that required for traditional peer review. Articles published after this review process will have fewer errors and be of higher quality than those published after traditional review. Of course access to the Internet is required for participation in the study. However, readers without Internet access who wish to see the eMJA Internet peer review study protocol (28 pages) should contact Craig Bingham (tel.</td>

 Peer Review Changes For Small Firms BY GARY FREUNDLICH AND WALTER H. WEBB EXECUTIVE SUMMARY THE AICPA REVISED ITS STANDARDS FOR PERFORMING and reporting on peer reviews for firms that do not audit SEC registrants. The new rules, which become effective January 1, 2001, are designed to improve the quality of financial reporting and to protect members of the public that use and rely on those reports. WHILE SOME OF THE REVISIONS APPLY to all of the more than 30,000 firms enrolled in the AICPA peer review program, they most notably affect nearly 18,000 small firms that perform only review or compilation engagements and do not perform audits. The revised standards also affect regulators, CPAs who perform peer reviews and state CPA societies.</td>
