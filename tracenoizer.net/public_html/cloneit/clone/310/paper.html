 . Example of an Out-of-class Peer Response Example of an Out-of-class Peer Response First, a few comments . This paper was originally written for a very different assignment, the definitional argument in E306. Nonetheless, it should give you some idea of the sort of analysis expected of you. Please don't panic if some of the terms seem strange; remember that, for the content of your response, you should rely on the worksheet I have provided.</td>

 And author and publisher share exactly the same interest in protecting that copyright from theft. No one else should be able to sell that author's words as his own, and no one should have access to them without paying for it. For paper publication DOES require a large investment, even in today's era of desktop publishing. The technology of print is not a trivial one, nor is it cheap. It would accordingly NOT be music to a struggling author's ears to hear that his limited print-run work, which was not selling all that well, was widely available and read in a contraband xerox edition for free (or rather, for the cost of polycopying).</td>

 have been asked to do more and more work on the newspapers in recent weeks, enabling Mr Desmond to keep his costs as low as possible, while upping the celebrity stakes. What seems certain is that Mr Townsend will offer little resistance to Mr Desmond's determination to demolish the Chinese walls that have traditionally separated editorial from commercial interests on newspapers. Mr Pilgrim's departure from the paper was precipitated by a series of incidents where Mr Desmond intervened in editorial judgments to demand a certain angle on a story. It seems certain that Mr Townsend would agree with Mr Desmond that it's better to keep Matthew Freud sweet than damage a contract that would give the Express and - more significantly - the Star access to Geri Halliwell. And it's hard to imagine Michael Pilgrim's lament, that "the paper will not be taken seriously" unless Mr Desmond ceases interfering, coming from the pen of Martin Townsend.</td>
