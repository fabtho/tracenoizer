We expect the practice of posting preprints to become nearly universal in ecology as it has become in physics, and it should not affect eligibility for consideration by our journals.

A necessary but not sufficient test for prior publication is whether the manuscript has appeared in some entity with archival value so that it is permanently available to reasonably diligent scholars.

 The Medical Journal of Australia Internet peer-review study. . In 1996 we launched the Journal's website with an experiment in using the Internet to open up peer review. In seven instances, this led to further revision of the articles before they were published in print. Nonetheless, the study suggested that most authors and reviewers are willing to explore more open methods of peer review and that the Internet can be used to enhance peer review while accelerating the publication process.</td>

 A high incidence of melanoma found in patients with multiple dysplastic naevi using photographic surveillance John W Kelly, Josephine M Yeatman, Cheryl Regalia, Grahame. . Search Internet Peer Review Study II In this study of new methods of peer review, articles submitted for publication are circulated to reviewers via the world wide web (using password-protected access) and the review process is conducted as an online discussion between the journal editors, reviewers, authors and a small panel of consultants who represent a wider range of expertise and journal readership. When an article is accepted for publication, both the article and the record of its review process are rapidly published on the world wide web for open review by the Journal's readers. After four weeks of open review, the article is finalised and published in print.</td>
