 My view has now moved on to the belief that there needs to be a separate protocol layer that deals with the articulation issues independently of any public-key structures. . In this thesis, we address the question of how to articulate and enforce boundaries of control on top of this platform, while enabling collaboration and sharing in a peer-to-peer environment. Principles and concepts from contract law are used to identify a generic way of representing the shared structure of different kinds of relationships.

 My salvation was that I was able to come up with interesting angles on standard topics for the many assigned research papers. But it frustrated me that I seemed unable to verbally explain or defend my written positions to the others in the class, including my professors. If I even thought about asking a question or contributing to the debate in any way, my heart would start pounding from a normal, sitting rate of 60 beats a minute to an alarming rate of about 150. When the heart beats that quickly, it is pumping too fast to deliver blood throughout the body. Consequently, I felt a bit light-headed and dizzy, almost to the point of worrying whether I was going to faint.</td>
