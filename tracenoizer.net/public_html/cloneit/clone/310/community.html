 The Review Branches of the awarding institutes and centers (ICs) manage the initial review groups that evaluate applications submitted in response to special solicitations and for unique programs. Rosters of the membership of peer review groups are available from CSR (Study Section Rosters ), as well as from the Review Branches of the awarding institutes and centers. The second level of peer review is carried out by the NIH National Advisory Councils ( NIH National Advisory Council Rosters, Meeting Schedule of NIH National Advisory Councils) which are composed of scientists from the extramural research community and public representatives. The councils ensure that the NIH receives advice from a cross-section of the US population in the process of its deliberation and decisions. If you experience technical problems accessing site pages or links, or if you have general questions, comments or suggestions, please contact the OER Webmaster.</td>
