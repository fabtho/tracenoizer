 . Prosecutors claim that in 1986 and 1987, Aprath issued nine batches of unscreened blood donated by an HIV-infected drug user. Three of the 14 patients who received those blood products have died of AIDS- related causes, and two more are infected with HIV. Eckert is also said to have distributed some 5,800 batches of frozen blood products to German hospitals, despite the fact that up to 90 percent had not been tested for the virus that causes AIDS. Separately, a court in Koblenz is scheduled to announce a verdict on Friday for four officials at UB Plasma, another manufacturer of blood products, who are charged with infecting three individuals with HIV.</td>

 Disease Induction The correlation between meat consumption and a wide range of degenerative diseases is well-founded and includes. Vegetarians tend to be thinner than meat-eaters (possible due to a higher fibre, low fat diet). Intestinal Toxemia and Transit Time Animal products can putrefy in the colon. Fiber also absorbs unwanted, excess fats; cleans the intestines; provides bulk and aids in peristalsis. Being healthier from a vegetarian diet means spending less on health care.</td>
