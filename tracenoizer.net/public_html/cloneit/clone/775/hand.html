Coming across the line, he couldn't even raise his arms and was absolutely exhausted. A repeat this year is unlikely, given the field, but another "unknown" may try his hand. Definitely not Erik Zabel, who will likely lose some his 124 point buffer to Andrei Tchmil. Could the perennially consistent Belgian pull off the incredible, and beat Zabel in a late charge for the World Cup.">
