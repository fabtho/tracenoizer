 Where does it rank among courses you'd like to play. As for the Masters, I'd prefer that they toughen up the course a bit (rough, etc. I want to see a golf tournament, not a putting contest. I wouldn't find it very interesting to put with some friends on my coffee table, and I don't find it very interesting to watch them put on the greens at Augusta.
