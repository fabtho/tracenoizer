 Once the two have been linked, the system is capable of identifying each possible failure mode, simulating it and recording the result. . DOUGAL This project extends the work from Aquavit and AutoSteve (see below) to develop "whole vehicle, whole lifecycle electrical design analysis". The project is to develop simulation techniques which enable automated design analysis (FMEA, sneak circuit analysis, design verification) using the most accurate information available at that point in the design process. GenMech The aim of the project is to investigate the feasibility of automating mechanical failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) for automotive subsystems employing qualitative reasoning techniques on representations of mechanical systems constructed from existing information sources such as CAD models and functional specifications.</td>
