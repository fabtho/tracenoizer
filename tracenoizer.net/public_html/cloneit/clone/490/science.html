 Choosing a university and a technical specialty, are two of the most important decisions of your professional career. To succeed as one of the engineers of tomorrow, you will need the specialized knowledge and experience only a comprehensive research university like Ohio State can offer. Since its establishment in 1894, the Department of Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) at The Ohio State University has earned the respect of industry leaders and academicians world-wide. The international reputation of the faculty, extensive research facilities, and the impressive capabilities of its graduates continue the tradition of excellence. Ohio State has been officially recognized by the prestigious Gourman Report as having one of the finest materials science departments in the country, ranking our undergraduate metallurgical program second in the nation, while the ceramics program is ranked third at both the undergraduate and graduate levels.</td>

 Petersburg, Florida, geomorphological structure of the mid ocean ridges. . Our general interest is in nonlinear science with special emphasis on dissipative pattern-forming systems and fully developed turbulence. In this active field of physics there is a very close contact between experimentalists and theorists. This enables us to compare our experimental results with both rigorous theory and general theoretical models.</td>
