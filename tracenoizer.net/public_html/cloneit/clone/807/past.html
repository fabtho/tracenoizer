 One of the first detective films to use the shadowy, nihilistic noir style was the work of director John Huston in the classic The Maltese Falcon (1941), famous for Humphrey Bogart's cool private eye hero Sam Spade. Alan Ladd and Veronica Lake were paired in two film noirs in the same year, The Glass Key (1942) and This Gun For Hire (1942), and were reteamed again in The Blue Dahlia (1946). One of the quintessential film noirs of the early period was director Jacques Tourneur's Out of the Past (1947), with Robert Mitchum playing the doomed, double-crossed private eye with one of the best of all femme fatales - Jane Greer. (1950), the story of a poisoned and doomed protagonist. Henry Hathaway's The House on 92nd Street (1945), Call Northside 777 (1948), The Naked City (1948), and Hitchcock's The Wrong Man (1956) were examples of documentary-style noirs.</td>
