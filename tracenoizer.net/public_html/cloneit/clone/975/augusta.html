 Nina's unflagging energy and boundless enthusiasm inspire and challenge, summoning each of us to become and to remain involved in our community. . Augusta is the perfect refuge from the pace and pressures of the city, its views of the lush Kentucky hillsides and the meandering Ohio river an allure that has attracted and inspired countless artists. Nora, who collects coins and Pokemon cards and has read every Harry Potter Book twice, aspires to be a marine biologist doctor and to live in Alaska and Japan. Judy Federer and Caroline Cigolotti, (seen above) members of the Augusta Art Guild, take time to exhibit some of the Guild members' works during the Augusta Regatta.</td>

 As for the Masters, I'd prefer that they toughen up the course a bit (rough, etc. I want to see a golf tournament, not a putting contest. I wouldn't find it very interesting to put with some friends on my coffee table, and I don't find it very interesting to watch them put on the greens at Augusta. The fairways are generous but you have to hit spots or you won't have a chance to be where you need to be on the green. The course is tempting and teases you into taking chances that can lead to huge numbers.</td>
