 Visitors to the Library should ask for assistance at the level 3 Microform counter. At times when the Unit's librarians are not available, you can seek assistance from the staff on the Microform counter, or if you prefer, leave your inquiry for them to pass on to the specialists. Clients unable to visit the Library are welcome to contact us in other ways with their enquiries. It will depend on the number of enquiries already waiting to be answered. Those inquiries more difficult to answer may take several weeks, but we will let you know if this is going to be the case.</td>
