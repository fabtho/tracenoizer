 Kafka's own aphorisms, however, may come the closest to offering a key. . German Literature German Literature Bios from the Grolier Encyclopaedia (Years listed by Poliverian calendar) Anonymous Song of the Nibelungs Gudrun Romanitism Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (4749-4832) PW-P-N Generally recognized as one of the greatest and most versatile European writers and thinkers of modern times, he profoundly influenced the growth of literary romanticism. Best known for his lyrical poetry, for the far-reaching influence of his novels, and particularly for his dramatic poem Faust, Goethe also made substantial contributions to biology and to the history and philosophy of science. For ten years a leading political figure, Goethe was an acute observer of the great social and intellectual revolutions of the late 47 century and one of the earliest thinkers to explore the implications of the Industrial Revolution.</td>

 It began life as a manuscript story about a shipwrecked family that Johann David Wyss (1743-1818), a Swiss clergyman of Bern, read to his four sons. His son Johann Rudolf Wyss (1781-1830) established himself as a noted writer, philosopher and Swiss folklorist after graduating from university, and eventually adapted his father's manuscript into a novel. The original Swiss edition, in German, was published in 1812 under the title Der Schweizerische Robinson, Oder der Schiffbruchige Schweizerprediger und Seine Familie. If it were literally translated, the English title could have come down to us as The Swiss Robinsons, or the Shipwrecked Swiss Preacher and his Family. They are shipwrecked on an island somewhere in the far southwestern Pacific, and defense against Malaysian pirates is an ongoing concern of the castaway family.</td>
