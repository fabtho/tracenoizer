The numbers used for analysis are averages and there is great variance in nutrient content for each food item in the database. The nutrient information is also not complete for every food listed in NAT as there are still gaps in our knowledge of food composition. With these limitations in mind, I believe that the tool can provide valuable information on the relative composition of food and I hope this tool will aid you in your quest to achieve or maintain good health via nutritious eating.
