 . We expect to be able to ship it to you within 3-5 weeks. Editorial Reviews From Booklist From the Rocky Mountain Institute (known for research and advocacy on environmental issues that are at once creative and practical) comes a detailed, step-by-step guide to involving a wide range of citizens in planning for sustainable community economic development. Urging that a "bottom-up" (rather than "top-down") process will both generate more ideas and produce broader support for the development projects ultimately adopted, the guide explains basic concepts of sustainable development, major approaches to community economic challenges, and key elements of collaborative decision making. Then author Kinsley (not the former Crossfire host, who's now 'zining in cyberspace with Bill Gates) spells out the eight-step "Economic Renewal" process, from mobilizing the community to developing project action plans.</td>
