 Working with engineers and managers in real-world PD environments, we extend our fundamental understanding of the product development process, and provide innovative improvements to current practice. . We unite representatives from academia, industry, and government who share our energetic vision of the future of product development. CIPD's Vision New products will be developed by just-in-time collaborations of globally-distributed teams linked seamlessly by web-based tools and processes. In pursuing this mission, we use industrial sites as our laboratories.</td>
