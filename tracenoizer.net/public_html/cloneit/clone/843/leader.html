 . Our struggle must remain non-violent and free of hatred. " -- Dalai Lama, Tibetan leader AS LEADER of the Tibetan people His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, leads a life of exile in India. After an uprising against Chinese rule 42 years ago, the Dalai Lama fled, followed by thousands of Tibetans. Over the decades the 66-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner and advocate of non-violence has continued to seek "genuine autonomy" for his homeland, a land that China considers to be an integral part of its territory.</td>

 Vice President to Meet With Dalai Lama; Tibet Advocates Unhappy World Tibet Network News Wednesday, September 13, 1995 2. Vice President to Meet With Dalai Lama; Tibet Advocates Unhappy By WILLIAM C. MANN WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Dalai Lama, the exiled Buddhist leader who won a Nobel Peace Prize for his nonviolent advocacy of self-rule for Tibet, will call Wednesday on Vice President Al Gore. President Clinton received the Tibetan spiritual and political leader during two previous visits to Washington but appeared to be avoiding a formal meeting with him this time so as not to irritate already raw relations with China. In making the low-keyed announcement of Wednesday's meeting, Gore's office said Clinton is expected to drop by.</td>
