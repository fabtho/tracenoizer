He is very large for his age and with his size and his full set of teeth, it makes this a problem which I am unsure of how to handle. One of the children that he has bitten has quite a mark on her cheek and the child's mother has said I need to get help for my son. I thought this may be a good forum to hear how common this is with other children his age. Any advice that you could give me would be appreciated.">
