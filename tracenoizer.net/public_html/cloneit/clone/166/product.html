 . Does the production process minimize energy or material input, packaging, waste production, land use and emissions of hazardous substances. If a short-lived product is necessary, have appropriate designs been developed for reduced material use, recycling and disposal. Are product functions designed to be self-controllable. Does the design aim to minimize material and energy input during use.</td>

 and to try to create new entrepreneurs in the service field. There will be a one or half day session reserved for 3S. Another possibility is to join the new UNEP working group on product service systems, which is looking for new partners for their work on a new research proposal. To contribute to the conference about product service systems in October 2001, which is organised by the Centre for Sustainable Design (UK) together with the TU Delft (NL). .</td>

 Within companies, a frequent bottleneck is the lack of coordination between design and marketing teams, says Ms. . Eco-design involves far more than creating a product that is easy to dismantle and recycle at the end of its lifetime, experts say. Successful eco-design also demands commitment from top management, and its principles must be integrated as a strategy from the birth of an idea through the design, manufacturing, marketing and entire life cycle of a product. Tischner, eco-design means developing a product that is ecologically, economically and socially sustainable.</td>
