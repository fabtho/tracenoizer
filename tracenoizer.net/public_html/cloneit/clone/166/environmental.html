com The structure and appearance of consumer products, the infrastructure and -- with increasing frequency -- the services we encounter in everyday life, is primarily the concern of designers and engineers. And it is to them we look to play an important role in the move towards a sustainable society. If the earth is to nurture an increasing number of people, we must learn to live within the limits of our environmental space. To do this we should make sure that the use of consumer goods is divided among the maximum number of people, in order to reduce the impact on the environment as much as we can. The principle of eco-efficiency should apply to the entire life cycle of goods, from the excavation of raw materials, through production and use to recycling and ultimate disposal.</td>
