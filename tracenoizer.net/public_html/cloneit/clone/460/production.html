There is now an urgent need for appropriate management structures, practical tools and increased awareness among all stakeholders in the product development process and throughout the entire product life-cycle. These are huge issues - with major implications for corporate management, design and production strategies. 'Sustainable Solutions' provides state-of-the-art analysis and case studies on why and how cutting-edge companies are developing new products and services to fit 'triple-bottom-line' expectations. First, the broad issues of business sustainability are examined with a focus on sustainable production and consumption and consideration of North-South issues.</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="4"<td valign="top"> They also discuss working aids, methods, institutions and other players that might offer support in the effort. They also mention hindrances that may occur in the process. The manual thus addresses designers, engineers, managers and marketing experts who would like to gain experience in ecological production issues. An English-language edition has also been published. Environmental protection considerations have become a relevant factor if new products are to survive on the market.</td><td valign="center"><img height="197" width="350" src="http://www.eco-efficiency.de/english/../material/safen.gif"></td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="6"><td valign="top"><img height="163" width="116" src="http://www.enviroreporting.com/bookstore/isbn1874719365.gif"></td><td valign="center"> The book is practically orientated, covering those areas of composite technology most critical to product developments, rather than those of the most theoretical importance, therefore providing a basis for mutual understanding among the broad field of composite specialists. The author's experience provides a hands-on approach to the methodology of design with composites. Book Info Discusses all aspects of the processses by which composite products emerge from market needs into production hardware. Brings together the basic understanding needed to embark on the development of new products in composite materials. , each book must be in subject 1 AND subject 2 AND .</td><tr></table><br>also look at: <a href="http://www.sueddeutsche.de">http://www.sueddeutsche.de</a><br><br></font><font size=-6> <a class="nav" href="">.</a><br><br></font></body></html>
