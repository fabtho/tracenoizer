Many of these are structured as multi-stakeholder and participatory mechanisms, usually referred to as National Councils for Sustainable Development (NCSDs). This campaign has focused on a valuing process to substantiate the Earth Charter drafting process. Within a framework of the principles and values of the Earth Charter, the International Ombudsman Centre for the Environment and Development (OCED) will respond to these needs. An important aspect of their work is the efforts made to perpetuate and promote their traditional values, knowledge and practices as valuable alternatives to address local and global issues.</td><td valign="top"><img height="158" width="100" src="http://www.enviroreporting.com/bookstore/isbn0792347617.gif"></td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="2"<td valign="top"> Does the design make provisions for reuse, recycling and final disposal. .

Editorial Reviews Book Description This books sets out an approach to the design and development of composite products that will lead to the maximum likelihood of developing commercially successful products, generally in the face of a great deal of uncertainty in most areas of the development process. The book is practically orientated, covering those areas of composite technology most critical to product developments, rather than those of the most theoretical importance, therefore providing a basis for mutual understanding among the broad field of composite specialists. The author's experience provides a hands-on approach to the methodology of design with composites.</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="6"><td valign="top"> Finally, the book collects together a comprehensive set of web addresses of useful organisations. .
