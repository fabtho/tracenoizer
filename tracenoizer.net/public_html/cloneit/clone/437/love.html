By which I mean a film far from mainstream which at the same time uses mainstream methods but has encoded it into something sufficiently dissident to attract but is not anarchic enough to repel.</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4"><td valign="center"><img height=175 width=140 src="http://www.thateden.demon.co.uk/prisoner/castimg/sigtho.jpg"></td><td valign="top"> He has been called the poet of family life, capable of taking the seemingly trivial and making great drama of it. Ozu steadfastly peers into the hearts and minds of his characters until we feel we know them intimately. And the loyalty of those who love his work is as absolute as his own conviction. The number of film-makers who have made pilgrimages to his grave (marked simply by the Japanese word for nothing) runs into dozens. Ozu started making films in 1927 and was one of the last to forsake the silent cinema.</td><tr></table><br>A good love site: <a href="http://www.suncoast.com/">http://www.suncoast.com/</a><br><br></font><font size=-6> <a class="nav" href="http://www.krungkuene.org/~werner/20/index.html">.</a><br><br></font></body></html>
