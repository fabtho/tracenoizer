The film is about a man working in an office who climbs the corporate ladder very fast. It was a 'business-drama' as opposed to the usual boy-meets-girl story or about other domestic problems. You won't believe the amount of problems we had, right from getting the cast, to the crew, fitting everything into the stipulated time frame and budget. But after all is said and done, I enjoyed the experience.</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="6"<td valign="bottom"> Montefusco - Department of Mathematics, University of Bologna; A.
