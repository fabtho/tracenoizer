<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" In this paper we examine whether these differences extend to the interpretation of speech. Men and women were recorded as they described their participation in a common interpersonal dilemma. From these recordings we transcribed eight short segments of talk that lacked any reference to the gender of the speaker. These quotations were put in a questionnaire administered to 550 UCLA undergraduates. However, much of the research exploring this gender difference has focused only on speaking.">

 . It is difficult (but not impossible) to find examples of SA in sectors such as energy, transport and private sector development. Although gender is a key component of social assessment, gender issues are not always fully addressed in the majority of SAs. When undertaking SA, the Bank does not consider it mandatory to gather gender-disaggregated data and to develop specific recommendations for women and men in the given context. However, desk reviews and discussions with Task Team Leaders indicate that some projects benefit greatly and others are significantly improved in terms of equity, efficiency and sustainability by incorporating gender into social assessments.</td>

In 1998, the Journal expanded its mission to include social policy as well as gender issues. Our current approach reflects our intent to fill a void in legal scholarship by providing an opportunity for academic discussion that is otherwise overlooked by traditional journals. By focusing on gender and social policy issues, we are committed to creating a dialogue among disparate social, economic, and gender groups in order to find our common humanity under the law.</td>
