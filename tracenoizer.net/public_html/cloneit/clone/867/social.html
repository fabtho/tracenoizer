 We hope that our holistic approach to legal analysis will promote the empowerment all individuals in our society and strengthen the role of progressive perspectives in mainstream legal scholarship. . In 1998, the Journal expanded its mission to include social policy as well as gender issues. Our current approach reflects our intent to fill a void in legal scholarship by providing an opportunity for academic discussion that is otherwise overlooked by traditional journals. By focusing on gender and social policy issues, we are committed to creating a dialogue among disparate social, economic, and gender groups in order to find our common humanity under the law.</td>
