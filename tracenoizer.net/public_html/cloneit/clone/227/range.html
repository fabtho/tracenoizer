 . fsb - allgood Single-minded as his life has been, it comes as no surprise that Franco Clivio will often query the finality of things.

 Magnussen, however, is one of several designer collections commissioned by FSB. Along with other designers such as Philippe Stark, Franco-Clivio, Hartmut Weise and Dieter Rams this forms part of FSB's response to the ever growing demand for designer fittings at surprisingly competitive costs. The Glencar Range has a new style and superb springing mechanism. The 1500 push-to-release window fastener's superb engineering coupled with its attractive design make this an excellent fastener which offers "security with style". New to Basta range are handles and espagnolettes suitable for use with the PVC-u steel, aluminium and timber windows.</td>
