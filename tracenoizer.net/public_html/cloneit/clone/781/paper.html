 5-inch computer disk, either in WordPerfect or ASCII format. Abstract should be typed on a separate page and should not exceed 100 words. This is an essential part of the paper; lack of an abstract may delay publication. Tables should be typed on a separate sheet of paper and numbered consecutively with respect to citation in the text. They should be self-explanatory and should supplement, not duplicate, the text.</td>

 Any unauthorised use, copying or mirroring is prohibited. . On a couple of occasions the camera shows us the narration in the process of being written down - a close-up of words typed on to the page, in detail so fine that you can see the keys making an impression on the paper and the blotch of ink from the typewriter ribbon spreading like a stain. It's a familiar device, almost a cliche, but in this instance the intensity of the close-up seems to give the typed words - "this is a diary of hate" - an emphatic physicality. They are inscribed on to the page with a force that seems like violence.</td>

 At the same time, the Scouts themselves provide services to their communities. Boyce first brought Scouting to America in 1911, its program has always included service to others. During World War I, Scouts collected paper and metal for recycling. In recognition of their efforts, Congress gave the Boy Scouts of America a special congressional charter in 1916. My troop, for example, works the parking lots and does the clean-up for our parish festival each year.</td>
