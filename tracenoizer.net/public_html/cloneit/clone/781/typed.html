 Published guides to MS sources, which include holdings of Edinburgh University Library . .Finding Aids Finding Aids The principal finding aid is the alphabetical Index to Manuscripts, consisting of typed slips in sheaf binders. It is chiefly a name index, but contains a number of subject entries. A printed edition of this Index was published by G.</td>

 In other words, the computer's ability to aid us in answering questions about data depends on the level of information that we provide to the computer about that data. Definitions Before proceeding I want to define three terms from computer science literature that can help in understanding and appreciating some differences between the levels of organization that can be provided in an electronic publication. These terms are meta-data, strongly typed, and softly typed. For example, you understand that the half-inch of space before some lines on this page are paragraph indentions, and that a paragraph represents some break in the discussion. For a computer, meta-data is the set of explicit instructions which help it understand some level of organization in the information.</td>

 The meaning of the logical connectives of Kleene s logic is given by the following truth tables. A characterization of the class of (object )logics to be represented. Using typed lambda calculus to implement formal systems on a machine. The idea is to exploit the idea of an isomorphism between propositions and types, so that terms inhabiting a type are isomorphic to proofs of the corresponding proposition. The great advantage of this is that substitution for terms and formulae comes practically for free, since there is already .</td>
