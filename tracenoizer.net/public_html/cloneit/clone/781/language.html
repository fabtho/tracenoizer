 Published as SIGPLAN Notices 24(10), October, 1989. . An Efficient Implementation of Self, a Dynamically-Typed Object-Oriented Language Based on Prototypes - Chambers, Ungar, Lee (ResearchIndex) A. We have developed and implemented techniques that double the performance of dynamically-typed object-oriented languages. Our SELF implementation runs twice as fast as the fastest Smalltalk implementation, despite SELF's lack of classes and explicit variables.</td>

 Also because it is very hard when you have limited resources (and who hasn't) to make cleaning up and splitting in pieces a priority versus just adding the new features everybody wants (that is until we get some magic where people can more easily add and share and interoperate the features themselves and core people can concentrate on meeting the extensibility goals and making sure that people doing extensions can do their job instead of doing (only some) of features. Now obviously it will be much faster with today C compilers than with today VM technology but it should be usable in both, and once you discount the vm overhead, the Java should not be much less efficient. This is for sure not applicable for the PalmPilot version but just a way to potentially have a(nother) cool scripting language for java. It might be asking too much contortions with the other goals though, that's why it's almost the last one in the list (read might be dropped first). x object system where object shimmers between 2 (or more) internal types depending on their use.</td>

 From the website of the textbook I used last term in AI, there is a lot of example code. There is code for the ID3 algorithm and decision trees. Since I started my project later than most due to my New York trip, I decided I needed to use a language that was easy to use, quick to develop, and had sophisticated file input and screen output. PHP has this, and even though PHP isn't a declarative or procedural language, I decided it was best under the circumstances. In addition, some flavors of Prolog can't handle real numbers, which the ID3 algorithm requires.</td>
