 The species, Canis familiaris, includes all breeds of the domestic dog. Although we can argue that there is little similarity between a Chihuahua and a Saint Bernard, or that established breeds are separate entities among themselves, they all are genetically the same species. Each breed was developed by close breeding and inbreeding among a small group of founding canine ancestors, either through a long period of genetic selection or by intensely inbreeding a smaller number of generations. The process established the breed's characteristics and made the dogs in it breed true. When evaluating your breeding program, remember that most traits you're seeking cannot be changed, fixed or created in a single generation.</td>

 For information on linking and other uses of my material see my copyright page. . If you breed even one litter you are, by definition a breeder. This page is intended to help you think about what it takes to become that caring and responsible breeder. When I first started hearing about truly ethical and responsible breeders I was amazed and very pleased.</td>
