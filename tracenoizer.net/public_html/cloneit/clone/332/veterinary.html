 . Schweizer, DVM, Diplomate ACT This authoritative yet straightforward guide discusses the preparations required -- and the challenges -- of getting mares pregnant. Schweizer covers such topics as the mare's anatomy, the reproductive system, and the importance of teasing and veterinary monitoring. The Cornell University instructor also examines the different breeding methods, including artificial insemination. Schweizer discusses ways to optimize the chances of conception through various management techniques and how to deal with infertility.</td>

 He completed the 5-mile run in 48 minutes, 2 seconds. Kramer came to Reunion with his family (who loved the experience), including 6-year-old daughter Becky who will be in the CVM class of 2015. Everyone I met at the Veterinary College--students, staff, and faculty--made me feel welcome, and also good about the state of veterinary education at Cornell. I had a lot of fun with my classmates and many nostalgic moments walking around campus. A first for me, I climbed up the bell tower, watched a concert, and had a great view.</td>
