 It was packed with updated information, delivered in a very easy, professional style. The short sections, each with its own heading, made it easy to digest and also to reference certain points at a later stage. It gave enough facts to work out how much money, knowledge and work is involved, acting as a deterrant if you were after making a quick buck. I like the way this particular information remained factual and unemotive. Some books written by breeders can be very sanctimonious and patronizing towards newcomers over why and whether they should breed dogs.</td>

 Is your mare healthy and free of hereditary conformation faults or diseases that may be passed on to her foal. Do you have somewhere safe to keep a mare and newborn foal. Mare Breeding Soundness Evaluation, by Christine Schweizer, DVM, discusses the various criteria involved in assessing a mare's suitability as a brood mare. Choosing a Stallion Once you have decided to breed your mare, the next step is choosing a stallion. The stallion should be selected to complement the mare's conformation and personality, not to exaggerate any faults she may have.</td>
