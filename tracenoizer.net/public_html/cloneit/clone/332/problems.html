 You may have possible vet bills if the puppies require extra attention. If some of the puppies die, or you have a smaller than usual litter, you may not get as much money from the sale of the puppies as you had though. There are even potential problems later on with dissatified customers. You are better off consulting with a financial wizard about investing the money you would otherwise spend and lose on breeding. Breeders frequently count themselves _lucky_ if they break even.</td>

 Ramey describes the various types of colic and the recommended course of treatment for each. Ball In an essential guide for horse owners and barn managers, Cornell University veterinarian Michael A. Ball focuses on how to be observant and prevent potential problems before they occur. One chapter is devoted to foaling and neonatal emergencies. Cable How to insure a healthy foal, what happens during delivery, and problems that can develop in foals are among the topics covered in this book.</td>

 And, that's really what you are trying to do -- improve the breed by improving on your bitch. You know you love your bitch, that's not in question here, but if you can't be honest about her flaws, then you can't fix them in a future generation. You'll want to focus on one, maybe two, problems that you'd like to see improved and look for a stud dog who is strong in those areas without being too weak in some other area. It can become a delicate balancing act -- of course, with no guarantee of success. There are two main theories in breeding that you'll want to understand.</td>
