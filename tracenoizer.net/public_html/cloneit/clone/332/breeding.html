 Schweizer, DVM, Diplomate ACT This authoritative yet straightforward guide discusses the preparations required -- and the challenges -- of getting mares pregnant. Schweizer covers such topics as the mare's anatomy, the reproductive system, and the importance of teasing and veterinary monitoring. The Cornell University instructor also examines the different breeding methods, including artificial insemination. Schweizer discusses ways to optimize the chances of conception through various management techniques and how to deal with infertility. Anyone who owns a mare will benefit from this important book.</td>

 Eberhardt When a mare and a stallion meet, love might be in the air. Particularly when humans get in the middle of it all. As a result, every breeding manager must make safety a first priority for all the parties involved--the handlers', the stallion, and the mare. Stallions can be formidable, especially when in the presence of an ovulating mare; their aggressive behavior is a risk factor in itself. And while a mare in season is generally in a receptive mood, that doesn't mean she is not capable of aiming a good kick in her suitor's direction--or her handlers'.</td>
