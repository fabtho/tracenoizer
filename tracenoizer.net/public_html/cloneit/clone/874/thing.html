 Although if you are using Internet Exploror, you'll get a javascript error instead of the popups. On the plus side you get a guestbook to sign into again. I've removed the front page hitcounter as I but there is still an stats thing on the Welcome page. I've also removed most of my awards and many of the websites that gave them to me are no longer around. The latest addition to the page, is the 1989 CCA Guidelines.</td>

 I had too much pressure to work, academically, too much academic pressure, but mainly - um - I was being bullied. I mean not physically kind of bullied, but I was facing a lot of rejection. And there was no one incident, thing that I'd said, or anything I'd done that I could see would have caused it. My parents took this problem to my "head of year" who talked to those pupils concerned. He then sent for me and told me that it was just me being "hypersensitive" and "over-reactive" to the situation.</td>

 The first real Star Wars story in, at the time, eight years. Did Lucasfilm give you any guidance or areas that you could not veer off into. Sort of like an "I would run until I ran into a wall" type of thing. I had a sort of history of the Clone Wars set up because at that time I didn't know he (George Lucas) was going to go back and do more movies, so I thought that was opened at length as well, but it turned out it wasn't. And I would run into minor walls here and there, both in the outline and in the final manuscript.</td>
