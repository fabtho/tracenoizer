 Over the years we have concentrated our efforts in Essex County, hence our name. Some book dealers attempt to cover the entire spectrum of genealogical research, however, we at Essex feel we can make a more meaningful contribution and provide more help to our fellow genealogists by focussing on the area we know best. Most of the books and CDs we sell, are used in our own research. We also encourage you to add your name to the Essex-BooksE-Mail list. Those on this list share information on books relative to Essex County and receive e-mail notification of new books as they are released by us along with other genealogy news and information.</td>
