 .) They are special buildings because they are quite energy efficient and relatively simple to build. Buckminster Fuller, also known as "Bucky" Fuller, designed this building. He had many ideas on how to make buildings cheaper to build by using materials and building techniques in non-traditional ways. This geodesic dome building was built in Montreal, Canada in 1967 and it was quite a strange sight.</td>

 . The design is a simple geodesic dome ala Buckminster Fuller. gif The building footing and the telescope base are of poured concrete. The two foundations are separated as far as possible. The building foundation is a ring of the appropriate size placed just deep enough to be below the frost line.</td>
