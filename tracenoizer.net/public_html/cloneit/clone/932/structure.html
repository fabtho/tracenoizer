 . Social issues aside, geodesic construction remains one of the most eficient means of creating space. Fuller himself explained the beauty of the geodesic structure when he wrote "The largest volume, least event, omnitriangular system is the icosahedron and its multiple subtriangulated 'geodesic' patterning. "(1) For Buckminster Fuller, geodesic fabrication was a means of easily creating pure forms and pure expression of form. By ignoring the diversity of options that geodetic construction allows, Fuller was limited in his work to sphereical buildings.</td>

 Twice expelled from Harvard University, business disasters and the death of his four year old daughter brought him close to suicide. However he decided to devote himself to proving that technology could save the World from itself, providing it is properly used. He examined a vectorial system of geometry, Energetic-Synergetic geometry, based on the tetrahedron which provides maximum strength with minimum structure. This led to his patent of a geodesic dome in 1947, a building the strength of which need only increase as the log of its size. Fuller was research professor at Carbondale, Southern Illinois University, from 1959 to 1968.</td>
