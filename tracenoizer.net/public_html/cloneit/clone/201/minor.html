 When the editors of the Bach-Gesellschaft were confronted with oboe parts in one key and string, voice, and organ parts in another, they simply transposed the oboe parts to the key of the others. These transposed parts often take the oboe below its range. If one views the oboe parts in the Bach-Gesellschaft as Terry did, without considering the fact that the original parts for some of the cantatas were actually notated a major second or a minor third higher, it would appear that the oboes are taken out of their range. In all instances, the oboe parts in those cantatas written for Muehlhausen and Weimar, which contain notes below the oboe's range, have either been transposed down a major second or a minor third. He treated the organ and trumpets as transposing instruments.</td>

 Bach's Method of Transcription Bach's Method of Transcription by Philip Hii Among the huge corpus of works by J. Their impact on the area of performance practice and the study of Bach's compositional process is evident in a number of notable studies. 1 Perhaps one of the most neglected of Bach's works in this genre is the relatively obscure clavier transcription (BWV 964) of the A minor Sonata for solo violin (BWV 1003). One of only four surviving clavier sonatas by Bach, the work is a fascinating essay in the art of transcription and is particularly instructive for guitarists as it provides a first-hand look at the concerns and priorities that influenced Bach's compositional process, and resolves some of the more problematical aspects of adapting Bach's music for the guitar. How much, for instance, should technical considerations influence musical content.</td>
