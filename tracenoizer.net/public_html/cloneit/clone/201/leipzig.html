 In 1720 Maria Barbara died while Bach was visiting Karlsbad with the prince; in December of the following year Bach married Anna Magdalena Wilcke, daughter of a court trumpeter at Weissenfels.

 These compositions included Six Grand Overtures, Op. . Bach, Johann Christian (1735 - 1782) Bach, Johann Christian (1735 - 1782) The youngest son of Johann Sebastian Bach by his second wife, Johann Christian Bach was born in Leipzig in 1735 and on the death of his father in 1750 moved to Berlin to live with his brother C. He later travelled to Italy, where he studied with the famous Padre Martini, became a Catholic and was employed for a short time as organist at Milan Cathedral. In 1762 he moved to London as a composer of Italian opera, like Handel fifty years before him, and enjoyed a considerable reputation there for a number of years, establishing a series of subscription concerts with his colleague Abel.</td>

 In that position Bach had no opportunity for writing or composing church music because most of his attention was turned to the composition of instrumental music. By the time Bach came to Coethen, Prince Leopold had acquired a small orchestra of professional players. When Bach moved to Leipzig in 1723, he found the available instrumentalists inadequate in number and in skill for his purposes. In his Short but most necessary Draft for a well-appointed Church Music. Thomas School were often called upon to fill in for the musicians that Bach requested in vain.</td>

 History shows no record of Bach's having subsequently visited the Margrave at his Brandenburg Court. The Margrave was not easily accessible as he was more frequently to be found in residence at his estates at Malchow than in Berlin. Moreover the death of Johann Kuhnau, Cantor of the Thomasschule at Leipzig in June 1722 opened the possibility of an appointment for Bach at Leipzig, perhaps more attractive to him than Berlin. The merits of various candidates to succeed Kuhnau were considered, and the Council eventually nominated Georg Philipp Telemann. However, the authorities at Hamburg would not release Telemann, and so the candidature was left pending.</td>
