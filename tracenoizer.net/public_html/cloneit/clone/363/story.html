It began life as a manuscript story about a shipwrecked family that Johann David Wyss (1743-1818), a Swiss clergyman of Bern, read to his four sons. His son Johann Rudolf Wyss (1781-1830) established himself as a noted writer, philosopher and Swiss folklorist after graduating from university, and eventually adapted his father's manuscript into a novel. The original Swiss edition, in German, was published in 1812 under the title Der Schweizerische Robinson, Oder der Schiffbruchige Schweizerprediger und Seine Familie.">

 A mere half a star, mostly for young Jack and the island, the only really interesting parts of the story. . The Disney film (if you can believe this) makes the story better--though the love between certain characters loses much in translation, the sheer length begs abridgement. The island is too conveniently spiffy, and the many superfluous passages about building additional homes and the uses of various unlikely plants could be cut without regret. I'd rather read Robinson Crusoe for a good marooning tale.</td>

 . The Swiss Family Robinson, by David Wyss The Robinson family lost at sea -- Vroni and the wondrous island Based on The Swiss Family Robinson by David Wyss Publication anecdote Apparently, the publication history for Robinson is a long one, and entirely posthumous. The story was collected together and published by David Wyss's son, Rudolph Wyss, and published for the first time in 1912. The original author did not publish the book himself. The story was one that David Wyss had orally told to children during his lifetime -- many years later his son decided to put it down onto paper.</td>
