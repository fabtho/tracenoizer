<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" In order to accomplish this requirement, the Ly- grating was produced by holography in order to obtain better stray light properties than those for mechanically ruled gratings. In addition, the Ly- resonant line is blocked by an opaque strip mounted in front of the Ly- detector face to avoid the saturation of the detector and scatter in the detector window. The blocker is placed in such a way that in the grating launch lock position it does not block any line of interest in the wavelength range of the Ly- channel, but, when the grating is moved to perform the electron scattered Ly- profile measurement, the strip completely blocks the Ly- resonant line for unvignetted telescope areas used for observations up to 4 R. ..">

The FSS will be used to test range systems (such as command links) prior to missions and to monitor their performance during missions. System Description The FSS is a spectrum monitoring and direction finding system that can remotely control up to 13 surveillance sites.
