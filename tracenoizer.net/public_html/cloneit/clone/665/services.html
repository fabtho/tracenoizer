<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" In 2000-01 Maruti was able to sell spare parts worth Rs. This had, to some extent, helped the company cushion itself from the impact of heavy depreciation on its third plant. The setting up of fully equipped authorized services along the highway is expected to enable the car owners to avail of the facility every 25-30 km along the route. The exercise will also help the company to check the use of spurious spare parts and components by unauthorised roadside mechanics. Work on setting up authorized services centre has begun and centers are being set up every week, company sources stated.">
