 Jesse is documented as the son of Elijah by both his father's 1855 Perry Co, KY will and Dickey Diary Interviews. His marriage to Polly BOLLING is documented by the Perry Co, KY Groom's Index and the 1914 Perry Co, KY death certificate of their daughter, Alsey. Jesse's birth and death dates and Polly's birth date are documented by the Jesse Combs Family Records (see below), and the locations by Perry Co, KY records. He also appeared on the 1820 Clay Co, Kentucky census, and from 1830-1870 on the Perry Co, KY census. Also note that The Combes Genealogy includes errors in regard to the children of Jesse (see below).</td>
