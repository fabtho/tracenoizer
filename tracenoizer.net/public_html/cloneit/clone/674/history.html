 , each book must be in subject 1 AND subject 2 AND . . The result is a sympathetic, yet still critical and complex portrait of the club and its founder, Clifford Roberts, to whom golf history has not been particularly kind. Indeed, for better--and for worse--Roberts and Augusta remain linked throughout what is essentially a volume that weaves biography with social history played against a sporting canvas. Augusta National would be just another golf club with a fancy pedigree and history of exclusion were it not for the remarkable tournament that it hosts every year.</td>

Those emerald fairways and vexing greens provide a tidy frame of reference for a game that thrives on putting things in context. "Every year, history is made here," Phil Mickelson said simply. "Something occurs that we remember forever -- every single year. " Who can forget Jack Nicklaus' back-nine charge to a record sixth green jacket in 1986.</td>

 It is the quintessential cold war comedy with the often caricatured shot of a Slim Pickens (Taggart from Blazing Saddles) as Major T. Also worth noting is the young James Earl Jones (Yes good old Darth Vador's voice). He has a small part as Lieutenant Lothar Zogg, but you can definitely catch some deep vocal overtones from that voice that soon helped to make him a permanent fixture in movie history. I don't want to say too much more (because I know you will see it), but pay particular attention to a hilarious bit if dialogue between the two presidents. .</td>
