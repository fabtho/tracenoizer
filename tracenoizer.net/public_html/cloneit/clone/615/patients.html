<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" . There is increasing evidence that hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection of an immunosuppressed host is associated with the appearance of virus mutants. To characterize the virus circulating in patients in detail, eleven full-length HBV genomes, isolated from the serum of five highly viraemic renal transplant recipients with liver disease, were cloned and sequenced. The mutations occurred at different positions and in various combinations; even mutant genomes circulating within a patient differed strikingly. It is concluded that long-term immunosuppression is associated with the occurrence of heterogeneous populations of partially defective HBV characterized by a specific mutation pattern.">

 At least in 5 patients with CNGA3 mutations residual cone photoreceptor function associated with better visual function and clear color discrimination abilities was found, indicating that mutations in the CNGA3 gene do not necessarily cause RM. . Here we present the results of a screening for CNGA3 mutations in patients with RM and other types of cone photoreceptor dystrophies, which enables us to establish a first comprehensive mutation spectrum of the CNGA3 gene. In 6 cases only a single heterozygous mutation could be found. 10 of the mutations were observed recurrently in different families.</td>
