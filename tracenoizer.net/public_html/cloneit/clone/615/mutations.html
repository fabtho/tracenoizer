A new hot spot for mutations in the ret protooncogene causing familial medullary thyroid carcinoma and multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A. One hundred and eighty-one families with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN-2A) or familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC) have been investigated for mutations in the ret protooncogene in Germany. In 8 families with FMTC or MEN-2A, no mutation could be detected in the cysteine-rich domain encoded in exons 10 and 11 of the ret protooncogene.">

 At least in 5 patients with CNGA3 mutations residual cone photoreceptor function associated with better visual function and clear color discrimination abilities was found, indicating that mutations in the CNGA3 gene do not necessarily cause RM. . Here we present the results of a screening for CNGA3 mutations in patients with RM and other types of cone photoreceptor dystrophies, which enables us to establish a first comprehensive mutation spectrum of the CNGA3 gene. In 6 cases only a single heterozygous mutation could be found. 10 of the mutations were observed recurrently in different families.</td>

 Simulations reveal that neither all a priori invariances are retained, nor the invariance against linear transformation is achieved. . Invariance, Self-Adaptation and Correlated Mutations in Evolution Strategies (ResearchIndex) A. A conceptual objective behind the self-adaptation of the mutation distribution is to achieve invariance against certain transformations of the search space. In this paper, a priori invariances of a simple evolution strategy and invariances, which can be introduced by selfadaptation, are identified.</td>

 . For each patient the whole coding sequence and all splice sites were studied for aberrations either by the protein truncation test (PTT), temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) of genomic PCR products, or mostly by direct genomic sequencing (DGS) of all individual exons. A total of 301 sequence variants including 278 bona fide pathogenic mutations were identified. As many as 216 of the genuine mutations, among them 179 different ones, can be considered novel when referring to the most recent review in the field (Upadhyaya and Cooper, 1998). Mutation detection efficiencies of the different screening methods were very similar to each other, 47.</td>
