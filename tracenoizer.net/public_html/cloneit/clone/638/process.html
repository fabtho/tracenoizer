This usage of process should not be confused with usages of the word in different contexts (e. operating system processes) SEEs that provide substantial process services are sometimes referred to as process centered, processmanaged, or process oriented SEEs. or for an organization, or they may be objects that the process developer may build into the model.</td>

 Screen for catalytic effects of candidate materials, corrosion products, feed impurities. . P2 In Chemical Process Design Battelle's On-Line Pollution Prevention Library Pollution Prevention in Process Development and Design Originally prepared for the McGraw-Hill publication, Industrial Pollution Prevention Handbook, edited by Harry Freeman. The following article discusses strategies for including pollution prevention in the design of new processes. Process development is also understood to include experimental studies at the laboratory, bench-scale, and pilot-plant level.</td>
