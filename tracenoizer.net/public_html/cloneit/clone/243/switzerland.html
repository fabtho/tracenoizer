 In the Biennale, 449 designers from 47 countries are represented, with Japan beeing the group with the most participants (81), followed by the Czech Republic (53) and Germany (36). For the first time, the graphic designers from China contributed in large numbers (31). Among the prize winners, Switzerland stands out with 4 awards from a total of 15. Surprisingly, none of the many excellent designs from Japan found the jury's favor this year. Thank you, jury member Kari Piippo, for correcting my mistake.</td>
