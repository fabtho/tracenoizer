 " Reporter Aileen Pincus and Reuters contributed to this report. . EDT (0344 GMT) WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A seemingly harmless genetic mutation can cause one kind of inherited colorectal cancer, researchers reported Monday. The discovery has made possible a blood test for the defect which will be available soon, they said. Researchers at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, who discovered the mutation, said it causes familial colorectal cancer (FCC), which accounts for between 15 percent and 50 percent of all cases of colon cancer.</td>
