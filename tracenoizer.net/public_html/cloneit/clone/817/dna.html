 Family studies are a good way to learn about DNA profiling and RFLP analysis because you can follow the inheritance of DNA markers (alleles) from one generation to the next. . Blackett Family DNA Activity Blackett Family DNA Activity Introduction Welcome to the Blackett Family DNA Activity. As part of his training, he made a DNA profile of his own family using a technique called RFLP analysis. Family studies are a good way to learn about DNA profiling and RFLP analysis because you can follow the inheritance of DNA markers (alleles) from one generation to the next.</td>

 If you have additional suggestions for this section, contact the author about including open-ended inquiry that you have developed for your students. . Overview of Blackett Family DNA Activity Blackett Family DNA Activity 2 Overview DNA Analyst Bob Blackett has graciously provided The Biology Project with sample data from his own work. In this activity, you will learn the concepts and techniques behind DNA profiling of the 13 core CODIS "Short Tandem Repeat" loci used for the national DNA databank. How can STR data from close relatives be used to create a genetic profile of a missing person.</td>

 The variety in the sequence of the base pairs accounts for the variety of life forms. . Background Information Although the pairs formed between the nucleotide bases in DNA are very specific (A with T and G with C) there is no restriction to the order in which the bases are arranged on a particular DNA strand. This allows a tremendous amount of information to be stored in the long molecule of DNA. The sequence of bases can be varied in countless ways to form the code for genetic information.</td>
