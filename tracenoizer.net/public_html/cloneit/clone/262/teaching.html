 . The scope of the study targets knowledge of a foreign language and culture about which they know nothing at the outset. During this school year the French and Italian classes will communicate by teleconference and Internet and will teach each other about their language and cultures, choosing the multimedia tools which seem best adapted to this form of teaching. VALASPI aims to define the cost-benefit relationship of this method of introductory teaching and to establish a model which would facilitate the widespread use of experience to other age groups, the general public and other areas of the training and education sector. VALASPI's pedagogical approach The project provides for pupils to learn essential elements of their language and culture and then teach what they have discovered in turn to other fellow pupils.</td>
