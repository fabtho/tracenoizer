He would in all probability use the process only to further delay the transfer of the bank documents, they said. The five sets of documents brought to India in January had shown Italian businessman Ottavio Quattrocchi and his wife Maria, former Bofors agent Win Chadha, his late wife Kanta and son Harsh as the beneficiaries of the payoffs.
