The Swiss Family Robinson, by David Wyss The Robinson family lost at sea -- Vroni and the wondrous island Based on The Swiss Family Robinson by David Wyss Publication anecdote Apparently, the publication history for Robinson is a long one, and entirely posthumous. The story was collected together and published by David Wyss's son, Rudolph Wyss, and published for the first time in 1912. The original author did not publish the book himself. The story was one that David Wyss had orally told to children during his lifetime -- many years later his son decided to put it down onto paper.</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2"><td valign="top"> Even if this comes about, the documents were likely to be passed on to India only by December.

This gives the father an opportunity to teach his children some values about life and civilization. The Swiss Robinson was published by Johann Rudolph, Wyss' son, in 1812. Hetzel, French publishers, modified the story under the title of The New Swiis Robinson (1864, illustrated byr Yann Dargent).
