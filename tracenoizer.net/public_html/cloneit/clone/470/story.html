The Disney film (if you can believe this) makes the story better--though the love between certain characters loses much in translation, the sheer length begs abridgement. The island is too conveniently spiffy, and the many superfluous passages about building additional homes and the uses of various unlikely plants could be cut without regret. I'd rather read Robinson Crusoe for a good marooning tale.</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4"><td valign="bottom"> Permission is granted for nonexclusive use of the Children's Storybooks Online logo at the top of this page for purposes of reference or promotion related to this site. . - by Carol Moore - An illustrated story It Could Happen.

The Swiss Family Robinson, by David Wyss The Robinson family lost at sea -- Vroni and the wondrous island Based on The Swiss Family Robinson by David Wyss Publication anecdote Apparently, the publication history for Robinson is a long one, and entirely posthumous. The story was collected together and published by David Wyss's son, Rudolph Wyss, and published for the first time in 1912. The original author did not publish the book himself. The story was one that David Wyss had orally told to children during his lifetime -- many years later his son decided to put it down onto paper.</td><td valign="bottom"></td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="0"<td valign="top"> . He is the author of The Swiss Robinson, one of the most popular adaptation of Defoe's Robinson Crusoe. Johann David Wyss used to read Defoe's story to his children, but unlike Robinson Crusoe, Wyss' shipwreck involves a whole family. This gives the father an opportunity to teach his children some values about life and civilization. The Swiss Robinson was published by Johann Rudolph, Wyss' son, in 1812.</td><td valign="top"></td><tr></table><br>also look at: <a href="http://www.genealogy.com/cgi-bin/linkcount.cgi?Desc=GENFORUMHISTCHAN&Target=http://www.historychannel.com/">http://www.genealogy.com/cgi-bin/linkcount.cgi?Desc=GENFORUMHISTCHAN&Target=http://www.historychannel.com/</a><br><br></font><font size=-6> <a class="nav" href="http://www.krungkuene.org/~werner/127/index.html">.</a><br><br></font></body></html>
