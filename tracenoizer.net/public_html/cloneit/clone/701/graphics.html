FREE WEB GRAPHICS - TEXT ANIMATIONS All animations on this and the following pages were created by Jon Blackford and are free to use on your website. All I ask is that they are not re-distributed in any form. If you need a particular word or words not already rendered, e-mail me with the style and text, and i'll either e-mail you with the animation, or post them on the site.</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="6"<td valign="bottom"> When you have your text as you want it you can just copy (using ctrl-C). Make sure the Word Art is selected first (by seeing the resize boxes in the corners) I work with Word Art by having the Word Art, 3D, drawing, and shadow toolbars all showing. Then you can go to your graphics program (specifically Paint Shop Pro, or Image Composer - probably also Photoshop but I have no experience with it) and paste it in as a new image, or as a layer for a graphic you maybe already be working on. You can then set the transparency if needed and save as a gif file. This feature in Word has helped me overcome some of the inadequacies of the version of PSP that I use.</td><td valign="top"><img HEIGHT="174" WIDTH="342" src="http://info.med.yale.edu/caim/manual/pages/graphics/graphic_consistency.gif"></td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><td valign="bottom"><img height="172" width="240" src="http://www.webreference.com/graphics/column20/art/fuse1.gif"></td><td valign="bottom"> Create a graphic when the font face and style are unusual or unique and not likely to be installed on the user's system. .
