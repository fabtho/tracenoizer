 Love is the essence of all the teachings and all the doing. Only when I focus on this purpose, to Love, does my Heart sing with joy. The purpose of my life is to Love, to be a spiritual being in human form, so that I understand death is a transformation; life is eternal. I know I can travel in the light, dance with the energy, breathe God's breath, and Love who I truly am. Any painful experience only makes me Love myself and others more deeply.</td>

 " "Parents often place too much emphasis on popularity . Providing the time, space, and transportation for the child to get together with one or two close friends is a far better investment in his or her current and future well being. " Yet to build healthy friendships, your child must first understand the definition of "friend. " "You can help your child define what a true friend should be in several ways," Flynt says. What do they think good friends should do for each other.</td>
