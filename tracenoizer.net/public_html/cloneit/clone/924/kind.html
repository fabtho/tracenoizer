 . I feel bad she has had such a rough life but I don't feel bad for her when she deliberately uses people and lies to get what she wants. I do wish the show had gone on with her having some kind of medical problem, but they skimmed right over that and kept her character a "2 wrongs make a right". I can't wait to see her get what she deserves, and the sooner the better. And her upcoming story with Victor should be good too.</td>

It also enticed us into thinking about making our own travel plans to enjoy all of what you showed us and helped us to understand the potential benefits of seeing our church from that perspective, the incredible context and setting. John and Joyce Everyday I think of you and keep you all in my prayers.</td>
