I can't justify the final couplet if he's not talking about the nature of love "But if this be error, and to me proved,I never writ, nor no man ever loved. " In my mind, Shakespeare's use of the first person narrator is not an indication of a disappointed lover, especially since it doesn't come up until the very end. I think it's just a view on the nature of love and those who love.</td>
