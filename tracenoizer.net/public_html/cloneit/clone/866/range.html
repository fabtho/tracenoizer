 Before 1912, all systems were basically unamplified detectors. As might be expected, by today's standards, the early wireless stations were terribly inefficient. Ships at sea with 5 KW transmitters might get as much as 500 miles maximum range. Experimenters were unorganized and, with the exception of those immediate stations with whom they ran tests, had no knowledge or interest in other pioneer stations. With a temporary truce in effect, equipment was now more readily available to the public.</td>
