If we take part in this we can give a certain definition of these scripts, a certain feel how it is made and how it is transporting ideology. Every language you are forced to use is limiting you. For me it is a bit of a limitation if I speak english, and so if you have to use these programming codes, you have to deal with a certain male conspiracy- structure, I would say. In concete terms a collective sexual persona could be visioned and as follow up be made.">
