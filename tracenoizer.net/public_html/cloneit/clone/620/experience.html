 . The attention to biblical accuracy catapults you back into the life and time of Jesus Christ. You walk the same historical streets, you experience the same wonderful miracles, and you are touched by the power of God as you relive the most important events in the history of mankind. Join the millions who have witnessed the majesty of "JESUS" and whose lives have been changed forever. Filmed entirely on location in Israel, "JESUS" lets you feel a part of history in the making.</td>

The audience was given noisemakers and plastic guns, and were given the responsibility to keep the 30 presenters within their 5 minute time frame. It was a rapid fire presentation, full of dense technical terms, presenting only the newest developments of each online or research facility.</td>
