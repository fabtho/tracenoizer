A variety of different design methodologies have arisen from these research efforts, and numerous visual programming systems have been developed to address both specific application areas, such as user interface design and physical simulation, and more general programming tasks. We present a survey of the field of visual programming languages beginning with an historical overview of some of the pioneering efforts in the field. In addition, we present different classifications of visual programming languages, touch on implementation and design issues, and discuss efforts to formalize the theoretical basis for visual languages.">

 It is hoped that the information shared will include homework and test problems, which will make everyone's life a bit easier. (It may be best not to allow access to solutions from outside your college or university, however. ) This page will not include information about courses aimed at teaching some specific programming language (as a means of teaching programming skills). Also outside the scope of this page will be information about courses in compiler construction. (I'm hoping someone else will volunteer to keep such pages.</td>
