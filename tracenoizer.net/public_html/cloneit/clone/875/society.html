 Each Group concentrates mainly on the records of its former County, but membership is common to all three. Additional material is added to the collection on a regular basis. The Annual General Meeting is held by the Society at Llandrindod Wells usually near the end of September. Three issues are published each year which are free to members. Our members are encouraged to contribute articles and information.</td>
