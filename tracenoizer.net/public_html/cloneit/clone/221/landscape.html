"If you are going to be in the dairy business you have to comply with regulations that protect the environment. The dry manure is sold to landscape contractors for soil amendment and the liquid manure is irrigated onto his cow pastures. The certification, which takes about two years to complete, includes environmental education courses for dairy farmers and third-party evaluations of the farms' manure handling systems. The dairy industry, stunned by the negative publicity when producers were fined for pollution, asked for assistance in developing a program that would set standards so all dairy farmers -- large or small-scale -- could comply with regulations.">

 Its aim is to make a valid contribution to the relationship between man and nature, to the mutual influencing of ecological and aesthetic aspects. In particular, the dialogue with the art of nature, Land Art, has become an important source of inspiration and innovation. The author follows the artistic and theoretical development of the relationship between Land Art and landscape architecture from the 1960s, since the first works of Michael Heizer, Walter de Maria, and others. The main part of the book is devoted to descriptive portraits of twelve internationally known landscape architects and artists who are exploring the wide and varied realm of landscape design - from the classic Scandinavian garden art of Sven-Ingvar Andersson to the avant-garde hyper-realism of Adriaan Geuze, from Dani Karavan's sensitive urban environments to the staging of mystical nature events by Herman Prigann. The designers confront these questions in extensive interviews conducted especially for this book.</td>

 Christophe Girot Department of Architecture Institute for National, Regional and Local Planning Prof. In different aspects they mirror the current state of a profession, which for a long time lay hidden in the realm of the gardening trade until the second half of the 20th century where it began to develop its claim as a design profession in its own right, transferring the concentration from vocational interest to questions of taste and finally to those of an autonomous artistic nature. The publicizing of innovative ideas and concepts through these expositions played an increasingly important role that fundamentally influenced the development of city and landscape planning and design. Garden expositions also left behind lasting traces and monuments, as seen in parts of Zurichs lakeside promenade, or the Bruglinger Area in Basel. The fact that landscape architecture has become the focus of such expositions is by and large a phenomenon of the 20th century.</td>
