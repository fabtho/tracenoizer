 Nauka Kirschner kindly explained to me that the beautiful poster by Gertrud Nolte, selected for an award by the jury, was an AIDS poster, as I could not read it's text nor understand the graphics . . Klaus Staeck, the famous political activist with hundreds of poster exhibitions to his credit, and survivor of countless attempts to bring him to court for them, noted that the interest in political posters has almost completely disappeared in Germany. This surprised me since I had been in Chaumont a few weeks before, where the field seemed to be very active. Maybe the mostly anonymous street fighters just don't care or dare to send in their posters for the competition.</td>
