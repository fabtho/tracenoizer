Some of these posters and lobby cards can no longer be found on the open market but only in the auction houses or in private unadvertised sales. Unless noted, all material is in good or better condition and is original issue and in full color. As many do, I give a broad definition to this category and I include series detectives ( for example, Chan and Moto and Falcon) and some titles that either came before or after the traditional Film Noir time frame (about 1944 to 1959) Since most of these posters and cards are very well known to collectors, I'm included few images on this page. When I have priced all the the separate cards the same, the first buyer will be offered the best card.">
