 Mailers were specially targeted for distribution in low income and minority areas of the district. . Thomas Munsterman Juror Community Awareness Programs (Published Fall, 1995) We know that the experience of being a juror in a well managed court is the best way to let the community know about jury service, but how about all those other people.
