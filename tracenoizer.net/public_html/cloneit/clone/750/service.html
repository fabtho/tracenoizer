 The program actually uses a raw sitelist file which is understood by a perl program (the main code is here; ask me if you really want the whole thing) to generate the index. For the curious, at last count, there were over 6,000 TRs indexed from about 120 different FTP sites. I bothered to do stats on for the month of April, 1994; this service handled 18,275 queries from 4,510 different hosts during the month. I'm honored that this service received an honorable mention for the Best Professional Service in the 1994 Best of the Web Awards. Tips for TR providers wishing to be included in UCSTRI are available; please read them if you know of TRs not indexed here that you would like to be.</td>

 . Pennsylvanians for Modern Courts -- Jury Awareness Campaign Home . Over the next three months, Philadelphians will see jury service posters on SEPTA busses, the Market-Frankford El and the Broad Street Line, depicting a message about the possible negative consequence if everyone does not participate in this civic duty. "The quality of justice dispensed in our courtrooms is largely dependent upon our juries. Juries must be representative of our community and its diversity so that verdicts are the voice of the entire community," said Lynn A.</td>

 Mailers were specially targeted for distribution in low income and minority areas of the district. . Thomas Munsterman Juror Community Awareness Programs (Published Fall, 1995) We know that the experience of being a juror in a well managed court is the best way to let the community know about jury service, but how about all those other people. The Council for Court Excellence, a community supported non-profit court improvement organization in the District of Columbia instituted and developed Jury Service Appreciation Week in 1990. Jury week is recognized by the city and has many attention getting features.</td>
