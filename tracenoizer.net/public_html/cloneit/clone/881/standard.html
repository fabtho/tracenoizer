 Appel, Type-Preserving Garbage Collectors, Daniel C. 28th Annual ACM SIGPLAN -- SIGACT Symposium on Principals of Programming Languages,pp. Postscript (380k) Acrobat (544k) Abstract By combining existing type systems with several standard type-based compilation techniques, we describe how to write strongly typed programs that include a function that acts as a tracing garbage collector for the program. Since the garbage collector is an explicit function, we do not need to provide a trusted garbage collector as a runtime service to manage memory. Since our language is strongly typed, the standard type soundness guarantee "Well typed programs do not go wrong" is extended to include the collector.</td>

 The Fox Project pioneered the development of type-directed compilers. The project is currently investigating both the foundations of type-directed compilation, such as the design of type systems for intermediate and object code, and the engineering problems of implementing type-directed compilers for full-scale programming languages. Our current research artifact is the TILT compiler (Typed Intermediate Languages, Two) for Standard ML. Recent Publications Toward a Practical Type Theory for Recursive Modules. Automated Techniques for Provably Safe Mobile Code.</td>
