 Regardless, the set of public methods declared by the class defines a new type. This new type enjoys all the privileges and benefits of the Java type system in a manner that is completely independent of implementation code. Whether concrete or abstract, a class always defines a single new type. Inheritance via the extends clause also plays another important role that mirrors a class's ability to define a type. Type, or interface, inheritance provides a mechanism for creating subtypes that build on a supertype's public interface.</td>

 It seems simple enough, but many languages completely ignore the needs for financial and time-based data types. I'll discuss some of the new support for data types and arrays later in the article. A single conditional statement can make the SayHi member a debug-only function. I've personally known people who have worked on multiple inheritance for a week, then retired out of frustration to North Carolina to clean hog lagoons. Encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance are preserved without all the pain.</td>
