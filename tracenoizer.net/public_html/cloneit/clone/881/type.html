 then select the type style (or font family member ). . To InDesign, fonts are categorized as font families, and each family is made up of one or more type styles. A font family is a set of typefaces designed to have a common look. A font, then, is specified by its font family and type style.</td>

 we lose the simple intuitive notion of a type as a classifier of collections of values and must replace this notion by a richer but inevitably less intuitive notion of types as classifiers of contexts for evaluation. . Then we can use the term type for a collection of objects that have certain common properties with respect to their behaviour. In other words, whereas a class groups together the objects that have been built in the same way, a type comprises a collection of objects that can be used in the same way. --- America, 1989 A type is a behaviour specification that may be used to generate instances having the behaviour.</td>

Tutorial on Type Analysis Declaration of Typed Objects We here consider a variable declaration as an example for a language construct that defines a typed object. In our language a variable declaration may define several variables. An ObjDecl states the type and the name for each of them.</td>
