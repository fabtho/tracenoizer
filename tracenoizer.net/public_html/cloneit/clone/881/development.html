 Type Inference Mission People Projects Papers Location Pictures College of Computing GVU Center Georgia Tech Type Inference Squeak programmers do not need to worry with formally proving their systems type correct. This allows programmers to develop Squeak artifacts with less sophistication and less effort. However, it also means that Squeak development tools aren't as powerful as their correspondents in statically typed systems. The goal of this project is to develop a practical type inference system for Squeak and thus allow for several useful tools to be derived. Such tools would include raw type annotations, improved error-checking heuristics, more effective compilers, and improved code browsers.</td>

 For programmers who would like to experiment with a type broker or clients of their own, though, we have recently released a preliminary version of the type broker, and a few simple clients. More TOM information Selected papers and presentations on TOM and related subjects. The Digital Library Project at Penn is supporting development of the TOM type broker software for use in digital library preservation and related applications. The TOM Consortium at Carnegie Mellon is developing TOM-based applications, and facilitating transfer of this technology to industry. TinkerTeach group at Carnegie Mellon supported the development of TOM applications at CMU, and has some other interesting resources on composable software.</td>

 It looks almost as if, having failed to corrupt the Java marketplace with proprietary extensions and strategic omissions, Microsoft has simply created a copy of Java, with a new name and a familiar market approach. Motivation for creating a new language A new computer language could be created as part of a research project, to explore new system architectures or new ideas in programming semantics, or to pull together advances from several other language projects to produce a more powerful language. Innovations in computer technology often change basic assumptions about programming and system development, and new languages arise to take advantage of new ideas. Special applications sometimes require new languages, which are tied intimately to the domain in which they operate. Portability between processors is different from portability between underlying operating system APIs.</td>
