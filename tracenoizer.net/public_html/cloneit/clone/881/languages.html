Modern English spoken in Britain, North America and Australia use different words and grammar. If two groups of people speaking the same language are separated, then their languages will change along different paths. First they develop different accents; next some of the vocabulary will change (either due to influences of other languages or by natural processes). When this happens a different dialect is created; the two groups can still understand each other.">
