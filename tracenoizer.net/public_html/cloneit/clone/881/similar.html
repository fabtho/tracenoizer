 . We currently operate a free text search and retrieval service for a substantial portion of the published documents on the WWW. We also sell products that bring this functionality to companies wishing to provide similar facilities for their corporate intranets. Because of our experience at Open Text, a lot of suggestions have been made for improving the current standards (or defacto standards) with an eye towards improving our indexing and search technologies. The following list is a sample of some of the things that Open Text thinks would go a long way in improving the current search and retrieval experience.</td>

 The body must then contain one or more "body parts," each preceded by an encapsulation boundary, and the last one followed by a closing boundary. Each part starts with an encapsulation boundary, and then contains a body part consisting of header area, a blank line, and a body area. Thus a body part is similar to an RFC 822 message in syntax, but different in meaning. A body part is NOT to be interpreted as actually being an RFC 822 message. To begin with, NO header fields are actually required in body parts.</td>
