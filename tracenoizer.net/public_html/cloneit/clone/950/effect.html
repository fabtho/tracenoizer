<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" I find that the pastel medium allows me to develop images with much more depth and detail. The majestic beauty of the Pacific Northwest is indeed the primary inspiration for my work, but often I find myself capturing images that are solely in my imagination. The 225 color pastels I use both allow me to create a spontaneous effect in my designs and yet also control their final outcome by the limited use of colors. This control gives me a boundary to corral and define my creative thought. Working professionally as an artist full-time since 1989, Brett Varney's award winning art has been featured in numerous juried exhibitions and private galleries throughout the Pacific Northwest.">

 Typography These "rules" of typography apply to ALL printed matter, not just posters. Use them if you want to improve the appearance of correspondence, proposals, etc. The "rules" can be broken of course, but only when the design or effect would be enhanced by doing so. Justified text has a conservative, business-like, stuffy feel to it while ragged right text is more easy-going and relaxed. You decide which is best for your poster, based on the kind of effect you're going for.</td>

 At least 10 States were held by force of arms until the proper authorities agreed to vote for this amendment. An excellent overview of this was written by the Utah Supreme Court - 439 Pacific Reporter 2nd Series pgs 266-276, and for a more detailed account of how the 14th amendment was forced upon the Nation see articles in 11 S. Non Freeholders given right to vote, took effect March 30th, 1870. Direct elections of senators; electors; vacancies in the senate, took effect May 31st, 1913. This moved us from a complete Republic to a simple republic much like the style of government of the Soviet Union.</td>
