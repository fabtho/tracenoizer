 Rather than narrowing the range of nominations; the 'language and media' theme actually diversified the scope of candidates, but did tend to privilege typographic work of a strong conceptual basis rather than that with a primarily stylistic or utilitarian nature. Choosing LettError as the recipient of the oeuvre prize Charles Nypels Award 2000 was the jury's recognition that, in addition to the consistent quality, craftsmanship and independence of their typographic innovation; the approach of Just van Rossum and Erik van Blokland is one where language and media are so conceptually united that one might quip that in their work, 'the language is the medium'. LettError does not restrict itself to either the making of typefaces or to the design of typography. Instead of a making-process that works towards a final product, their approach systemically programs a sequence of forms, actions and variable consequences. Instead of making things, they make things that act (often in the service of making other things, which also tend to be active).</td>
