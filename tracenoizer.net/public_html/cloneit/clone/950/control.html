 I find that the pastel medium allows me to develop images with much more depth and detail. The majestic beauty of the Pacific Northwest is indeed the primary inspiration for my work, but often I find myself capturing images that are solely in my imagination. The 225 color pastels I use both allow me to create a spontaneous effect in my designs and yet also control their final outcome by the limited use of colors. This control gives me a boundary to corral and define my creative thought. Working professionally as an artist full-time since 1989, Brett Varney's award winning art has been featured in numerous juried exhibitions and private galleries throughout the Pacific Northwest.</td>

 GEC is almost ideal for IPACS because GEC needs a large momentum vector (for a momentum bias ACS design) and an efficient power system. One of the putative advantages of an IPACS design is that its overall efficiency can be better than a battery. How to minimize, and control, the CP and CG locations provide one of the major trades for the spacecraft design. AE-C succeeded in holding the CP-CG offset to less than 0. 1 inches but AE-C did not have the large electric field booms envisioned for GEC.</td>
