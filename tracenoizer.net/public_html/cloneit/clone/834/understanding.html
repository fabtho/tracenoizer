But if you don't have this I think as a very technical programmer that you have a big problem with the artist to have something which lives and grows and where the programmer is more like someone who is only doing the work which the artist says without giving any input. .</td>

 We took a parenting class and so much in the class that we leaned I was already familiar with because of this book. I didn't freak out about certain things because I knew what to expect. This book helped me understand the different phases my wife would go through and it allowed me to have a more understanding and patience with things. The delivery was a snap because of what this book prepared me for, along with class. This book is well worth it and I highly recommend it.</td>
