The first chart shows everything from how newborns communicate to when you can expect your baby to take their first steps. The Toddler chart spans the time from 15 months to 5 years and discloses when your child will enjoy rhyming games or when they will start to name everyday objects. Many of the sections in this book are very thoughtful and encourage a dad to consider the child in his life and make this new life a high priority. This book is also filled with humor guys will really relate to.">
