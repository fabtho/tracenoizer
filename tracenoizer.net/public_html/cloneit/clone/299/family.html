 This is a clearinghouse for GIDEON information with listings of associated surnames, queries on GIDEON related families and information and a place to find our other relatives. My Personal Gideon Lines My line of GIDEON goes back to Peter GIDEON, a Revolutionary War Soldier who was most likely born in Germany, though his Revolutionary War papers say "somewhere near Philadelphia" as his place of origin. Family lore indicates he may have been born onboard the ship on the way to the U. IIf your browser is java-capable, you can chat with other GIDEON and related surname researchers right here on site. Should anyone be abusing the room during unorganized chats, please email me and I will make the room "password only" users.</td>
