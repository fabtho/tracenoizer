 These leaflets also include a weekly overview of the feature programmes and the frequencies of all foreign language broadcasts to that target aera. . My question was if 'BBC Worldwide' - the monthly magazine of the World Service was the only way to get the frequencies used. The subscription of this magazine costs 24 pounds per year and is - in my eyes - too expensive for those people who only want to find out a useful frequency. The answer was that there are leaflets available free of charge that are published twice a year (the next edition covers the period from October to March).</td>
