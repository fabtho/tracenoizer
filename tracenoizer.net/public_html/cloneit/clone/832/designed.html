 The design itself is very pleasing to the eye and harmonious to your way of life. Ceilings can sore to 28 feet or more in our larger domes. EXPANDABLE The dome can be designed with literally hundreds of different floor plans to suit every need for you and your family. You can start with a small to medium sized dome and add others in a cluster arrangement as your family grows or your needs change. The additional dome or domes can be added to any opening area you wish, with just a little forethought during the design phase.</td>

 When he was 32, Buckminster Fuller's life seemed hopeless. He was grief stricken over the death of his first child and he had a wife and a newborn to support. Although he never obtained a degree in architecture, he was an architect and engineer who designed revolutionary structures. His famous Dymaxion House was a pre-fabricated, pole-supported dwelling. His Dymaxion car was a streamlined, three-wheeled vehicle with the engine in the rear.</td>

 Born cross-eyed, he was a belligerent youngster, twice kicked out of Harvard. The metal structure hung from a central mast with outer walls of continuous glass, affording maximum design efficiency with minimal materials. Fuller next designed the Dymaxion Car, a sensation when it was demonstrated on city streets and at the Chicago World's Fair in 1933. Because the strange-looking streamlined car rode on three wheels, seated 11 passengers, and got a remarkable 30 miles to the gallon, it promised to revolutionize the auto industry -- until a tragic accident ultimately derailed those plans. The post-war housing shortage strengthened Fuller's resolve to devise affordable housing for everyone.</td>
