 Josef Hasslberger An excellent collection of resources relating to Buckminster Fuller's conceptual worldview, including applications in physics, economics and free energy. . But perhaps the world would really be a far more utopian place to live if they had instead focused their energies on implementing the immensely practical ideas of Richard Buckminster Fuller. In 1927 Fuller designed the factory-assembled Dymaxion house (making cheap mass-produced housing a reality), followed in 1928 by the three-wheeled Dymaxion car (technically superior and safer than the Model T Ford). But Fuller's designs encountered resistance from purely profit-driven corporations, whose destructive legacies he would spend the next fifty years fighting.</td>
