 References can, with difficulty, be pointed out and explained to a foreign reader. But it is a rare rhyme or pun that translates well. So if you want to appreciate in translation everything that is going on in the original, the explanation of the couplets will be significantly longer than the couplets themselves. Which is not a good way to convey the music, so to speak, of a good couplet. You read the translation with your left hand, and the notes with your right.</td>

There were soon far too many artefacts for the museum to house, and many were sent up to the Museum of Archaeology in Istanbul.</td>
