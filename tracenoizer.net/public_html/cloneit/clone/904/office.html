 California State University, Fullerton California State University, Fullerton (CSUF) is an urban campus centrally located in northern Orange County and one of the 23 campuses of the California State University system. The Fall 1999 CSUF full-time enrollment exceeded 26,000 students. Of this number, approximately 600 registered with the Office of Disabled Student Services. The adaptive technology program at CSUF began in the late 1980s with a collaborative effort between four departments of the university. At that time, the program was developed around a segregated model where all the adaptive technology was located in a single facility and students who needed to use adaptive technologies to access computers had to go to that lab to do their work.</td>
