 Each programme consists of relatively fixed curricula, which are clearly spread over several academic years. . Depending on the study programme, it consists of two 2-year cycles (the case with most university degree courses), or one 2-year cycle plus one 3-year cycle (most engineering courses) or one 3-year cycle plus one 4-year cycle (courses leading to the qualification of medical doctor). Upon completion of the first cycle successful students are entitled to an intermediate degree called the 'kandidaat'. Students must have a diploma of secondary education to gain admission to this first cycle.</td>
