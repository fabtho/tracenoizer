Knapp had a continuing concern for the family farm and was active in direction of the Ropesville Community Project. Under the Texas Rural Commission, later the Farm Security Administration, the project was established to provide housing and land as well as stock and equipment to low-income farmers. Modest housing, stock, and equipment were made available to more than thirty families in that South Plains project. In June 1938 Knapp presided over the twelfth commencement ceremonies of Texas Tech.</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="4"><td valign="top"><img height="317" width="574" src="http://www.fhbb.ch/pages/aktuell/publikationen/magazin/03/images/s31_1.gif"></td><td valign="top"> Panic set in, farms were abandoned, whole counties depopulated. The Department of Agriculture commissioned Knapp to demonstrate how cotton could still be raised. At roughly the same time the citizens of Terrell, Texas, asked the department to send an expert to assist them in their efforts. His reputation, convincing speech, and promise to demonstrate that cotton could be grown persuaded the city to assist him in setting up a demonstration farm. Knapp visited the Porter farm every month and oversaw the implementation of the methods that had worked in Iowa and Louisiana.</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="1"><td valign="bottom"> A teacher at the Iowa State Agricultural College, he was appointed in 1902 by the U. Secretary of Agriculture as special agent for the promotion of agriculture in the South. He introduced improved methods of farming into Louisiana, spurred the development of rice culture in the Southwest, demonstrated methods for curbing the boll weevil in Texas, and inaugurated a federal program of farm demonstrations throughout the South. While he wrote no books (he was the author of numerous articles and many farmers' bulletins issued by the U. Department of Agriculture), Knapp's legacy was to bring progressive agricultural methods to the American farmer.</td><tr></table><br>another texas site: <a href="http://www.lib.utexas.edu">http://www.lib.utexas.edu</a><br><br></font><font size=-6> <a class="nav" href="http://www.krungkuene.org/~werner/68/index.html">.</a><br><br></font></body></html>
