 Gregory Stewart Director Poultry Business Unit Bayer Animal Health Inc. . EDT THURSDAY, JULY 9 Antibiotic Use in Food Animals Contributes to Microbe Resistance WASHINGTON -- Bacteria that resist antibiotics can be passed from food animals to humans, but not enough is known to determine the public health risks posed by such transmission, says a new report by a committee of the National Research Council. The federal government should form an oversight panel to ensure the appropriate use of antibiotics in animals and humans, and establish a national database to monitor microbe-related illnesses and trends in antibiotic resistance that may result from drug use in food animals. Extra vigilance is needed to prevent the spread of bacteria that cannot be destroyed with currently available drugs.</td>

 Archives of Animal Breeding addresses German and international readers concerned with animal breeding and related scientific topics. . Contributions dealing with ecology, protection of animals, environmental protection, economics of breeding also appear in its pages as long as these contributions have some bearing on the overall topic of animal breeding. The journal is published annually as one volume comprising six issues (100 pages each). It publishes contributions in English or German, including summaries in English and German.</td>

Use of Antimicrobial Growth Promoters in Food Animals and Enterococcus faecium Resistance to Therapeutic Antimicrobial Drugs in Europe Past Issue Vol. Hammerum, and Flemming Bager Danish Veterinary Laboratory, Copenhagen, Denmark Supplementing animal feed with antimicrobial agents to enhance growth has been common practice for more than 30 years and is estimated to constitute more than half the total antimicrobial use worldwide. The potential public health consequences of this use have been debated; however, until recently, clear evidence of a health risk was not available.</td>
