In response to this issue, the Minister for Health and Aged Care and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, jointly established a Joint Expert Technical Advisory Committee on Antibiotic Resistance (JETACAR) in 1998. JETACAR comprised experts from the areas of human health, veterinary medicine and primary industry. It was tasked with assessing the scientific evidence of a link between the use of antibiotics in food-producing animals, the emergence and selection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and their spread to humans, and to recommend future risk management strategies.">

 Offers a guide and reference to the theory and practice of breeding and infertility investigation across a range of species. 1, November 1995 This new book in Blackwell's Veterinary Health Series provides up-to-date source of information on reproduction and infertility of farm livestock and horses, taking a practical, problem-orientated approach. It should be of particular interest to veterinarians, animal scientists working in the field of reproduction, and students of veterinary medicine and agriculture. The opening chapter, which is entitled "Genetic considerations in animal breeding",. GENETIC CONSIDERATIONS IN ANIMAL BREEDING by Heather G.</td>

 The heightened awareness of the environmental impacts associated with animal production has caused animal nutritionists to refocus their thoughts, practices, and expectations regarding how nutrients are supplied to animals. In addition, the increase in the size and intensity of modern production units demands new technologies for enhancing nutrient utilization and for reducing the amount of nutrients excreted. Features Discusses environmental challenges faced by livestock and poultry industries (presented by industry leaders and consultants) Presents an overview of the environmental impact of modern livestock and poultry production Covers technologies for improved nutrient utilization and reduced excretion Includes new feeding strategies to reduce environmental pollution Explores ideas for future research and development Audience Animal and poultry scientists Agricultural industry personnel Professional societies and their members (American Society of Animal Science; American Dairy Association; Poultry Science Association; AFIA Nutrition Council; Soil Science of America) EPA and environmental quality programs within state agencies Private practitioners Government and university researchers Contents Environmental Challenges as Related to Animal Agriculture Beef K.
