 Schweizer, DVM, Diplomate ACT This authoritative yet straightforward guide discusses the preparations required -- and the challenges -- of getting mares pregnant. Schweizer covers such topics as the mare's anatomy, the reproductive system, and the importance of teasing and veterinary monitoring. The Cornell University instructor also examines the different breeding methods, including artificial insemination. Schweizer discusses ways to optimize the chances of conception through various management techniques and how to deal with infertility. Anyone who owns a mare will benefit from this important book.</td>

 .Our presence in Philadelphia, a metropolis with millions of people - and their millions of animals - means we never lack patients. Our small animal hospital, in the heart of the University City section of Philadelphia, draws an enormous caseload of varied small species. And our pastoral New Bolton Center attracts a large number of assorted large animals. The huge biomedical research complex that comprises the University of Pennsylvania greatly enhances student learning and their opportunity to participate in cutting-edge research.</td>
