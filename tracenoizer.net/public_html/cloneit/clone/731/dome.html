 . Baldwin Click the yellow arrows above to see other inventions. Thus, any dome that is a portion of a sphere has the least surface through which to lose heat or intercept potentially damaging winds. A geodesic dome uses a pattern of self-bracing triangles in a pattern that gives maximum structural advantage, thus theoretically using the least material possible. ) Click the pictures above to examine patent drawings.</td>
