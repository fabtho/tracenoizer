 . It serves to construct beyond itself that inaccessible past of societies at which historians take aim. The first question to be asked is, Why do we need to suggest, at a scientific and an academic level, "new approaches" to the history of the cinema. The cinema appeared very early on as worthy of being instituted as an object of knowledge -- as early as May 1897, the first history of the new invention appeared.

 The first edition featured four films and attracted 700 viewers. The Third World Film Festival was officially recognized by the Ministry of Development Aid and received financial support from the Flemish Community, the province of West Flanders and the Brugge town council. The expansion of the festival and the ensuing financial implications, all the specific aspects inherent to the organization of a film event and the growing experience in the cinema environment led to the setting up of a separate and autonomous organization, the Third Film. The core of the original statement of intent remained unchanged, but a few aspects which are typical of film events were added. The feature films from the developing countries were shown in a wider context.</td>
