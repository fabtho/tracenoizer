The video features an eccentric professor who travels across England and South Wales from Greenwich to Cardiff using various land marks and towns to represent the planets' distance from the sun all to the same scale as a globe of the earth that he carries with him.

 We invite you to join our happy band of movie makers and come along to any of our advertised club evenings completely without obligation and EXPLORE THE WORLD OF AMATEUR MOVIE MAKING. . Though at first being fairly inexperienced in this field we have attracted new members and can now boast a video projector allowing us to show films and videos on the same size screen. The society is keen to expand its membership and encourage the making of both cine and video movies. We would hope to create an environment in which the inexperienced as well as the more practised can show movies that even a complete stranger would find entertaining.</td>

 The filmmakers followed the Harriers on seven different runs, which not only serve as exercise but also as a social event. Along the running trail, the runners stop at stations that have beer, and at the end of the run there is a party. Michael Krapf (senior-film and video communications), director and producer of On-On, said CAN is a great opportunity for filmmakers to gain exposure. After CAN is free, and will include some of the films that were not featured in the CAN Film Festival. The festival is sponsored by SFO, University Park Allocations Committee and The Revolution 101.</td>
