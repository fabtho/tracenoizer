 Weber earned her bachelor's from Fontbonne in 1999 and will be one of the nearly 150 students receiving a master of social work degree from Washington University Friday, May 19. During her two years here, she has gained firsthand experience through two practicum field projects with St. In early 1999, she spent six months working as part of an interdisciplinary health care team at Deaconess Hospital (now known as Forest Park Hospital). As a social worker, her contribution involved assessing the needs of cancer patients and their families, providing emotional support and arranging nursing assistance or hospice placement as necessary. Since August 1999, she has interned with American Heartland Hospice, where she provided similar counseling services to older adults in their final months, weeks and days of life.</td>
