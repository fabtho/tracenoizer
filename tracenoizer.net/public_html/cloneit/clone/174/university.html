 She is the chair of the Steering Committee for the NCI-sponsored Cancer Genetics Network, a consortium of eight cancer genetics centers selected by competitive application, and she is a member of the Steering Committee of the International Breast Cancer Linkage Consortium. . Weber, an international leader in the field of breast cancer genetics, is a Professor of Medicine and Genetics at the University of Pennsylvania. She developed the Breast Cancer Program at the University of Pennsylvania Cancer Center in 1995 and has served as the director since that time. In this capacity, she implemented and directs the Breast Cancer Risk Evaluation Program, a clinical service designed to provide comprehensive risk assessment and counseling services to women concerned about their risk of developing breast cancer, with a special focus on women with a strong family history of breast cancer.</td>

Weber, University of Pennsylvania When a team led by University of Utah geneticist Mark Skolnick announced the discovery of a breast-cancer susceptibility gene (Y. But three of the competing teams that were chasing after the same gene made their mark by publishing papers that confirmed the Skolnick squad's result. In addition to verifying its link to breast or ovarian cancer, or both, the Nature Genetics papers discussed the difficulty in developing a reliable screening test because the gene can mutate in so many ways.</td>
