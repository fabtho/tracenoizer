 Zahn continued work towards a doctorate at the University of Illinois' Champaign-Urbana campus, earning an M. In 1975 Zahn also began writing science fiction as a hobby. In December of 1978 he sold his first story, "Ernie," to Analog while still working towards an eventual career in physics. Zahn sold his second story, "The Dreamsender," (also to Analog) in mid-1979, on the same day that his thesis advisor died. Taking on a new thesis advisor and a new project, Zahn resumed work towards his doctorate essentially from scratch.</td>

Poems I haven't really started yet, I'm going to make a letter to send to lots of dance studios. I am debating, at the moment, whether or not to get a PO box or if I'll get enough entries so that I'll need one.</td>
