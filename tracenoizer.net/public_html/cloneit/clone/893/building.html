 It is being published here so that members of the Duke community and others may obtain information about the library's goals and may provide input and feedback to shape further planning. Provost Peter Lange appointed the renovation committee in August 2000, charging it to think creatively about the nature of library services and facilities at Duke over the next fifteen to twenty years and make recommendations regarding the design and function of Perkins Library. The committee is working with Duke faculty, students, and staff to develop a vision for renovating and reinvigorating Perkins and with architectural consultants to translate this vision into a building program. More information, including opportunities to participate in the planning process, can be found at the committee website. Spanning over 200 years, these books provide a window into the lives and aspirations of all classes of American women.</td>
