 Well that seems to be his prime target, but this track shows he can whip out a pretty darn good techno track in the between time. Here again, an old track but all that separates it from modern techno tracks is more channels and more and bigger samples -- the composition is solid techno and includes some interesting accents such as acid blurps, spacey synths and some use of that old familiar disco string rise (you'll recognize it). 1993 mansoojRight up front I have to admit that being a big Jarre fan, instead of being overly critical of 'jarresque' tunes, I find it hard not to like them, assuming they're done well.

 Not only does he continue to play a regular shift on the first line as he did last year, Kunz also plays on the power play and penalty-killing units. At 5-foot-11 and 185 pounds, Kunz is not the biggest guy on the team, but he is willing to play a physical game and mix it up. He has a good attendance record at practices and works hard every time he is there, and Kunz is not afraid to play hurt. Because of the way Kunz plays, he has become a team leader. He started out as a mite and worked his way up through the ranks of youth hockey.</td>
