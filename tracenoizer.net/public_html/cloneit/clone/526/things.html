 Back in the 50's, blacks were segregated from whites. Then we decided that it was bad to discriminate, so we included all races. Things like minority scholarships, black history month, and the Black Entertainment Television Network, Inc. are just a few of the many examples of blacks doing exactly what they didn't want to happen to them back in the 50's. Warren says that women should have comparable pay for comparable work.</td>

 This early civilization in particular is one of the ones who had many of their traditions, scriptures and lore 'lifted' and moulded into other religions beliefs, and is the cornerstone in many revisionist's theories that the Bible and the Tora (sp. ) and other religious documents were misinterpreted and alot of current religious customs are therefore adhereing to flawed 'rules' (like chastity, monotheism etc. There are things all over the place, both net based and books, about religious Dogma and the origins of the Faith. Damn that was a long thing about religion from an Athiest. it's only an island if you look at it from the water.</td>
