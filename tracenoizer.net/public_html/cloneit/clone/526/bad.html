 Apple is on the verge of releasing a new brand new OS and the market is saturated with old hardware. Once MacOSX is released everything will turn around. I admit the cube was a bad idea, but at least it's not like in the dark ages when you had a choice of the beige mac or the other beige mac. These are great times and when you all look back you will be proud to have been here to see it all. I wish everyone would just relax and give Apple a break.</td>

 And now I have to figure out how to do dial-up if I need to (to work, for instance) and how to get the work network to see my cable access. wonder if he'd be up for a Scripting News dinner in San Diego. Too bad he's not staying through Thursday (or is he. ) or I'd have him sit in on the Live show and we'd talk about whatever he wanted to. Well, after dad jumped in first to provide water-side support, that is.</td>
