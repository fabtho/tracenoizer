 Berlin International Film Festival 2000 - 50th Berlinale Berlin International Film Festival . And there was Denzel Washington who took Best Actor for his role in The Hurricane and expressed his emotion over the standing ovation the film received after its screening. Not forgetting Jeanne Moreau, who mingled with Chancelor Shroeder, the young shooting stars, and received a Golden Bear for Lifetime Achievement. Potsdamer Platz, a newly constructed Metroplis, was the site of the Berlinale Palast where the 21 films in competition were screened. Headed by Moritz de Hadeln for the past 21 years, the 12-day event was not marked by any extreme reactions one way or another - excepting the predictable Leomania.</td>

 " That Von Trier-Vinterberg charter that gave us Idiots and The Celebration at Cannes -- proclaiming the virtues of a plain style with no artificial lighting, sets, or even camera tripods -- is now threatening to colonize the world. Next up are French- and American-directed Dogma flicks, the latter from Paul Morrissey. Denmark's Golden Bear contender was a whirry comedy with a rough, apache charm. In Mifune, writer-director Soren Kragh-Jacobsen sends a freshly wedded youngster (Iben Hjejle) into the country to tidy up after his pa's death. Once there he goes native, bonding with a retarded brother, a housekeeper-cum-call-girl, and a lot of wild scenery.</td>
