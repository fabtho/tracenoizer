<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" Ironically, this wide variety of choice is one impediment to the significant benefits promised by software reuse. The emergence of the Unified Modeling Language (UML)-created by the joint efforts of leading object technologists Grady Booch, Ivar Jacobson, and James Rumbaugh with contributions from many others in the object community-represents one of the most significant developments in object technology. Included is a brief explanation of UML's history, development, and rationale, as well as discussions on how UML can be integrated into the object-oriented development process. In addition, the authors offer the first look at the emerging Objectory Software Development Process derived from the methodologies of Grady Booch, Ivar Jacobson, and James Rumbaugh. To give you a feel for the UML in action, the book includes a Java programming example that outlines the implementation of a UML-based design.">

 . Those demands where collected during two users group meetings held at the Maryland State Board of Elections for which a summary is available. The changes discussed address the AutoFill capability of the software and the receipt entry process. If a matching record is selected, all additional common data should be loaded without keying. If the record is a receipt, the amount of this transaction should be added to the previous aggregate and the new total displayed without any additional actions by the user.</td>

 If the pages on one side or the other are invalid, this will induce a page fault, and the page fault handler will do the appropriate thing (either invoke segment keeper on sender side or truncate the transfer on receiver side). The catch is that sender A can get halfway through, page fault, and then sender B can get in while sender A is producing the page. Note that no new process states are introduced -- an interrupted transfer is restarted from the beginning. By eliminating the operations that return data, the page key can be implemented as one of the "simple case" capabilities. A few operations that currently can be managed with data registers retain string versions for historical reasons.</td>

 The ideas were primarily contributed by Phil Koopman (UTRC), Dan Siewiorek (CMU), and Tilt Thompkins (UTRC). This is an essay rather than a scholarly paper; no references are provided. We propose an augmented model of design that couples behavior and structure in a way that supports a variety of strategies for making the design process efficiently responsive to change. This model is based on hierarchically layered pairs of behavior and structure that represent successively higher levels of design abstraction. Contents Introduction Model of Design Abstraction Design Process Dynamics Design for Change Conclusions Introduction Previous work at EDRC has focussed largely on the design synthesis cycle.</td>
