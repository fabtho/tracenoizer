 . Ironically, this wide variety of choice is one impediment to the significant benefits promised by software reuse. The emergence of the Unified Modeling Language (UML)-created by the joint efforts of leading object technologists Grady Booch, Ivar Jacobson, and James Rumbaugh with contributions from many others in the object community-represents one of the most significant developments in object technology. Included is a brief explanation of UML's history, development, and rationale, as well as discussions on how UML can be integrated into the object-oriented development process. In addition, the authors offer the first look at the emerging Objectory Software Development Process derived from the methodologies of Grady Booch, Ivar Jacobson, and James Rumbaugh.</td>

 From another perspective, the advanced implementation techniques incorporated in Vortex can enable a more flexible, expressive programming style to be followed. . Our current research strives to achieve excellent performance for large, heavily object-oriented programs. We are targeting whole-program analysis and optimization, enlarging the scope of analysis and optimization to the interprocedural level, potentially to include the entire program being implemented. These techniques are embodied in the Vortex optimizing compiler infrastructure.</td>
