 After several months of working together, the teacher is reevaluated. . The California Teachers Association adopted a new policy in October 1998 that will allow members to participate in peer review programs. Although CTA supported peer assistance programs in the past, this marks a new direction for the Association. CTA guidelines specify that where peer review programs exist, they may not be mandatory, and they must operate in conjunction with a peer assistance program.</td>

 The best time to request a peer review consultation is when a concern regarding a physicians care has been identified, but no formal actions have been taken, as the consultation is consultative and educational - not a formal part of a disciplinary proceeding. . Physician consultants, who are members of CMA and CALS surveyors, provide objective peer review of the work of a member of a hospital's medical staff. The intent is to help facilitate, but not substitute for, the formal medical staff peer review process which is mandated by California law, Title 22 and JCAHO. This program is valuable to physicians and medical staffs who identify a need for a peer review by an outside, objective party.</td>
