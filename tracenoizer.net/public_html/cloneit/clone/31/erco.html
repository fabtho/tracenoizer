 Contemporary architecture increasingly confronts lighting designers with rooms, foyers, and halls with unusual dimensions. Increasingly, it is becoming clear that existing fixture models are at the limits of their performance. The design and photometric details of the new spotlight series are based on the experience acquired by ERCO in the lighting of the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao.

 And yet, here and there you do find a trend which challenges mass-media guru Marshall McLuhan's prediction that the world will eventually become a global village. One interesting recent example shows that Italian and German design are still distinctively different. Michele De Lucchi's "Tolomeo" lamp for Artemide is as unquestionably "Italian" as its German sister, the "Lucy" lamp which Francesco Clivio designed for Erco in 1995, is "German". "Lucy" is a mirror image of "Tolomeo", and vice versa, which makes both an object lesson in design with a national identity. "Lucy", Franco Clivio for Erco "Tolomeo", Michele De Lucchi for Artemide "Juli", Werner Aisslinger for Cappelini.</td>
