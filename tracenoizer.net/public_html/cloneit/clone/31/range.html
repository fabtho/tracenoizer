 Ettore Sottsass was the best loved of all with his coloured plastic laminate panels for Abet Laminati, among the most popular creations of the Memphis era, whose "violently" decorated surfaces graced many a German furnishing product. However, young German designers quickly opposed the colourful Italian trend with their own austerely unexuberant plain MDF and untreated metal furnishings. Today both Germany and Italy offer a range of different design trends, as the understated elegance of new modesty and the back-to-nature philosphy of ecological design develop in parallel with bright colours, pale wood and new man-made materials. Who can now tell the difference between German and Italian design. When Antonio Citterio and Mario Bellini design furniture for Vitra, Matteo Thun designs a coffee pot for WMF and Michele De Lucchi is commissioned by Interluebke, it hardly seems appropriate to speak of German design.</td>
