 This is a scan of a completed bag with a bookcover packaged and ready to go. . Greenwood This design was a product bag for a stretchy fabric bookcover. Once the layout and coloring were finished, the design was then color seperated and sent to a printer who was able to print the design on clear plastic bags. Color seperations are done by masking off each color into a seperate design.</td>
