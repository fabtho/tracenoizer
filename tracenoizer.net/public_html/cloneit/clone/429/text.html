I think, there is no doubt that external systems are far superior to ZCatalog for some applications.

I did not even think one moment that ZCatalog might be able to manage such an amount of data efficiently. Well, ZCatalog is free and the system we use for this application costs about 100,000 USD.</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="1"<td valign="top"> At Checkout, you may 1) use our Secure Commerce Server to securely transmit your payment information OR 2) prepare your order for offline printing so you may FAX or MAIL it to us.
