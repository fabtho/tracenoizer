 Die Gewinner von heute werden die Verlierer von morgen sein city. Mit Texten von Avtar Brah, Yvonne Volkart, Interviews mit Bertha Jottar und Rosi Braidotti, Videoskrips und kollektiven Kulturproduktionen. The theoretical texts and art projects in this book encompass a range of positions and strategies developed in the postcolonial context of particular cultural sites. The publication presents a cultural practice that focuses on gender in cross-border and migration movements and in the geographic context of post-urban zones such as the ones that have developed along the U. At the same time, these projects pursue a continuing interest in gender and minority representations in the media and in the signifying systems of art and ethnography.</td>
