 after all, the question was where the Sartres, the de Beauvoirs and the Camus' of the digital age are. this is not about empty 15-minute media-stardom, but about people who are able to reflect about the present in a political and historical perspective and who are able to communicate (write. ) their thoughts in a way that makes it possible for others to follow these insights, have new and other ones, construct new political strategies, people who can conduct or participate in a political debate and who will not be afraid to have an influence on the course of history. the captains of industry rarely have any doubts about that, intellectuals mostly do. to give the position of the 'organic intellectual' (Antonio Gramsci) up for the sake of late-anti-authoritarian Kinderladen flatness which only serves to weaken the little political weight that critical media circles might have, seems silly to me.</td>

 In this second conference we plan to present a series of public programs which will consider many aspects of the way in which the new technologies affect women specifically, and to discover what strategies and techniques women are developing to meet these new conditions. . Increasinly,globalized society is being territorialized by western aesthetic and market strategies and cultural formations. Many "alternative" subversive strategies have been harnessed by pancapitalism to capture new markets and consumers everywhere. This situation acts as a rallying cry for a _New_ cyberfeminism for the 21st century.</td>
