 So what did you take from Natalie's work and teaching. the most recurring phrase that comes back to me as I am working on this project and technowork in general (be it devices or the internet), is a phrase that I got from an essay of hers you published on RHIZOME.

 So what did you take from Natalie's work and teaching. the most recurring phrase that comes back to me as I am working on this project and technowork in general (be it devices or the internet), is a phrase that I got from an essay of hers you published on RHIZOME. That said, technologies can therefore be used to make social relations tangible. It has become one of the standards I use to evaluate my output. I was curious as to what that meant when I read it.</td>

 there is an instability at the very heart of sex and bodies, the fact that the body is what it is capable of doing, and what any body is capable of doing is well beyond the tolerance of any given culture. How do we describe these strange new bodies, these body doubles of virtuality and flesh. What are the effects of the biotech revolution on social constructions of gender, and on women. We need to examine the increasingly close links between medical and military technologies and the implications of these for women. Cyberfeminism can perhaps best be described as a feminist intervention into these new conditions, and an exploration of how they challenge the political and social conditions of feminism.</td>

 However these people are specialists with regard to the current debate on future work models, where the idea of full-time employment is a thing of the past and where individuals manage themselves. With their freelance and Mac jobs and their temporary contracts they represent a model for flexible work conditions based on economic deregulation, growing unemployment, the revival of liberal exchange and the accelerated spread of new technologies. Despite the fact that these technologies are used as the misguided solutions to a clapped-out economy in need of social solutions, they are employed by the freelancers on various levels regardless. "Brave New Work" deals with the contraversial debate around globalisation, a term in itself that provokes both excitement and a sense of foreboding. Given that culture workers are themselves a part of this globalisation, that they contribute in a significant way to its existence, this year's congress first takes a look at their deregulation possibilities.</td>
