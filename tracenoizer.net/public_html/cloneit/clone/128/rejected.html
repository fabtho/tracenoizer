 This article gave the theory its first wide visibility. Based on a version of the theory developed independently by Blaine Elswood, it was investigated and reported on by Tom Curtis. The editor of the Journal of Medical Ethics summarises Pascal's argument, explains why JME rejected it, and notes its importance and availability. This is a reply to Tom Curtis's article in Rolling Stone and is one of the few published critiques of the theory. Stimulated by Curtis's article in Rolling Stone, the Wistar Institute set up an independent committee to examine the theory.</td>
