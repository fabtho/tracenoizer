Ace cuttings, poker demonstrations, plus Martin's presentation of a Lorayne routine and a Daley quickie. Nash's version of Twisting the Aces is a very powerful effect and includes the revelation of a selected card. The finale, Jacks Are Better, is a series of sandwich effects, each one more incredible than the last. Nash has never explained to anyone, not even to Stephen Minch, the author of the Nash card books.">
