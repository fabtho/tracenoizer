 This statement does not show that the corporation would show profits to offset his losses. There was no hard or fast evidence to suggest that there was a reasonable expectation of profit within a reasonable period of time. That was not relevant to whether or not there was a reasonable expectation of profit in his magician business. That was a private enterprise and it is separate and apart from the business in issue. Different assets were used in the two businesses and the income in one cannot offset a loss in the other.</td>

 As a matter of fact, at one time Hans and I were working on some kind of international video rental scheme, working out a system where people could rent the videos, rather than buy them. But ultimately, it was decided that whatever financial return could be realized from it was certainly not in line with the amount of work it would have taken to have done it. At one time, as you said, the only place that you saw or heard about a magician was reading a write-up about him in a magazine, or the odd appearance on t. That was the only place you could see them, so if you were booking a convention and got a magician who was written up but rarely seen, he would draw. I remember when Jeff McBride was just starting out we were able to book him for Magie Montreal in 1981 and he drew like wildfire.</td>

 Now McBride shares with the magic world, for the first time, many never before disclosed techniques of the master manipulators.

Named Magician of the Year by The Magic Castle in Los Angeles, McBride is recognized as a foremost innovator in contemporary magic. Volume I shows McBride performing magic for an intimate audience.
