 In any event, up to 1989 there would have been 17 years in business and each year was predicated on a loss. In this type of business it would be completely ridiculous to expect that you could wait that long to make a profit. The best that the Appellant could argue was that hopefully, in the future, he would draw a salary from the Videonics company to offset his losses. This statement does not show that the corporation would show profits to offset his losses. There was no hard or fast evidence to suggest that there was a reasonable expectation of profit within a reasonable period of time.</td>

 00 (VD0248) EARLY AMMAR (4 VOLUME SET) In 1979, Hans Zahn, fron Newfoundland, Canada had a vision. Home video recorders were still new, but realizing video was perfect for teaching magic, he formed magic's first video company-Videonics. The result is a fascinating, first ever recording of a future star of magic. Those familiar with Michael Ammar's current video projects will hardly recognize this young west Virginian, with his college haircut and his slow, laid back drawl. But you'll recognize his love for magic as he reveals the depth of thinking behind these beautifully constructed routines.</td>
