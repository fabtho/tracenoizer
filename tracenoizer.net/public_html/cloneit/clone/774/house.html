<meta name="Description" lang="al "content=" The book always takes the easy way out, if it is available. For example, the section on Living at Home after college talks about volunteering for the easiest, fastest-to-be-done chores (taking out the trash ranks first) so you can continue to take advantage of dear old Mom and Dad. The first four chapters focus on issues like how to keep a relationship with your old college steady after one of you moves way, moving back into your parents' house, getting a place to live on your own, or starting to date people who aren't in college. In evaluating each of these areas, the primary perspective is how to get the most out of your social relations. Clearly, this is just a stop gap between social engagements.">
