 The closed network It is obvious that Real Time Ethernet is only possible when there is a closed system which can not be accessed by external buses. This may be guaranteed by using gateways between the Local Area Network and the Real Time Network or by using switches. Experience shows that talking about Real Time in general and for a specific application is very different. Today Ethernet is mainly used for networks on the controller and plant level. Therefore each station within the network has its own processor and program.</td>
