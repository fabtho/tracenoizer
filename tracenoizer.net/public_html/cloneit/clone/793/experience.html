 students design payload BY CARLOS SANTOSTIMES-DISPATCH STAFF WRITER Mar 18, 2001 CHARLOTTESVILLE - If all goes well next month, an Orion rocket will blast off from Wallops Island and arc 31 miles up and 20 miles out over the ocean, packing a payload of experiments designed by University of Virginia undergraduates. "It is not every day that undergrads get to design instruments for an experiment that will be launched to the edge of space by NASA," said Gabriel Laufer, a professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at U. Jeff Dawson, a fourth-year aerospace engineering student and project leader, said the real-life experience has been a critical part of his education. "Another project I'm working on is designing an aircraft totally on paper," said Dawson. If I want my wings longer I just erase the numbers.</td>
