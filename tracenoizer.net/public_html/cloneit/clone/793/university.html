 Links on each page will always bring you back here. . This site is intended to serve faculty and staff in their efforts at continuous improvement of the University by providing in one place all of the quantitative (and in the future, the anecdotal and qualitative) information we have generated since 1994. Converting all the data and statistical analyses to Web format will take some time, so thank you for your patience. Links on each page will always bring you back here.</td>

 There were four initial activities that the unit was assigned to conduct. They were Planning, Data Administration, Information Resource Management and Institutional Research. The organization of these activity areas within a single unit that reported directly to the President gave great convenience and impetus to efforts to better manage reliability and consistency in the data reported, disseminated and accessible both internal and external to the University. Information Resource Management with data administration a prominent element was linked directly to Planning and Institutional Research within the unit. The organization of the University Planning and Analysis unit resulted in development of both on-line and remote electronic access to data tables and statistics on various university programs.</td>
