These crisis situations require getting information to emergency personnel fast, but what's the best way to deliver it. That was the problem presented to 25 Stanford University Business and Engineering school students in an innovative class designed to develop their ability to construct electronic business processes. The concept for the course originated with Sian last year while he was completing his doctorate in the Design Division of the Engineering School. Over the 10 weeks of winter quarter, each team designed an Internet or Intranet-based system that an organization can use to respond to a crisis.">

 Over a period of eighteen months, a series of three-month placements will take you to a number of our business streams and central functions. Much of your initial involvement will be aimed at building an understanding of how the whole organisation functions and how the various divisions work together. Structured programmes for each placement provide an opportunity to acquire a wealth of business experience and are designed so that, at each stage of your development, your work programme will grow with you. During this time you will engage in presentations to senior management with other graduate trainees as well as receiving department-based training and experience specific to your permanent role. In-house specialist training courses will develop personal and technical skills fundamental to your success throughout the organisation.</td>
