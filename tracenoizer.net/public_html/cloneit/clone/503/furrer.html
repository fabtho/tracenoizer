 . Researchers at Zurich Zoo have put their young Galapagos tortoises on a diet after discovering that some of the animals weigh 10 times as much as those in the wild, and that all the Zurich tortoises were heavier than their counterparts in the Galapagos Islands. The tortoises are now being given food that is lower in energy content and higher in fibre in an attempt to slow their growth, said zoo curator Samuel Furrer in a statement late Wednesday. He added that there was no evidence that their weight was affecting the tortoises' internal organs or that there was a buildup of fat. Twenty-nine tortoises have been born at Zurich Zoo since it began its research project in 1989.</td>

 . Laurrie is a Mom 24 hours of the day 7 days a week. Grandpa and Grandma Furrer have a cabin on a near by lake where the family can enjoy spending many wonderful summer weekends. Once a year or so Bob and Jeanne Holloway drop by to stay in the Bounder Motel and have some fun times with the zoo crew. This year the Furrer's vacationed in Oregon and that was fun.</td>
