These are huge issues - with major implications for corporate management, design and production strategies. 'Sustainable Solutions' provides state-of-the-art analysis and case studies on why and how cutting-edge companies are developing new products and services to fit 'triple-bottom-line' expectations. First, the broad issues of business sustainability are examined with a focus on sustainable production and consumption and consideration of North-South issues. Second, the book tackles the major methodologies and approaches toward organising and developing more sustainable products and services.">
