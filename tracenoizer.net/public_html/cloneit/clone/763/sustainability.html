 These are complex processes, he argued - who better than chemical engineers to deal with them. Roland Clift (Surrey) described a postgraduate course in which a key requirement was to get technical graduates to accept different ways of thinking. Sustainability can only be practical if engineers get to grip with social issues including the perceptions of others. On the other hand, he said, we have a duty to educate others - for example getting policy makers to understand the second law of thermodynamics. Adisa Azapagic (Surrey) gave details of a new IChemE accredited degree in which a quarter of the time was spent on matters closely connected to sustainability.</td>

 These are huge issues - with major implications for corporate management, design and production strategies. 'Sustainable Solutions' provides state-of-the-art analysis and case studies on why and how cutting-edge companies are developing new products and services to fit 'triple-bottom-line' expectations. First, the broad issues of business sustainability are examined with a focus on sustainable production and consumption and consideration of North-South issues. Second, the book tackles the major methodologies and approaches toward organising and developing more sustainable products and services. Third, an outstanding collection of global case studies highlights the progress made by a wide range of companies toward dematerialisation, eco-innovation and design for durability.</td>
