 I truly appreciate his cultivated way of thinking and good nature which still leave me a challenge. . ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This thesis work was carried out during the years 1994-1999 at the Departments of Clinical Chemistry and Biomedicine, University of Helsinki and at the Laboratory of Molecular Genetics of the Helsinki University Central Hospital. I am most grateful to my ecellent supervisor, Professor Aarno Palotie, for introducing me the fascinating world of science. His positive and diplomatic guidance has been indispensable and encouraged me to work in both ups and downs.</td>

 . Benchmarking of Bootstrap Temporal Stereo using Statistical and Physical Scene Modelling Benchmarking of Bootstrap Temporal Stereo using Statistical and Physical Scene Modelling S. of Electronic and Electrical Engineering University of Sheffield Mappin St. uk Abstract Temporal stereo vision algorithms can offer improved robustness, however, this can only be delivered after several frames of a stereo image sequence have been processed. We present a new method of bootstrapping temporal stereo which can overcome such start-up problems by applying additional coarse-to-fine pre-processing to the first few images in a stereo sequence.</td>

 groups where researchers and people from three to four organizations meet on a regular basis to discuss experiences and knowledge of CI-work and to plan interventions connected to studies. The research has theoretical foundations in many disciplines, thus it is a multidisciplinary project. The project is coupled to sister projects at Linkoeping University (CMTO) and at Chalmers University of Technology (CORE) and to the Swedish Council for Work Life Research. Frequencies, type of injury and context of automation accidents are sought from data from mandatory Swedish occupational-injury reports. From field investigations at 21 companies and using an instrument specifically de-veloped for this purpose, the sequence of events involved in automation accidents are described.</td>
