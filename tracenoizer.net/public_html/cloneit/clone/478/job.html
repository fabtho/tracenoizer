 . After all, Candace Bushnell's "Sex and the City" column, when it ran in the New York Observer, generated the same kind of frenzied hype as Helen Fielding's "Bridget" when it first appeared in a London paper. A carpenter hired to add on a room to her flat knocks a hole in the wall, then doesn't finish the job -- and she doesn't do anything about it for six months. Given a crack at a celebrity interview, she makes a fool of herself and then blows the deadline. An ex who accuses her of not knowing where Germany is, is, in fact, absolutely right.</td>

 The Goal Equivalence Model, GEM TEQ is hindered by N-factors such as absenteeism and a high turn-over rate and is improved by P-factors such as motivation, knowledge and responsibility. The working life quality, WLQ, is the basis for the P-factors and a cause of the N-factors. There is also a positive relation between TEQ and WLQ due to job security, pride in working in a successful organization and the rational measures taken by a company understanding the importance of WLQ for TEQ. The model also includes the very important D-tools - work organization, man-machine systems, learning and dialogue, which operate on both TEQ and WLQ. The strength of the relations are dependent on culture.</td>
