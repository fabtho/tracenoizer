 He lurches from one scrape to another in his encounters with two skinheads, a crooked bank manager, and a compulsive shop-lifter. Many of the adults he meets have a grim story, laced with an element of black farce, and their vivid cameo appearances make clear to the reader what Waldemar will soon leave behind. For them the trials are real, ongoing, and offer no hope of escape. Chief among the book's very positive virtues is its sharp visual sense. It captures superbly well Vienna's buildings, parks and streets, with vigorous thumbnail sketches and a sharp eye for different people's characteristic gait and gestures.</td>

" She tried to blame her condition on an older woman in town, but because Willard did not think this woman was a witch, he paid no attention to Elizabeth's accusations. When Willard pressured Elizabeth to tell "the true and real occasion" of her fits, she said that the Devil had appeared to her many times over the previous three years and had offered to make her a witch. " She admitted that the Devil came because of her discontent and that he came much more frequently once she started to work as a servant in the Willard household. As the weeks went by, Elizabeth's fits became worse and she was more confused.</td>

 It's true that the Las Vegas outpost doesn't have the charm of the original; 121 years of weathering is hard to reproduce, even in a city that must employ more trompe l'oeil artists than any other. But a lot of thought has been given to the interior -- even to the patterns of tiny tiles on the floors -- and the sound buffering, furniture arrangements, even the furniture itself, all add to the comfort level. " There's a real dedication to customer service here; it appears that the snobby and stuffy need not apply. Tap water is offered as a viable choice along with bottled; all prices -- even those for the market-price caviar and the daily specials -- are printed on the menu. Even the fact that the specials are printed on a menu insert instead of being reeled off by a server makes things much easier for the customer who might be struggling to remember the details of each.</td>
