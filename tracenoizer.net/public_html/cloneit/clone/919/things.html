 And as we are mostly on perpetual inventory, we can rely on the inventory records at year-end. But by spreading the work we also see a greater creativity in people in terms of how they do their job. Remove that pressure and you will find that people have time to reflect on their processes, fix errors at their sources and find new ways to do things. Have you now reached a point when it is no longer possible to reduce cycle time further. Our vision is to provide timely, quality financial data.</td>

 You can supervise the play and correct your daughter's friend when she's out of line. If the problems come back, you'll know that your house is the safer place to play. If the problem continues, have your neighbor over for coffee to talk things through. Having a neighbor friend was important to me as a child as well. I'm noticing that my daughter sometimes feels hurt when Belinda doesn't take turns (hits, or decides all the games).</td>

 George and Josephine joined the Presbyterian Church there on August 9. Their reasons for making the move are unclear, but perhaps they were influenced by two of Josephine's sisters who had moved there not long before. Things did not go well and, in later years, Josie would recall that they had been promised things in Kansas that they had never received. Their son Wallace also became very ill from bad well water and, in 1888, a severe blizzard blazed a path of destruction over the state. In November of 1889, the LeFevres returned to New York, this time settling in Middletown, Orange County.</td>
