 Such a curve may look graphically obvious, but even from the mathematical viewpoint, four points and a third order equation that define a Bezier curve are considerably more complex than what is used in plain and bloodless geometric primitives. The very word "curve" suggests that the concept of curvature may have some important implications for this geometric object. Therefore, even more important for design is the concept of curvature range. The greater the difference between the most and the least curved fragments of a line, the bigger its curvature range is. From this viewpoint, a straight line and a circle are similar, as they both have zero curvature range (in both cases curvature is constant, although for a straight line it is zero and for a circle it is non-zero).</td>
