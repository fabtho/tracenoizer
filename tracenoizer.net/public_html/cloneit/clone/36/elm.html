 Colonel Graham also mined for gold on the north side of Twin Mountain, but the vein he found did not warrant production. A combination grist and saw mill and cotton gin was located on Salt Creek in a three-story structure, which proved an excellent and necessary business. The mill was later moved to the present location on north Elm Street. The gin was moved approximately a quarter of a mile to the east and served the farming community well into the 20th century. In February 1875, Louis and Urban Bessard were given a lot on the square, right in the middle of the north side, for the consideration of building a good structure to house a blacksmith and gunsmith shop.</td>
