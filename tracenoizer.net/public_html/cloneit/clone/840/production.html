 There's a wonderful diversity here, and the band knows how to make a good song even better. Breakdown Lane and The Way We Live both have a slight roots-rock feel that works wonderfully, with the latter winning out by way of some solid harmonies to complement a breezy rhythm. The band's sound also benefits from the production efforts of band member Brad Page, who does a fantastic job of making the band sound as good as they deserve to sound. There's a lot of passion and talent on Ten Story Love and it's a treat to experience. Really, there's nowhere for this band to go but up.</td>

 Their salvation was in sight though, as grunge exploded, they went back to playing the same old woeful heavy metal and pretended they actually knew where Seattle was. Well this self-titled, self-released debut album sounds to me like that tiny few, those couple of bands that moved from heavy rock into indie pop with success. Whether there is a history of playing "hair" rock in their past I do not know, but they certainly bring a strong sense of that in their use of guitar, production and vocals. First I give my absolute admiration to any band that can produce such a professional album and get it out there for the fans, without the help of even a minor label. Also both Brad Page and Scot Gibbs are accomplished guitarists, songwriters and vocalists.</td>
