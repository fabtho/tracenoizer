 - - - - - - - - - - - - By Jean Hanff Korelitz April 8, 1999 . Back in the 1980s, when I was a lowly editorial assistant by day and trying to be a novelist by night, no god reigned so supreme as the god of literary prose. Lovely, image-laden sentences, paragraphs and pages of verbal music -- these were considered far more laudable than a good story. Any dolt could weave a yarn, but only Writers could set prose aloft on gossamer wings. Back in those days, my most cherished ambition was to have one of my novels published by an established literary house with a print run of a couple of thousand and a respectable advance tipping four figures.</td>

 All Monkey wants to know is when the Recording Industry will realize it is HIS bitch. That's because Ten Story Love, a New England-based rock quartet, plays the same type of overly-happy pop rock on its debut album that you hear used as sitcom theme songs on shows like Friends and Jesse. This is the type of music which has very little lasting value, but corporations like to use it because it's upbeat, inoffensive, and catchy (in a very annoying way). This music just makes you want to sway back and forth with a big, dumb, mindless smile on your face. This stuff should only appeal to the type of people who prefer appearances and a "nice melody you can hum along to" to substance and timelessness.</td>
