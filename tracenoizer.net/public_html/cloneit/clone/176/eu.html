 Because of the limits of the space we will provide them in our reply to the second question. At the same time we try to explore to what extent and how the changing national and international contexts of the 1990s have altered the Finnish "equation of culture and social cohesion". Finland, of course, has experienced the same drastic changes as other Western European countries, with the collapse of the Soviet Union and the membership in the EU as the two more obvious external landmarks. Similarly technology-induced globalisation processes in economic and communication sectors as well as the new more restricted role assigned to the public powers have altered the context of cultural policies too. These changes have had their effects on the problems of social cohesion too.</td>
