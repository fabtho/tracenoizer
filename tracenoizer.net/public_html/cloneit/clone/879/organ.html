Other organ music includes works in forms later used by Bach, fugues, toccatas, fantasias and a set of six chaconnes. Church Music Pachelbel composed a number of sacred concertos, works for voices and a small group of instruments on sacred texts as well as a number of Magnificat and other settings for the evening service of Vespers.</td>

He left some 278 keyboard works, which, in general, show his technical skill. Chamber Music Equally prolific in chamber music for various groups of instruments, Albrechtsberger based many of his instrumental compositions on the church sonata of the Baroque period, with its contrapuntal content.</td>

 It is a great new contribution to 20th century piano literature. This composer has something to say and says it most eloquently. Cooman's piano and organ music has been featured on radio programs on Eastside Radio 2RES in Sydney, Australia, and his music has been broadcast on Vatican Radio. His piano work Kayser Variations (1997) was the subject of a published article by Canadian musicologist Gordon Rumson. Cooman's own musicology studies and writings have been focused primarily on the music of composers Peter Maxwell Davies, Howard Hanson, Daniel Pinkham, and Robert Ward.</td>
