 This is largely because I don't have a recording of Carmina Burana in my collection. There are likely some other more modern, choral-only composers that are not represented either, as well as many experimental composers, and even perhaps a few composers that you believe absolutely should be included but aren't. For more general information on composers, including biographies and recommended recordings, see the Master Composer Index. These files have been developed by a number of contributors over a period of time, and thus the format varies for each works list depending on the information presented, and the types of data compiled by the contributor.
