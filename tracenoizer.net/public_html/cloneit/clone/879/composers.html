 For more general information on composers, including biographies and recommended recordings, see the Master Composer Index. . These are all composers from the database I keep for my CD collection. For instance, it has been brought to my attention many times that my lists omit Carl Orff (1895-1982), except for the graphical timelines. This is largely because I don't have a recording of Carmina Burana in my collection.</td>

 1 Aaron Cohen's Encyclopedia of Women Composers lists 6,196 women composers. . In fact, this list represents only a tiny fraction of more than 6000 women composers about whom a record exists. 1 Only composers of classical music whose works have been recorded on compact disc have been included in this database. Composers are listed in alphabetical order; their name is followed by their date of birth and country of origin.</td>
