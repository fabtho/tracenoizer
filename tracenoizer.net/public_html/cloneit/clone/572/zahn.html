 22, 1997 IN THE SUPREME COURT STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA 1997 ND 65 State of North Dakota, Plaintiff and Appellee v. 960190 Appeal from the District Court for Dickey County, Southeast Judicial District, the Honorable Ronald E. We affirm, concluding the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding Zahn in contempt. Zahn appeared in Dickey County District Court on July 18, 1996, as a witness for the State in Fregien's trial. Because Zahn had previously engaged in disruptive behavior in the courthouse and in the courtroom, the district court warned him about possible contempt charges if such behavior continued.</td>
