I hope that this will stimulate us to take a creative approach to the study of old books and especially to the curatorship and the exhibiting of collections of them. I have wanted to open up an area in which we will look at books not only as technology and not only as art or craft and not only as text and not only as publishing history but in the mode of being a book -- in its own unique meaning and character fully and essentially conceived. This involves considering not the scientific or scholarly nature of the book but the emotional basis of our interest in books.">
