 "The people I've come to know through this work have inspired me. They've helped me understand the importance of living for today, and they've made me very thankful for everything I have. " Weber plans to pursue a career in hospice care for older adults, but her career path has not always been so well defined. After high school, she spent years working in "making ends meet" jobs in the restaurant, banking and graphics industries. She'd always been interested in social work, but never thought of college as an option.</td>
