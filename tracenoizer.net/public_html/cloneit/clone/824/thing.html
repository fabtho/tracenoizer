 If you like Neil Gaiman's Sandman, or just horror and fantasy in general, you will fall in love with this book. . The modern comics landscape has been changed by the Vertigo line of books--an imprint that traces its roots back to this version of Swamp Thing. By taking a horror character fully entrenched in a superhero world (as silly as that might seem), this creative team put a new face on horror comics and on horror in general. Don't let the mediocre Swamp Thing movies fool you, this book is filled with sophisticated suspense and terror.</td>

Lutus Message Page -- It is no accident that modern education doesn't teach the distinction between symbol and thing -- if it did, education as we know it would fall apart. After that, after education reshaped itself to provide actual knowledge instead of the symbolic representation of knowledge, the society around us would be transformed.</td>
