 is moving full speed ahead in the home health care arena, harnessing technology along the way as it builds market share. The Dallas-based company, which went public in August 1996, already has grown at a rapid clip in a burgeoning industry. Its twin strategies to offer a full range of services and make the most of technology have fueled that effort. HealthCor's "superior information system" should allow it to drive down its nursing operating costs while improving the quality of care, as well as the accuracy and accessibility of documentation, according to Emch. That boost in productivity, combined with more accurate patient data, should give the company a continuing competitive advantage over smaller operators, Emch said.</td>

 Analysts say such systems are available individually. The hospital would replace HealthSouth's flagship Birmingham medical center, which had been scheduled for a major renovation. Scrushy said equipment and services can be transferred from the existing hospital, which means the new project won't significantly increase his company's projected capital expenditures. The hospital will be built near HealthSouth's 92-acre corporate campus here. The project will use Oracle's electronic-business software as the basis for communications and management systems, and Oracle will work with HealthSouth to develop new health-care software.</td>
