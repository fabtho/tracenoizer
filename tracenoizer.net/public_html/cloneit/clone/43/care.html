Health care analyst Peter Emch of Credit Suisse First Boston said digital record keeping should speed up doctors' rounds by making it easier for them to access patient documents. "Certainly the acute care hospital industry could use modernization," he said. Swaid, a neurosurgeon who is working as a consultant to HealthSouth, said the hospital should provide safer, more efficient care.</td>
