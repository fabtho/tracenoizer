 Scrushy said equipment and services can be transferred from the existing hospital, which means the new project won't significantly increase his company's projected capital expenditures. The hospital will be built near HealthSouth's 92-acre corporate campus here. The project will use Oracle's electronic-business software as the basis for communications and management systems, and Oracle will work with HealthSouth to develop new health-care software. John Wookey, the Oracle senior vice president in charge of developing its health-care business, said the company has been working for the past year to adapt its electronic-business systems for health-care uses. Oracle will oversee integration of the project's technology, working with various medical-equipment firms and service providers to ensure systems are compatible.</td>
