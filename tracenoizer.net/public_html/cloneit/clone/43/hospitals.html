 .The plan was delayed because Congress passed a Medicare law that required the agency to change the way rates are calculated, said Scott Estes, an analyst with Deutsche Banc Alex. The law eliminated an expected 2 percent reduction in reimbursement rates and gave hospitals the option of switching to the new payment system without phasing it in over three years, Estes said. The delay could affect Healthsouth if it lasts more than three months though, because that could force an even longer delay in adding its hospitals to the new payment system, he said. HCFA did not tell Healthsouth when the system would be implemented, McVay said.</td>

New technologies don't get adopted if hospitals can't pay.</td>

And he said he doesn't want Columbia's 342 acute care hospitals. Scrushy sent a fax to Frist on July 23, offering to buy Columbia outright, but never got a reply. He said the offer was just an effort to get his company to the table for any future decisions, anyway.</td>
