Boyesen integrates in her practise the bio-energetic current of the sixties favouring the therapeutic work by emotional catharasis and primal regression. Words and images seeming to them important therapeutic tools, biodynamic psychotherapists have integrated them to their organic work in respecting the fundamental postulate of selfregulation linked to peristaltic action (micro-regulation). Rather than a juxtaposition of analytic concepts to their body-work, they have sought links between verbalisation, image productions and energetical movements in the body. In an other way they considered the relational aspect in therapeutic cure more carefully and have introduced the Freudian notions of transference and counter-transference in their work.</td>
