 Rather than a juxtaposition of analytic concepts to their body-work, they have sought links between verbalisation, image productions and energetical movements in the body. In an other way they considered the relational aspect in therapeutic cure more carefully and have introduced the Freudian notions of transference and counter-transference in their work. The Psycho-Organic Circle and the Primary Impulse Training offer a reading and diagnosis scale allowing to understand how primary energy, first undifferenciated finds an incarnate shape in a specific action or expression. On the other way the Primary Impulse Training shows the strength of images as levers of transformation in a therapeutic process. A chain of daydreamings creating precise archetypal images, enables to symbolise the emergences of the unconscious and undertightens the individuation of the person.</td>
