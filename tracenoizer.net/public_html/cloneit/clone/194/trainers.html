 For the patient there is no confusion about to which medical vision to adhere. Many allopathic trained doctors in developing countries hesitate to openly support herbal medicine, for fear of not being taken seriously. By offering courses in homeopathy and establishing a Trainer of Trainers programme, the cooperation between allopathy, homeopathy and herbal medicine becomes possible. We also have been asked to advice for the establishment of new trainings for traditional healers. The increase in pluriformity of treatment modalities offered in a clinic contributes to the effectiveness of the care and the emancipation of herbal medicine.</td>
