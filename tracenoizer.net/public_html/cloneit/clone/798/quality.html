 For instance, to evaluate the emergency room capabilities of a hospital, you may want to ask for the percentage of board-certified physicians in emergency medicine and the number of emergency room visits that occurred in the past year. If you have children, ask about their capabilities to treat pediatric emergencies. Ask the hospital for information on how it monitors quality-of-care. Ask for patient outcome data on the number of patient injuries due to falls or other mishaps. Ask for the results of patient or staff satisfaction surveys.</td>
