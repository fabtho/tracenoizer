 Please consult the section on alignment inheritance for details. 3 Interpretation of language codes In the context of HTML, a language code should be interpreted by user agents as a hierarchy of tokens rather than a single token. When a user agent adjusts rendering according to language information (say, by comparing style sheet language codes and lang values), it should always favor an exact match, but should also consider matching primary codes to be sufficient. Thus, if the lang attribute value of "en-US" is set for the HTML element, a user agent should prefer style information that matches "en-US" first, then the more general value "en". Language code hierarchies do not guarantee that all languages with a common prefix will be understood by those fluent in one or more of those languages.</td>
