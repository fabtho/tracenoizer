Wedding a technical notion to a basic organic form redefined, he has patiently fashioned a bijou range of architectural hardware that can quietly claim to be technically and aesthetically rethinking a classic design range. ..</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="1"<td valign="bottom"> Magnussen, however, is one of several designer collections commissioned by FSB. Along with other designers such as Philippe Stark, Franco-Clivio, Hartmut Weise and Dieter Rams this forms part of FSB's response to the ever growing demand for designer fittings at surprisingly competitive costs. The Glencar Range has a new style and superb springing mechanism. The 1500 push-to-release window fastener's superb engineering coupled with its attractive design make this an excellent fastener which offers "security with style". New to Basta range are handles and espagnolettes suitable for use with the PVC-u steel, aluminium and timber windows.</td><tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="4"><td valign="center"> New products are launched every year within the FSB range and this year, at the Spectrum exhibition at the Royal College of Art, FSB showed off its latest creation - a Nordic wing-beat in stainless steel for European doors by Danish designer Erik Magnussen. . fsb - allgood johannes potente jasper morrison philippe starck hartmut weise franco clivio dieter rams contact design for berlin erikmagnussen Following a commercial interest of some years, in 1994 Allgood took on whole ownership of FSB Design Hardware Limited, thus becoming the sole UK distributors of the FSB range of Architectural Hardware.
