 Because I Love myself, I can be truthful with myself and others. . A place of Love is where I came from, where I am now, and where I will return. Coming into this embodiment, I have had many teachings to learn and many things to do. Love is the essence of all the teachings and all the doing.</td>

 Thank You for your much appreciated and encouraged comments. . Love makes all the difference -- well certainly a huge difference. Without any doubt I've said and meant and believed all these statements. I feel all this 'love' stuff when practiced without compassion and understanding and acceptance, leaves a space for judgment and dismissal.</td>
