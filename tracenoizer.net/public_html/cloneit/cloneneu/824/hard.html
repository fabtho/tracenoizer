Could be that you just didn't take the time out to really understand each other from the beginning. However, if any damage was done and the smoke clears, forgive them, bless them and wish them the best without ever holding a grudge or having hard feelings. Grudges and hard feelings are for the insecure and petty. If the friendship was meant to be then it will exist.">

Kidman tried so hard that she cracked a rib and tore the cartilage in the back of her knee. In spite of her declarations of slowing down, it's hard to see when that is going to happen.

 Tired of reading online forums, bulletin boards, etc because they seem so negative. Wonder why drivers seem to complain so much, yet they do the job anyway. This was a hard article to write because so often the things I love are also the things that I don't love. This is an ongoing article that will be added to as I think of more things.
