 But - and I insist on this - nobody has made any official statement about the demise of the JPS Experience. Keyboards player Russell Baillie left way back in 1992, and after the Noisyland tour the next year, guitarist Dave Mulcahy deserted the ship to set up Superette. At present, Gary Sullivan is making loud banging noises for a band which specialises in that sort of thing - Solid Gold Hell. Meanwhile, Yetton seems to be doing Wellington-type things. Johnny I do know that Yetton is planning on releasing a solo album about June.</td>

 We are still trapped in the "tropism of hommo-sexuality" here, aren't we. I don't believe there is a difference between playing on the phallic economy and playing in it -- but, my ability to see the subtleties and subvert the "straight mind" has been eroded by TV, like most peoples. I am the "thing" that is a symptom of my own psychic state rather than existing in the "real" world of movies, magazines and TV. I am imagining me and imaging me and perhaps something of you in this writing. In inscribing my stretch marks, et al, in discourse through writing (the ambiguous space between seeing and not seeing) (another quote from someone).</td>

 In this elegantly written and argued neo-Luddite thesis, Spretnak passionately speaks on behalf of a more enlightened post modern ecology that actively eschews the deadening embrace of 20th century scientism and technological industrialism and recognizes the basic human connection to nature and the environment. But the leap toward such critical awareness eludes many of our contemporaries, who are locked into such a modernistic, mechanistic and rational worldview that they tend to view themselves as bio-machines requiring external interventions when malfunctioning. Every thing about our artificially created and sustained human environment holds us within this kind of faulty and dangerous world-view. Instead, she argues, we need to recognize that we are self-correcting energy systems operating within nature, which she defines as a dynamic and self-regulating cosmos. This is heady and quite intellectually stimulating stuff, and requires a close reading and a requisite ability to think, as they say, "outside the box" of conventional thought.</td>
