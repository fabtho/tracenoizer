 Loss of activity in a single enzyme can inactivate an entire pathway. Archibald Garrod, in 1902, first proposed the relationship through his study of alkaptonuria and its association with large quantities "alkapton". He reasoned unaffected individuals metabolized "alkapton" (now called homogentistic acid) to other products so it would not buildup in the urine. Garrod suspected a blockage of the pathway to break this chemical down, and proposed that condition as "an inborn error of metabolism". He also discovered alkaptonuria was inherited as a recessive Mendelian trait.</td>

 All family members with known tertiary structure have the same fold. However, ligand specificity, affinity, and bound cavity locations can differ greatly within the family. To identify possible amino acids involved in the binding specificity of ALBP, comparisons were made between ALBP and cellular retinoic acid binding protein type I (CRABP I). CRABP I was selected because it exhibits differences in its ligand binding specificity, affinity, and location. Based on these comparisons, two separate ALBP mutations were made to mimic CRABP I at two positions which stand out as possible points of binding specificity.</td>
