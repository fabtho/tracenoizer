 " Curl let Knapp up at the beginning of the second period, then converted a pretty single shot to a double and a takedown for a 9-2 lead. . That came yesterday afternoon in the 275-pound final at the NJSIAA Wrestling Tournament at the Continental Airlines Arena in front of what remained of the crowd of 9,987. On this day, Curl was simply too fast and aggressive and rolled to an 11-5 win. For the second straight year, the soft-spoken Crusader lost in the state finals.</td>

 Someone jumped and we all nearly had our feet in the peddles before the whistle blew. I was so amped up to get to that corner first I spun my rear wheel in the wet grass. But still had daylight in front of me in which to sprint into. Not a bad position really as I later learned that there was a big stack up in this corner. I can only imagine the agony of such a setback so soon in the race.</td>

 Stephen's Episcopal, and are tied for fifth with Orlando Lake Highland Prep. "I putted very good," said Ureta, who has been in the United States for two months and lives with his parents at Saddlebrook. He birdied three consecutive holes on the front nine (six, seven and eight) and had four birdies on the back nine. Not bad after playing only nine holes in Monday's practice round. "It would've been better to see the whole course, but I'll take this score," Ureta said.</td>
