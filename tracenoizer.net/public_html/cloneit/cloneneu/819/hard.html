 . I don't follow the monthly series, but whenever a new collection is on the shelves, I'm among the first in line to read the further adventures of John Constantine, the resident attitudinal mage of the DC universe. Unfortunately, Hard Time was a horrible disappointment. The book begins with Constantine's admission into a tough American prison after being convicted of murder. I certainly believe there's a place for ugly stories in this world; they often need to be told.</td>
