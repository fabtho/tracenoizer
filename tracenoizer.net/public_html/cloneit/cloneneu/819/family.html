 For the moment I have vacation from School, so I'm working in a computer company where I build computers and install software on them. I've been working in that company for about 18 months, but not full time. So, when I'm finished I want to go to Williamsport because I've got family there. I have experience in sales, customer service and computer skills. My computer skills include word, excel, spreadsheet, adobe photoshop( IBM and Mac's) I am a very hard worker and have labor skills.</td>
